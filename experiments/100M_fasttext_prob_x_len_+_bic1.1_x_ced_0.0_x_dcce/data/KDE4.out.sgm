<seg id="14">"each object is represented by a rectangle, whose surface is proportional to its size. this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the lower objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object."</seg>
<seg id="15">"& FSView; the size of a file or folder shows the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files can be easily detected even if they are located far below in the folder hierarchy. accordingly, & FSView can be seen as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX command."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in & FSview, an entry in the Treemap representation is a rectangle representing a file or folder in your file system."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the color of a rectangle that is switched over view color mode can either represent depth for easy detection of nesting depth or the image of another file property, such as name, owner, group or MIME type."</seg>
<seg id="18">"a rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder. for each feature, you can specify whether or not it is displayed at all, only if there is enough space for display or whether the area of lower rectangles may be used. furthermore, you can specify the relative position of the caption in the rectangle."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in case of representation algorithms for treemaps the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. at the Treemap in & FSview, this target is not always maintained. note that less space is lost for the frame if the rectangle is square."</seg>
<seg id="20">"how division of the area of an entry takes place for the subordinate entries is left to the implementation. here it is advisable for caption and to avoid space losses due to frame, that rectangles are created that are as square. the best methods in this regard are lines, columns or recursive divisions."</seg>
<seg id="21">"you can set the minimum displayed area for an entry via the menu entry View to hold on area. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry."</seg>

<seg id="70">"once you have configured the base folder, you can set up & digikam across your digital camera. then you should learn how to use My Albums and My Cutter button to manage your photos in the albums."</seg>
<seg id="71">"support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported shell cameras in the help of raw camera support."</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections of Roh DecoderSettings and Roh workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">"an easy-to-use camera interface will be provided to you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digikam; -albums download. of course, every medium and every card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with & digikam."</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. the camera then appears as a disk drive. the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may also use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">"gPhoto2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol, a widespread protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers."</seg>
<seg id="76">"many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer. since photos in general are large files and transfers over the serial port are slow, this connection is outdated. & digicame; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found at this link."</seg>
<seg id="77">"libgphoto2 must have been created with libexif support so that the thumbnails can be read reliably by digiKam. if the exif support is not available in libgphoto2, you might be able to see thumbnails or the creation could be very slow."</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things to say is how easy it is to expand its functionality by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image plug-in Interface Project (manual) is a common module structure for & digikam; KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and Gwenview. the goal is to provide the modules for all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section. "</seg>
<seg id="80">"modules can manipulate images in virtually any way as a user can. their advantage is that it is much simpler, & digikam; by writing a small module to add a function when the changes in & digicame; even perform."</seg>
<seg id="81">"to simplify the window, you can either remove the page bars with & LMB; remove or switch to full screen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F."</seg>
<seg id="82">"drag and drop pictures will work everywhere: you can place an image in another part of the Albenbaums, above the horizontal divider line or into another application window. the only restriction is that a picture cannot be placed in keywords, data list or search."</seg>
<seg id="83">"- a file type selector allows you to undo the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, Movies and Audio"</seg>
<seg id="84">"the text filter will only be used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view. thus, filtering on the filename only works if this is shown in the symbol view. which fields are displayed, you can configure the settings in the dialog of the settings."</seg>
<seg id="85">"all photos, edited by & digikam, are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were recorded on the hard disk, after the name of their collection in the albenproperties or after the date on which the album was first created. the date can be changed in the properties of the album."</seg>
<seg id="86">"if you have installed a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. select Album Import images to scan. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album."</seg>
<seg id="87">"to copy or move a picture from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it. in the then appearing menu, you must select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. simply select all the photos and move them to the target album."</seg>

<seg id="238">"PNG has been designed as an open source standard to replace GIF. it can save much more. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. PNG is able to store gamma- and chromaticity data for improved color assignments on heterogeneous platforms. the disadvantage is that there are relative many administrative information, but not as many as TIFF and a slow compression."</seg>
<seg id="239">"TIFF was widely used as image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with lossless compression algorithm (Deflate). however, a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people. therefore, there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types."</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative File Format is a royalty-free and open source image format developed by Adobe Systems.

<seg id="377">"the reason why you use a color-managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner can have a predictable deviation from the actually photographed resp. scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow, you can achieve that the colors on your monitor resemble those from your camera or scanner, and that the colours you print or publish on the web to those from your digital darkroom."</seg>
<seg id="378">"if the theme is on color management, then everyone wants to know which buttons it needs to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at every point of the image processing workflows. in addition, you should provide links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions so you get the desired result."</seg>
<seg id="379">"if your image workflow meets all of the six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about color management."</seg>

<seg id="381">"your only other images are by email or web, where sRGB is the de facto standard."</seg>

<seg id="388">"this tool provides five automatic corrections, which can improve an image in most cases. therefore, use it before you attempt a further manual processing."</seg>
<seg id="389">"the functions Normalize, Compare, Automatic Compare and Contrast Expand from the menu Correction Automatic correction automatically try to make the most of your colors the best. you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo."</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scales the luminance values over the entire image so that the darkest point is black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">"similar: this method uses the color of the color of the selected image to adjust the histogram of the intensity channel as flat as possible. sometimes it produces very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only garbage. it is a very powerful operation that causes either miracles in a picture or it destroys it."</seg>
<seg id="392">"automatic calibration: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and light border tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram area."</seg>
<seg id="393">"contrast: this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the widest possible range and a realtime of all values in between. this is only visible in washed images, and can be a good correction for bad photos."</seg>
<seg id="394">White balance by & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool to perform white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">"the white balance correction is slightly limited as a color space with 8-bit per color is worked. if you can carry out the white balance in the raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction will be better."</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by Pawel T. Jochym.</seg>
<seg id="397">"the preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left hand side you can see both the original picture as well as the preview of the picture. if you want to see the original white balance again, then click on the subwindow."</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel below this marker is shown as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">"on the top right, a histogram shows that dynamically changes when you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit images, most pixels have very small luminance values. with one button, you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called Luminance."</seg>
<seg id="400">"the contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. the shadow adjustment lets you improve the shadow details of your photos or dim them down."</seg>
<seg id="401">"to play Anstat with the controls above, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance. in this way, the temperature and green values are set automatically."</seg>
<seg id="402">"in addition, you can set the white balance with the default settings list. the following settings are available:"</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed. you will get the combined result in white balance. this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The Save As and Load buttons make this exactly. each adjustment of the white balance you have set can then be saved into a text file and then loaded again.</seg>
<seg id="405">"the Preferences button brings all filter values back to their default values and the related neutral white balance. note that even neutral settings will result in another photo as your original. if you save these settings, your original picture will be changed."</seg>
<seg id="406">"you can set the encoding depth per color channel of the processed image. 8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16 bit coding is better suited for high-quality images. this encoding also requires more disk space, calculating time and stands only for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG."</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the processing of raw images. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. colour mapping can be done through the window for the brightness. a detailed guide to use color profiles can be used to consult chapter color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">"another important tool is to find color value correction in the menu. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time, allowing you to use multiple color channels simultaneously. this is helpful if your camera or scanner always needs the same error and you will always need the same correction. in the manual for sound correction, you will find more information."</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility to correct exposure issues is the tool for gradation that you can find in color gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">"the & digicode; tool color effects will provide you with four colour effects, a solar power effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a kantenfilter."</seg>
<seg id="411">"in times of chemical processing was called Solarisation, also called Sabatier, an effect that was created when you replaced a partially developed pressure with a short flash light. this had the effect that the lighter areas darker and the colors were inverted by the second illumination. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine."</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar activity. at approx. 50% intensity the image shows what is chemically possible. another upliftment eventually creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photopaper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the Solarisation effect. the original image is the (1) and that processes the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">"the Vivid filter simulates the so-called" "Velviaquot" "effect. it differs from saturation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing."</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an inverse color film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the sliders repeats the strength of the neon light.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and brightness of the photo. all your adjustments can be seen in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result you can use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">"when you make a photo in poor light conditions, you can get the opposite problem: a too big saturation. also in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation rather than increase it. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok."</seg>
<seg id="419">"between the complex tool gradation and the simple luminous intensity / contrast / gamma, the tool is a key correction for improvement of exposure. even if the dialog with this tool works very complicated, you need only the range of sliders for the purposes described here."</seg>
<seg id="420">"the window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, active channel or selected area. below the graph three sliders are clicked into which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas."</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn how to use it is to move the controls and observe how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">"on the right, the original and the preview of the picture can be viewed. the preview will be updated dynamically based on the settings of the image. on the left hand side, the following options are available."</seg>
<seg id="423">"scaling: with this selection box it can be set whether the histogram is displayed with a linear or logarithmic y axis. for images of a digital camera, linear representation is often dominated by a single column. in this case the logarithmic distribution is more useful."</seg>
<seg id="424">"three controls: the upper one for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones, often called gamma-values."</seg>

<seg id="479">& digikam; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">"sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but generated especially in dark areas, grainy images."</seg>
<seg id="481">"blurred mask works at the contrast of edges to make an image sharper. actually, it does not sharpen any bit, it works rather psychedeluell. you can use it to remove atmospheric Dunst and it makes a really good job here. the algorithm has been taken from Gimp and it is protected by Winston Chang."</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is possibly the best of the three because it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has various parameters for customizing.</seg>
<seg id="483">"images without focus, as well as most digitalized pictures require a correction of the sharpness. this is because the digitalisation process can be combined with minimal differences to one colour point. the same phenomenon can be observed when ink points are printed on paper. SLR cameras usually require more subsequently sharpening than normal cameras for private users."</seg>
<seg id="484">"in JPEG pictures, a camera has often been used internally. pictures in raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners use a sharpener already while reading the image. if you disable this you will get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">"in some situations, you can get useful results by sharpening the sharpness of the sharpness of the sharpness of the sharpness."</seg>
<seg id="487">"the sharpness of the edges increases the sharpness of the edges, but also strengthens the noise. in general, the most suitable technique for sharpening an image intensifies the tool. below refocusing, you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: one image is too crunchy. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than sharpening it. use the tool to soften the softener with the menu item Corrigible softeners and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unsharp masking is a very good tool for removing veils from your photos. you can see a demonstration here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview help to edit the image. the preview window will show the output of the filter using the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often generate good results and should be tried first. if you make the blurred mask too strong, noise and the impression of grates will create close to sharp edges."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius turns one like many pixels on each side of an edge affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. therefore you should sharpen pictures best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the wiped image that is added to the original. thus the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">"the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applying difference amount. thus, a minimal difference can be defined for an edge of the filter. thus, areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded and therefore plastic defects in faces, heavens and water surfaces are avoided."</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example of the blurred masking filter. the original image is the (1) and the modified image (2). blurred was used with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digipist; tool refocused refocused a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted draining filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is a better approach than trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filtering. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filtering. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filtering. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of an blurred mask.</seg>
<seg id="498">"the cast's folding has a very long tail, which results in the mathematical result also from the swelling pixies removed far from the original quell pixel. the FIR Viennese Inverse of the Gauss cleavage is also very strongly influenced by the distant pixels. this causes unwanted results."</seg>
<seg id="499">"a circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular fold. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most images, the default value should yield 1 good results."</seg>
<seg id="500">"correlation: an increase in the correlation can help to reduce artifacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and values close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharper effect of the module."</seg>
<seg id="501">"noise filter: an increase in noise filter can help you reduce artifacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are only rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very bad."</seg>
<seg id="502">"use this parameter if your blurred gauss is wrong. in most cases, use this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you use a nonzero value, you might need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">"die size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in die size can produce good results, especially if you choose large values for this parameter. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocused parameters you set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">"try to perform all clipping, color and intensity corrections on the image before using the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not visible immediately, but leave unpleasant artifacts later."</seg>
<seg id="507">"if you want to read and compress images, eg. as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image."</seg>
<seg id="508">"generally, non-sharp masking produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by blurring a larger neighborhood as sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="509">Even under optimal conditions the result of the FIR Wiener Filters is always at least as good as the blurred mask. the FIR Wiener Filter is often better when processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp colouring has to be corrected. this image has been made with an analog camera. the unfocussed result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">You can read a technical comparison in English under this address for more information on the sharpness correction methods in digital images.</seg>
<seg id="513">The Glätte controls the blurring of the area of the dark to produce a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">"the ink ink allows a customized color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can set it here."</seg>
<seg id="515">Tool error correction is one of the most advanced tools to remove unwanted artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS labs in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different presets as starting points to simplify restauration. the available default settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">"if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely, you can use the smoothing and advanced settings."</seg>
<seg id="519">"detail keeping p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of details. a small value leads to uniform smoothing over the image. a value of 0.9 should keep details such that no sharpening is necessary afterwards."</seg>
<seg id="520">"direction dependency Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions, while a value close to 1 is smoothed only in one direction. if you have a film gradation or CCD noise will produce a high value wave-like pattern. JPEG artefacts are best eliminated by a value near 1."</seg>
<seg id="521">"smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above ally. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore set this value matching the degree of noise in your image."</seg>
<seg id="522">"rule: [0, 100]: this parameter affects bigger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed. this is necessary if very much noise exists, since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it must be placed higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="523">Repeat: indicates how often the algorithm is passed. usually 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">"angle-scale da [5, 90]: angle dependent integration of anisotropic Alpha. if alpha is selected small, it should also be selected small. make sure that small angles make a long run time. thus, you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs."</seg>
<seg id="525">"integral step width [0,1, 10]: integral step width in pixels. you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2."</seg>
<seg id="526">"use linear interpolation: the more quality you receive by choosing this option is only low, but it doubles the runtime. we therefore recommend it to omit it."</seg>
<seg id="527">The Save As and Load buttons make this exactly. any adjustment of image errors can be saved into a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">"correct image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and load a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the Cancel button."</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how to remove image errors with small artefacts. the module is used on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you see there is a strange black artifact in the background that caused by a bad film storage during the trip. the original picture is below (1) to see and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digicode; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">"this tool provides selectable image filters to remove spots and other artifacts, e.g. from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from camera or moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines."</seg>

<seg id="535">"radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter."</seg>
<seg id="536">"sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel distance that the filter looks forward to detect luminance changes. if the value is too high, the adaptive Filter can no longer receive image details and noise or lubricating occurs again."</seg>
<seg id="537">"this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, not the entire noise can be removed or noise peaks can occur. set it to a value near the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG-artefacts without losing any details."</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance variance of the image. we recommend that you change colour or light density to improve an image. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend that you change colour or light density to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is checked by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gamma: controls the image tolerances of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of darker areas, which are typically harder to smoke. however, it also eliminates the shadow areas."</seg>
<seg id="541">"attenuation: controls the adjustment of phase jitter absorption. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius responds to variations of the luminance. if it is increased, the edges appear smoother when it is too high."</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and load: these buttons are used exactly for this. all parameters for noise reduction that you have set can be saved to the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). the noise reduction was applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">"sometimes a picture is too tight for your purpose. fortunately, the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use tool to soften the softener with the menu item Corrigible softeners and experiment with the smoothness. the preview window on the right of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo."</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digitized; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">"this Restoration filter gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts from your images. it is very well adapted to remove Gauss's noise, film gradation, scratches, compression artefacts and local errors that appear in digital, original or subsequently digitalized pictures. smoothing takes place along the image contours and thereby preserves the content as well as the human eye."</seg>
<seg id="547">"the same algorithm can be used for color and texture replacement. the texture replacement is performed with another tool, the image error correction, and the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS labs in Caen / Franconia and is part of the CImg project."</seg>
<seg id="548">"JPEG artefacts: JPEG compression is not perfect, in some areas even very far from it. as a lossy compression algorithm, it generates some compression & quot; artifacts" "; - small standards that can be seen in the uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems."</seg>
<seg id="549">The Save as and Load buttons make this exactly. any adjustment of photo restoration can be saved into a text file and loaded later.</seg>

<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filtering method. all pixels with a spacing of 2 or less to pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a spacing of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic turns (1-dim) which is then used to polish the defective pixels in the block.</seg>

<seg id="568">"however, many center filters need a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the aperture filter that increases the necessary shutter speed in circumstances such that it is impossible to use the camera with the hand. wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, as otherwise blurred effects can occur through movement."</seg>
<seg id="569">"with the large exposure ranges of today's film and the color or gray scales of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a center filter by applying a center filter to a picture. the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker."</seg>
<seg id="570">"with three controllers, you can control the Vignetting correction filter and with three more exposure of the target image."</seg>
<seg id="571">"density: this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of the greatest density of the filter. the standard density amounts to 2.0, which means an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1, or randomly a light intensity of 2, unlocks it to compensate for a small degree."</seg>
<seg id="572">"luminous intensity, contrast and gamma setting: editing an image with the Vignetting correction decreases the brightness of pixels. you need to adjust the exposure of the target picture with these options."</seg>

<seg id="579">"the coefficient of the engraver corrects the distant edges opposite to that of the second grade. if you combine these two, any geometrical distortion can be almost eliminated."</seg>
<seg id="580">"in general, this value controls the thickness of distortion second degrees. negative values can be corrected to correct tonnal distortions and positive values of cushion distortion."</seg>
<seg id="581">"corner: this value controls the thickness of the distortion. this value appears more strongly than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses, the vertices have the opposite sign of the parameter."</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value resumes the image size and thus performs a correction of first grades.</seg>
<seg id="583">"bright: this value adjusts the brightness in the corners of the picture. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values increase it."</seg>
<seg id="584">"to help you find the best filter settings, the Preview dialog illustrates the distortion correction. the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start."</seg>
<seg id="585">"the ton- or cushion-shaped correction should be performed in front of all cutting or size changes. preferably, perform this correction as all first. if you re-cut a picture and then perform a tonnal correction, the effect would obviously be the wrong."</seg>
<seg id="586">"to help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal assistance line. move the mouse pointer in the picture preview to fix the dotted lines. then move the mouse pointer in the picture preview to fix the dotted lines. then you can correct the ton- / cushion distortion with the help of the lines."</seg>
<seg id="587">"if you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove them using the cutting tool in the Transformers File menu or via the Zoom knob of this dialog."</seg>
<seg id="588">"the next logical step for some motifs, such as pictures from the front, frame and paintings, is the perspective to correct that all angles in the image have 90 degrees. note that when you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective."</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the barrel-shaped correction applied to a church in Norway. the original picture is shown below (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">"the algorithm is based on a method for simulating the infra-red film of the GimpGuru.org website which is accessible under this URL. the filter reproduces the known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfrared film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO."</seg>

<seg id="592">"below the preview, you can set two parameters for film gradation and sensitivity of film (ISO). activate the Option joining film gradation if you want to simulate the granular texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO controller changes the amount of film grain and the dominance of green (chlorophyll in nature) in transformation. green meadows are white like snow!"</seg>
<seg id="593">"since the filter mixes colour channels for producing infrared film, especially the green channel, it makes no sense to apply the effect to black / white photos as the colour information is missing."</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photograph from New Zealand. the original image is shown below (1) and the edited image below (2). the film sensitivity was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the spotlights.</seg>
<seg id="595">"the & digicode; Filter film gradation is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film gradation on your pictures. this is known by classic high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films producers mix large silver grains of photo emulsion."</seg>
<seg id="596">"the film gradation effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. the treated image gets rid of a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life. if you want this special, gallery-like, streetphotographic, grainy sight especially in your monochrome photos, you must use this filter."</seg>
<seg id="597">"the controller can calibrate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the standard value is, although often higher values are needed, to ISO-2400. if you need more grains, you can apply the filter several times."</seg>

<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original picture is marked with (1) and the machined is marked with (2). brush size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and smooth 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">"the lines, which define the outlines of the drawing, are emphasized. images whose gradients must change slowly are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine which scene you would have chosen to outline you. this would be good pictures to start with it."</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controllers with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper controller selects the pin size and the lower adjusts the contrast (smoothness).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon label filter. the original picture (1) and the changed image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be improved even further by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>

<seg id="615">Zoom blurry: blurring the image along star-shaped lines that emanate from a focal point. this simulates the blurring a zooming camera and thus generates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blurring: blurring the image by turning the pixels by a center. this simulates the blurring of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance blurring: blurring the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to step back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">"blurring: blurring the image through horizontal movements of pixels. this simulates the blurring of a linear moving, z: B: taking photos from a car or train, camera."</seg>
<seg id="619">"blurring blurring: blurs the picture soft in the dark and strong in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow."</seg>
<seg id="620">"sharpness: blurring the image by means of a random shift of pixels, simulating the blurring of an arbitrarily moving camera."</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blurring: find the color basins in the picture and wipes those without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">"mosaic: splits the photo into rectangular cells and then recreates it, through the colt with an average pixel value."</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your picture. this makes it natural to your pictures a wet look. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn copyrighted algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of the drops. as the droplet size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fish eyes changes the visual effect of drops on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">"you can use the & digicode; image processing an area free of raindrops. use the selection tool to choose the area, e.g. a face that will remain free. if you then start the filter regentropfen, the area will stay free of raindrops."</seg>

<seg id="629">Photo inflating is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo at a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">"the big question is, how can you zoom in a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom in an image when the limits of the resolution are reached? how can you recover or guess the missing information? the CImg algorithm used here makes a good job here. try it and you will see it yourself."</seg>
<seg id="631">"if a photo is the wrong size, you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. select transformation size in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog is shown below."</seg>
<seg id="632">"the tool for size change uses a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality, then try the tool for blowing up."</seg>

<seg id="651">"golden center: the golden center is a division that relies on various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus bowl or the flower petals of a sunflower. it appears in all possible things that we feel as beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="652">"the golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks used to construct your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the gold pitch in all times when you put together your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty."</seg>

<seg id="654">The golden center provides smoother relief lines when you put a picture together. these help are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">"the Golden Spiral will bring you good results for your photos. compared to the third-elbow, the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this kind of composition leads the viewer's gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetric visual flow in this way."</seg>
<seg id="656">"a further rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. this rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. this can be a line or different objects."</seg>
<seg id="657">"the golden triangles also divert from the gold spiral discussed above. their vertices are the central points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonic triangles, golden triangles are no equal triangles. diagonal to these lines can be placed dynamic."</seg>
<seg id="658">"if you use gold triangles to break your frame, create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your image focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles."</seg>
<seg id="659">The options Horizontal mirror and vertical mirror can be used to reflect the harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">"with the color button you can set the color of the guides. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the guides can be invisible. in this way you can adjust the color of lines to your current picture."</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">"when you make a photo, it happens easily that you don't keep the camera vertical or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle."</seg>

<seg id="860">"if you intend to edit your images frequently or use them later on, you should not choose the JPEG format since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality is deteriorated. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data."</seg>
<seg id="861">"if you choose JPEG as a storage format, the metadata that is contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG File in the Exif information."</seg>
<seg id="862">"if you have adapted your settings, you can start converting with the trigger button. if you want to break this process again, you can use Cancel."</seg>
<seg id="863">"batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at one time. therefore, use this mode if you are safe, e.g. by testing on a single image which are the best settings."</seg>

<seg id="922">"in this section, you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unique, which is why it is not addressed specifically."</seg>
<seg id="923">"at the bottom of the page you can set up different resolutions for the images. therefore, those who look at your website and have a monitor who supports the maximum resolution 800x600 will not download any more images, for example a resolution of 1600x1200."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time you have specified. so it can search your images with low resolution, which results in a lower transmission time. if it wants to get an image larger, it changes to a higher resolution."</seg>

<seg id="1523">"'--preset extreme -b 256' = 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. requires always 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a song. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality."</seg>
<seg id="1524">"-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate about 11. 128 kbps for all songs of a song. good enough for music of young people, portable devices and autosestools. but not good enough for better hi-fi stereo systems."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be overdone for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size, then choose this setting."</seg>

<seg id="1527">"in connection with coding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoders explain the switches for these programs."</seg>

<seg id="1663">"the optional AllKeysTo M is used to put all the sounds that this instrument needs to attach to the sound with the number M. if your keyboard is not supported for example (GM-Patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with clay 60), which sounds similar to a gun shot. to do this, enter the following in the PATCHMAP:"</seg>
<seg id="1664">"so if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 (gun shot), it takes Patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60 regardless of what tone is in the MIDI file."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"please note that here is meant with the term drum patch of the patch, where each sound represents another percussioning instrument (drum, cymbal, maracas & etc;), and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the same drum (as some keyboard boards have)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to indicate how sounds are displayed on a particular channel or instrument. use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as is the presence. so you have to create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple Keymaps for each channel and each instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are mainly used to map sounds on the percussions channel. see for example the provided Keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to swap the first and second channel, just make it in the CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are more useful for keyboards that have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"if you use the Keymap option, the keymap with the name Name for this channel will be used. if you use the ForcePatch option, all occurrences will be ignored, which will change the patch on this channel. in this case, always patch x is used."</seg>
<seg id="1674">"for example, the ForcePatch option can be useful to always use the percussions patch on the percussions channel."</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for PitchBender Ratio indicates in which ratio Pitch-Bender events are multiplied. if a MIDI file sends a Pitch-Bender event with the value n, it is converted with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then only passed on. the value 4096 is used so that there is no decimal commas in the map file."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting is needed because GM shows that a keyboard, which is supposed to play a pitch-Bender event with the value 4096, will play a tone higher. unfortunately, some keyboards try to play two sounds up to one octave. to find the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"to use a MIDI map, simply open the MIDI Settings dialog."</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboard (one for each MIDI channel). on these pianos you can see which sounds are being played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">"you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel, there is a selection list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the knob does not shine anymore green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used."</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view (up to now) has two different views to display the tones played. view the View menu under the View channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">"the speed LCD shows the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed."</seg>
<seg id="1682">"so if you find a song too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music. it contains the notes, rhythm, speed, & etc; thus, the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices, just like two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while a mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, the speed & etc; you have control over everything."</seg>
<seg id="1685">"this can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) from & kmid; this happens because & kmid; without AWE support has been compiled. to eliminate the problem, you need to download and install a source distribution (for example by kmid; 's home page)"</seg>

<seg id="2054">Please note how the separator supports grouping. someone who does not know my toolbar could believe that the & konqueror; button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar has to be tested by halving all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"if new XML does not exist, it will be created in the root folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the right folder."</seg>
<seg id="2057">"perhaps the most notable extension of & quantaplus, for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language that you like most. therefore, this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use."</seg>
<seg id="2058">"before starting your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; -Repository if someone has done it for you."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"there are two parts in this process. first, you need to search an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; -language. then you need to create the docrc file."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"# KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, to the documentation HTML files e.g. php42 / # elements in the main index Top element = your description for these documentation e.g. & PHP; 4.2 Documentation Section 1 = Section1.html tag 1 = tag1.html tag2 = tag1.html tag 3 = tag.html tag = tag3html"</seg>
<seg id="2061">"the section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, now see the & PHP; documentation something like this:"</seg>
<seg id="2062">"# KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 / PHP 4.2 documentation = table of content, # Getting Started, # Language Reference = basic syntax,... basic syntax = language.basic-syntax.html..."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Notice the # of Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is a subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the depth of boxes (except through reason) mdash; but try it for yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">You note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consequently displayed at the top of the tree view & mdash folder!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces affect nothing but watch & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt; & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"the contents section is the range of the docrc file, which is used for designing context sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP; script the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function is displayed. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file connection lines."</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of separated context elements that should be available (for & PHP; these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can easily save your file docrc to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (as you specified it in your docrc file) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"if you are sure that these are good and worth sharing, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation was used to the & quantaplus; -Repository for use by the & quantaplus; -community. you will not be rich, but proud to have collaborated with the best web development platform."</seg>
<seg id="2070">"with & quantaplus, you are not alone. it is possible to share the separated resources (DTEP packets, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:"</seg>
<seg id="2071">"the resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or else whom. in different places there is an email-sent menu entry, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"the resources can be uploaded to our main archive, from where all the others & quantaplus; users can download them. to add an article to this article, we recommend to sign the resources, for which we need a GPG / PGP key. this ensures the origin of the resources, both for our team and for the later users."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"when uploading, you are asked for your passphrase for your private GPG key (the passphrase will not be saved), or in the event you have multiple keys, you can select one. in the dialog New resource, the input fields must be filled out (URL preview can be empty) and click OK to start uploading."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"uploading can be uploaded from the DTD DTD package (DTEP) menus, upload tool rails, and start in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"after downloading a resource, before installation, examine & quantaplus, the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signature. in case of problems, it warns and it can then be canceled. if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed, a message appears with the indication of the source of the resource."</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work in XML languages which are currently not supported by & quantaplus. the creation can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files could be required in tagXML format. there is the easiest way to convert a DTD into a DTEP package automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can start from the DTD menu and convert a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description that should be used. then the following dialog appears:</seg>

<seg id="2083">"global elements are available for anyone who uses & quantaplus. everything that is selected globally is stored in the common folder structure of & quantaplus. this allows the group of administrators to secure various tool tracks, actions and patterns in the global tree that will then be available to everyone in a multi-user environment."</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">"project-related elements are available only within a specific project. this can be all from & CSS; patterns to toolbars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project. simply said, this is the most limited size. all elements are stored in the project folder tree, which empowers the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project."</seg>
<seg id="2086">"the & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editor window, the tree views, the cartons with information and the toolbars. please beat in, and for further information on these areas."</seg>
<seg id="2087">"you can click the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document, such as close the current, other or all card trailers, reload, deleting or uploading the document, jump to a bookmarks or execution of CVS commands to the current document."</seg>
<seg id="2088">"right-click in the editing area leads to a further context menu related to the edited document content, such as basic editing steps (cut / copy / paste), editing the tags under the mouse cursor, or opening the file if the string is called a file under the mouse cursor."</seg>

<seg id="2093">"a further possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website, etc; all possibilities are open to you."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"templates can be divided into three categories depending on what context they are used. the category depends on the & quantaplus; work area. global templates are always available, local templates only available for the relevant user and templates in projects are only available in the project."</seg>

<seg id="2283">"the program used by me only showed me the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly was changed within these lines. and there were no references to the places where only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a small nightmare."</seg>
<seg id="2284">"this was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could represent differences within one line and changes to white characters. later, a lot of other useful functions have been added."</seg>
<seg id="2285">"for example, if you want to quickly compare text, simply copy it to the clipboard and paste it in one of the comparison window."</seg>
<seg id="2286">One function that made a lot of work was comparing and merging folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a full file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">"also 3-way merging is fully supported. this is useful when two people work independently on one piece of code and make changes. in this editor, you can even edit the result. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:"</seg>

<seg id="2300">"sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to figure out how similar these functions are, it would be a relatively big effort. you would have to create two corresponding files, load them in & kdiff3; then you can simply copy, paste and then compare the relevant sections."</seg>

<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program than cut and paste (instead of copy and paste). in such a case your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"the info line of the source pane contains the characters A, B or C, the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that Windows C is optional.)

<seg id="2349">"when reading a file, it is first passed to this external command. in & kdiff3, then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can use this function, for example, to cut disturbing parts or to correct the indentation."</seg>

<seg id="2351">"the idea behind this is to allow the user more flexibility when setting the diff results. however, an external program is needed and most users do not want to program it themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases, sed or perl is completely sufficient."</seg>

<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several implementations at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the replacements from each other. example:</seg>

<seg id="2359">"note: in rare cases when you use a normal preprocessor, the newline preprocessor sees the output of the normal preprocessor as input."</seg>

<seg id="2948">"you can also use the filter strip to filter after a selected criterion or by entered strings. in the default setting, the list of the log lines is changed automatically, so that only minutes lines are displayed next to the filter. then a Log line will only be displayed if in one of the columns the string of the filter search term is included."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"you can, of course, select another entry at this point. the string of the filter search term is then matched only with entries in the corresponding column."</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a more eye-catching color as protocol lines of the step indication. the color display of protocol lines can be switched off the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">"if you want to display only certain process (e.g. in the system log or in the sync protocol), you can display the process identification (PID) in the process column. this can be useful, for example, if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the samba server. in this case, use filter bar."</seg>

<seg id="2956">"welcome to the & kde; System V Init Editor, more known (and named in the following) as & ksysv; This section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv."</seg>
<seg id="2957">"the system V Init is quickly becoming the standard for controlling program start when you run the system in the & Linux world, because it is easier to use, more powerful and more flexible than traditional BSD init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not mention here further on historical aspects (e.g. because I don't know anything about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the Init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important, because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to System V Init without reinstalling and re-formatting. that's why you need to make sure that the old Init was removed from there, if there was one."</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init also differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc are located directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following other folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">"system services do not include such things such as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things as setserial, which is only started once. such calls include rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"the rc.local should be in / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is not much use for it. you can also create a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run something with the serial port."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel looks init at different places after the program and starts the first one it finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. in the beginning you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point, you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change this, then you can edit / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you have messed up something, then you can repair it by reboot the system and run the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it start all the correct scripts? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d, you'll probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">"you will notice that there are no right files in this folder. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory."</seg>
<seg id="2968">How starts and stops init system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument as start and stop. you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and when a K contains, the script will run with the argument stop. if it includes an S, the script will be called with the argument start."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could have & eg; a server runlevel that only runs httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc; also, I could also have a user runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc; starts."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you will learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer is simple to not trivial. simply drag an entry in the range of available system services to one of the six runlevel to start (or stop it) at this level.</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between runleveling or change the position within a level by moving it somewhere else. this will not only happen if you remove an entry from the range of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries will be moved when you move them into a new area. to simply copy them to a new runlevel, you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to add the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">"note: at present, there is no way to restore entries thrown into the trash. so be careful."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the Tab key to activate the various working areas (available system services, runlevel 1 start, runlevel 1 stop & etc;) and the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move an entry into another runlevel, move it to the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and paste it into the desired runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually, press the entry button to change the properties dialog. use the Tab key to change the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu will require confirmation before executing them."</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. Preferences are recovered from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise they will be recovered from & ksysv; otherwise they will be saved in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
