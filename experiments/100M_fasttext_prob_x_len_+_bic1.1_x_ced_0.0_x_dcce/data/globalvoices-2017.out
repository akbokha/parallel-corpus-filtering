&quot; although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extraordinary .
&quot; like many of my generation I grew up with American movies , I danced to American music , read American authors and run his sport . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly a journalist because of an American movie . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Peli@@ can Let@@ ter , a fear@@ less re@@ porter who wanted to fill the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil @-@ magnet as a Jura @-@ student , who wanted to occupy the supreme federal court with judges who were interested in his interest . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free after Method Man , &quot; I was as if this is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the USA had only intensified . &quot;
&quot; I always said , &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so welcoming , that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I even had a very black@@ ish love letter written about its size .
then Donald Tru@@ mp came .
much has been written about x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
with his opinion he never thinks behind the mountain as one says so beautifully .
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks , like a former colleague expressing it , and declares publicly his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , African American and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the people responded to his statements and tuned in dro@@ ves for him . &quot;
the 13 million votes he won with the Republi@@ can elections was the highest number ever reached by a candidate nominated by the party .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
&quot; who are the Americans , who support this big@@ ot@@ ger person , I asked myself ? &quot;
I couldn &apos;t reconci@@ le Tru@@ mp and his voters with the people I met in Phoenix during my time .
&quot; like my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program that takes up people from around the world , a deeply believing man with whom I was able to talk about Islam and his past . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s view of the world did not agree with that of Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati Inqu@@ ir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met at our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
&quot; Tru@@ mp@@ s In@@ tolerance is also in stark contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who have been fighting the environment for their lives , and their husband Dave , my host family who treated me like their son . &quot;
&quot; she still fits the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and my colleagues helped to get used to the complexity of American life . &quot;
&quot; then there were Andrew treats , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career . &quot;
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
&quot; while Tru@@ mp cau@@ tioned his way to the nom@@ inees republi@@ can presidential candidate , they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on November 8 , 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly white , pres@@ ided over a man despite - or perhaps just because of his contemp@@ t against non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Tru@@ mp , because they shared either his racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , I almost broke my heart . &quot;
perhaps it is unfair to design@@ ate the Tru@@ mp voters as ra@@ cists .
&quot; to categ@@ ori@@ ze people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot;
this is superficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful and suggests an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
&quot; could it be that those voters , of whom the majority are white , voted for Tru@@ mp , because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they might say that they are still important in this America ? &quot;
maybe . maybe .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comments the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down on those who look different than he . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; &quot; whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; ( Ü ) . : according to the wh@@ ites against all other ethnic groups . &quot; &quot; white and Whi@@ pl@@ ash &quot; &quot; white and whi@@ pl@@ ash , as the big van Jones named , has killed exactly what America has made so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which belief or background one may always have , America welcomes everyone . &quot;
&quot; for this land chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan man whose history , as he himself says , would not be possible anywhere else in the world . &quot;
&quot; with the election Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s , however , a huge part of the White America promises this promise and says : to hell with multip@@ licity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is back at the helm , they say . &quot;
&quot; all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
&quot; on a rally for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot;
the crowd responded with a loud &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; do Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared .
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they cried , and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot;
&quot; if someone , who is not like you , would have a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and vocal &quot; NO &quot; !
&quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tru@@ mp , this is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the land , for whom his son had fallen , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now Tru@@ mp@@ s Land , the news said . &quot;
&quot; all the people who look like Mr. Khan , couldn &apos;t find any place in this new America . &quot;
and that breaks my heart .

out of the misery for the stars : these Latin American children cannot spoil their love for music by rub@@ b@@ ish
&quot; the &quot; Recycl@@ ed Instruments Orchestra &quot; by C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC . &quot;

what did the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero commune in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca together with the children of the Paragu@@ a@@ an city of C@@ ate@@ ura ?
&quot; the music played in both places not only changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the tr@@ ash
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill , only 16 kilometres south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; an old colonial town that is very popular among tourists , but worlds away from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; for several years now , La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( music ban@@ de ) has been playing in the community : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way of overcoming poverty with their musical instruments . &quot;
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest in the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the community , located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for its abuse of drugs and gangs of gangs . &quot;
but this changed after a chance meeting with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered the youth a rare hope for hope .
&quot; the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI : &quot;
&quot; as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion . &quot;
&quot; you always come laugh@@ ing and play with shiny eyes and play in the hu@@ stle you learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , bon@@ gos and the con@@ ga . &quot;
music from rub@@ b@@ ish
&quot; more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village located at the top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with re@@ manufactured instruments made of local solid waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycl@@ er under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez began to transform parts of the waste into instruments . &quot;
&quot; instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double bass , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and drums all made out of the tr@@ ash . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music , as well as music from the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article by the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , recalls : &quot;
first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach in the same place where the parents worked in the tr@@ ash . children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live together with their children .
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something which he had never seen before : a violin rendered from apost@@ asy .
&quot; today , there is a whole orchestra playing on instruments made of recycled material and which is called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra . &quot;
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) records the musical performance :
the world generates about one billion tons of waste each year .
&quot; those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est - like the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring drama from tr@@ ash to music around the world .
the orchestra has played his music even before Pope Francis :
these East African countries demonstrate how technology and team@@ work can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that comb@@ ats wild illegal fishing .
&quot; this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine reported specifically about international , practical solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
the re @-@ release takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for the common use of content .
&quot; in West Africa , it was known at that time that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberia before it visited the other coast of Africa . &quot;
&quot; the East African countries were , accordingly , upset and inclined to welcome a criminal offen@@ ders of this kind at their coasts . &quot;
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Mozambique and the Seychelles were quickly mobili@@ zing against the ship . they refused to buy one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permit . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that just refused everything , &quot; &quot; recalls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior management of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority . he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at that time . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch fish there . &quot;
&quot; finally , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars in Liberia , because of pil@@ lage of the country &apos;s fish stocks . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 launched by N@@ RO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal fishing ) . &quot;
&quot; apart from Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries that the premi@@ er had driven out of their waters at that time . &quot;
&quot; &quot; with this , we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and work together . they exchange information and stand up to each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , director of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project provides F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , hence it is extremely difficult to detect . thus , illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing in regions . &quot;
the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected can harm the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance .
&quot; while actions against illegal fishing were once ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also through the sn@@ ail @-@ tempo , with the information between individual countries , the actions are happening in real time , with tra@@ ck@@ able at F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; there , for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news about suspi@@ cious activities or details that were noticed or experienced during a harbour inspection . &quot;
fish @-@ i is also very attentive to the activities of ships when they move on the open seas by means of satellite data .
&quot; this allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in forbidden areas . also , suspi@@ cious routes may be detected - such as those indicating that a ship loads its caught fish on the way to other ships . &quot;
&quot; ideally , such investigations can indicate whether the participating vessels have a fishing license where they were on the road and possibly whether they have a pen@@ al code . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of this information , countries that are opposed to illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such vessels in their ports , which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay sanctions , as in the case of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is not profitable anymore . &quot;
&quot; this is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , senior director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm engaged in the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the already mentioned platform was created to recover estimated 20 million USD to lost revenue , which the eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network lost every year because of the illegal fishermen entering East African waters . &quot;
&quot; East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish@@ eries , which attracts the region &apos;s commercial fishing from around the world . among these are also illegal fishermen . &quot;
&quot; their practices include like sailing under false flag , fake license papers , speci@@ fying fantasy names , fishing @-@ protected species and fishing in nature reserves . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately exploit the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of an un@@ broken @-@ organised control system , &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; in the past , a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could then say &apos; You cannot run my port &apos; . &quot;
but another country could say &quot; Come to me . &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i .
&quot; until now , the closed front is working . &quot;
&quot; since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i has participated in more than 30 studies of suspected ships . &quot;
it has exposed criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has pursued and found fle@@ eting ships .
&quot; as a result of his cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to combat crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing over large distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
it builds a system that will help F@@ ISH @-@ i to locate suspi@@ cious ships more precisely .

&quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly evolving , also helps to track down the illegal ships that would like to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; illegal f@@ ishers use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO , which also deals with fisher@@ y data and provides technical support with F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships switch off their automatic identification systems , for example , so they can no longer be ordered from satellites . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Cop@@ eland helps build a system that connects different levels of information . F@@ ISH @-@ i aims to help you find criminals operating with greater precision . &quot;
a model program
but can F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the Sky@@ Truth , believes that . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Marine Protection Organization Oce@@ ana : a platform that offers satellite data and means that each tra@@ ck@@ able ship &apos;s position can be displayed worldwide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; get together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing - that simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here &apos;s a chance for countries to unite and bundle their resources to study . &quot;
&quot; we should do this on a global scale . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust has a similar project in which a global system allows the prosecution of ships . &quot;
&quot; there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect criminals , but also sc@@ are them off . &quot;
&quot; ships that had previously been confis@@ cated without a license and hardly had to reck@@ on with consequences , now know that they are being watched . &quot;
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ ISH trade now have a 33 % increase in fishing turnover since fishing boats buy more lic@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped to track Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found smu@@ gg@@ ler nets where they were banned . &quot;
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that now other countries are copying us , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we are an object of study . &quot; &quot; in West Africa several hundred million dollars disappear every year through illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , six countries joined together , the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they also fight against illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; Security is the goal of even more such initiatives and structures to be created in other regions , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s latest member state Somalia has recently announced his first major triumph : in October , Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was traveling under false flag . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also inv@@ aded into forbidden waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 set a strong sign that they are against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time proof that such a special , collaborative approach to protecting the oceans really works across the world sea . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London . &quot;
&quot; their articles appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela escal@@ ates further : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of &quot; capturing the country &quot; &quot;

they act as a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the im@@ pe@@ achment of the President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

&quot; after the government of Venezuela rejected the application of the opposition to a referendum on im@@ pe@@ achment , Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into empt@@ iness by gathering in the streets . &quot;
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( e.g. : the re@@ inv@@ ading Venezuela ) both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found .
&quot; the debate will also be held in other parts of the country , including in the Bar@@ inas flat land , in the An@@ des Region Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ chir@@ a , in the central @-@ north @-@ located Bun@@ de@@ state Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the political and economic situation in the country is worsen@@ ing continuously , which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medication . &quot;
&quot; many representatives of the opposition saw in the im@@ pe@@ achment of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro the chance of a fundamental change , but in the end the holding of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , contribut@@ or at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summ@@ arises in her latest article the context of the government decision as follows : &quot;
&quot; in the context of the social , political and economic crisis in which inflation and violence are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % at the end of the year ) and in which a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine exists , the referendum on im@@ pe@@ achment constituted the opportunity to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance . &quot;
&quot; the electoral alliance of Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ á@@ tica or briefly MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic Union ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups joined together , called for a mass rally to support the National Assembly . &quot;
&quot; the call was commented on Twitter , among other things , as follows : &quot;

&quot; the first demonstration in the framework of the Action Program &quot; &quot; The Recon@@ quest of Venezuela &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday 26 October . &quot;
&quot; the pictures of the mar@@ ches published in real time testify among other things an overwhelming participation of the people in numerous areas of the country , but also confron@@ tations with polic@@ emen and supporters of the government . &quot;
one of the most commonly shared pictures shows a prot@@ esters calling through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; will you kill me because I am hungry ? &quot;

&quot; on Twitter , pictures that talk about disputes , as well as reports of oppression and abuse . &quot;
especially large waves struck the news about police repression in the centrally located city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
&quot; there , the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves from the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government according to their own statement . &quot;
&quot; hours later , they were able to leave the cathedral safely again , but the protests continued . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an State of T@@ á@@ chir@@ a : &quot;
&quot; the women in T@@ á@@ chir@@ a do not wear tubes , because otherwise you could see something that many national gar@@ den@@ ers do not have ! &quot;
meanwhile an inf@@ ographic makes the round that forms the amount of repression per day :
thus the dictatorship op@@ presses the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a minist@@ erial decree - it has now been proven in the eyes of many people by the presence of countless people on the streets .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Lab@@ s :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado state that 1 % of sign@@ atures are forged .
here is your im@@ pe@@ achment !
on the road !
&quot; others evaluate these protests as a further step in the fight against a government , which has taken little against the disa@@ strous economic crisis and has preferred to stop critical voices : &quot;
they took us so much - but also the fear !
mar@@ ches tend to increase in frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media they were too hungry to participate in a strike instead of working or shopping .

&quot; this is an adaptation of an interview of Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 at D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ ine@@ an news site . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to take part in the atro@@ cities of La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine@@ an city of Córdoba . &quot;
&quot; as a grown @-@ up man , Qui@@ j@@ ano said now in the context of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process in the province of Córdoba , against his father . &quot;
&quot; the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , was subjected to crimes committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not choose his life .
&quot; beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough . &quot;
for 34 years he kept family secrets for himself .
&quot; in the situation at that time , I thought it was ok . &quot;
I felt like a secret .
&quot; as a child of 15 years , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father . &quot;
&quot; at that time I could not see that my father was a th@@ ief , tor@@ turer and mur@@ derer . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was Gen@@ dar@@ meri@@ e@@ hrer . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was Deputy Commander of the Intelligence Department 141 in La Per@@ la prison . &quot;

&quot; but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor , who is accused of ab@@ duction in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ an@@ os son , a man who , over the years , recognized the extent of atro@@ cities he had experienced as a boy , and who testified before a federal court against his own father . &quot;
his story shows what great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose for himself a way of salvation .
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; when my father began to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall with us . there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts . &quot;
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
&quot; you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have made friends with one of the ERP . &quot;
don &apos;t forget that they will not be kidn@@ apped one day and I have to save you .
&quot; the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the revolutionary Workers &quot; Party of Argentina . &quot;
that is why he for@@ ba@@ de me to go back to the sports hall again . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me I would be a secret agent .
&quot; I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine , because my father had educated myself . &quot;
&quot; at the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard the det@@ ain@@ ees . &quot;
&quot; these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda materials , books , simple everything . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; then the prisoners are tortured &quot; &quot; &quot;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la - everything in 1976 .
the first and last time he was waiting for me at the entrance in the car .
&quot; when he took me for the second time , he ordered me to get off . he led me to a bar@@ rack , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - just everything possible . &quot;
everything was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a small pack@@ et wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to wear it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a great l@@ ump of silver . &quot;
&quot; on that day I went to the other end of the barracks , where the stolen items were removed and kept me with a guard . &quot;
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tortured .
I pe@@ ened in and saw a couch where people were tortured .
it looked like a b@@ unk@@ bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they attached it to the end of a cable . the other end was fast@@ ened to the body of the person who was just en@@ gros@@ sed there .
&quot; they un@@ le@@ ashed a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , poured it with water and ch@@ ased him a load of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the sten@@ ch there was horri@@ fic ... like a dirty wind .
&quot; years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room . &quot;
I immediately recognized the smell and I realized that this is the smell of a body in need .
I never forgot this od@@ our .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a person can do so much suffering to another ?
I knew these people were killed
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and bore ey@@ eli@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; he spoke to &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian who was also indic@@ ted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people lay down with the face down@@ wards - all were captiv@@ ated by hands and feet . &quot;
&quot; in the vicinity of the entrance , people were lying calm@@ ly on the matt@@ resses . &quot;
&quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; What do you look like , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot;
&quot; I replied , &quot; Why did you bring me anywhere else ? &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told me about it at home .
&quot; in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero clas@@ hed and killed a man there .
&quot; according to the survi@@ vor of the survi@@ vor , Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also accused of the La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial , was sentenced to death by the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , director of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers . &quot;
the way you came in here is also the way on which the hi@@ res came here .
&quot; when you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and were then tortured for the first time . &quot;
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ isation .
&quot; when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came to be laid . &quot;
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of people and the disappearance of their corp@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; spo@@ ils &apos; of war
my father brought home all kinds of stolen things .
at that time I had no idea what the &quot; spo@@ ils &quot; - as they called - was .
&quot; but when I was in the military later , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - I realized that war spo@@ ils are a bay@@ on@@ et or maybe military in@@ signia which one takes off an enemy that is fought against . &quot;

&quot; but if one goes to a house and the refrigerator , the record player , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then that is not war money but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
that is theft .
&quot; I always wondered how my father , the leader of the security forces , was able to take part in this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I just don &apos;t understand it .
I was also an officer in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
once he called me a criminal and I replied : &quot; and you who steal cars on the road ?
you are not a criminal ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded in rage , struck me and shou@@ ted , &quot;
&quot; when you go so far , I will find you and kill yourself . &quot;
we don &apos;t need anyone else to do that !
that is how my father was .
I don &apos;t have a single good memory of him .
&quot; as I said in the process , I showed a photo of back then , on which I wore a jacket and a tur@@ t@@ len@@ eck jum@@ per made of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but nevertheless he brought clothing home . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the defense accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator of this crime . I replied , no problem , they can lay me a burden on what they wanted . &quot;
I was there anyway to testify .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the disappearance of the corp@@ se is the last abom@@ in@@ able act &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now , where I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; I have children . once you have children , one recognizes the value of a life . &quot;
one develops further and real@@ ises that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; well , you have executed people during the dictatorship . but why leave the corp@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
why children kidn@@ ap ?
&quot; one day , my father brought a girl home , whose mother had been killed . &quot;
&quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I always asked myself : they were tortured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
you could have just put them in jail .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why would their bodies disappear ?
did these people not also have families with whom one could hand over their mort@@ al remains ?
the disappearance of the corp@@ se is the last abom@@ in@@ able act that one can do to a man .
&quot; my father told me when democracy was re@@ introduced , they picked up machines to remove the mort@@ al rem@@ nants of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were crushed and dispos@@ ed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; my father said . &quot;
&quot; but , of course , something remains forever . &quot;
I &apos;ve seen how you killed people !
only to clarify it : I have nothing against the military .
I was even myself at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
&quot; I just said the truth about 20 criminals , including my father . &quot;
the thought of seeing my father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I made him alleg@@ ations of all the cru@@ el@@ ty that I had to witness with him .
&quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anybody . &quot;
&quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly rejected and asked myself what all the exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and &quot; &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; , &quot; which they supposedly defended , were actually good . &quot;
then I cried out :
how can you tell me something ?
I &apos;ve seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you have forced me as a child to participate .
he replied only &quot; Well then show me up . &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 I made the first advertisement .
I had finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can repro@@ ach me that I am bi@@ ased . I have finally told my own father .
&quot; Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died under house arrest in May 2015 , still before the end of the trial . &quot;
&quot; charged with 4@@ 16 crimes , including severe , un@@ lawful de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 cases , torture with subsequent death in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of a child under 10 years old . &quot;

the judgments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; the term &quot; &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; refers to the size of the sentence in Spanish . &quot;
&quot; after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial ended due to the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August . &quot;
&quot; 43 oppres@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases , the Court suspended prison sentences and in nine cases sentences ranging from 2 to 14 years . in six cases , there were acqu@@ itt@@ als . &quot;
eleven of the 54 defend@@ ants initially died during the trial .
&quot; # La@@ Per@@ la@@ ken : murder , torture and rape by officers . &quot;
&quot; all defend@@ ants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police personnel and civilian personnel . &quot;
Pier@@ o De Monti was kidn@@ apped along with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the silent chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
the Court of Justice is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who worked for years on justice for the victims .
&quot; Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the attorney of the Argent@@ inian organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , established in 1995 , who represents the children of people who were murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said : &quot;
&quot; the process lasted more than three years , but the research was 39 years . &quot;
&quot; in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government handed over the country on which La Per@@ la was located so that a memorial site could be erected there , which is now run by human rights organisations . &quot;

&quot; translation errors makes elderly people in Kyoto &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the sign with the translation error at a center in Kyoto , where you can extend your driver &apos;s license . &quot;
the photo was spread in the social media .
edit the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened center in which one can pro@@ long its driving license , last month witnessed a particularly dis@@ mis@@ sive translation . &quot;
&quot; in a sign , the Japanese word &quot; &quot; ( kor@@ eg@@ below sha ) , which means &quot; &quot; older mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; wrong@@ ly - but perhaps also with evil h@@ ind thought &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; as &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; translated . &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
&quot; editing of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which has been widely shared in the social media . &quot;
&quot; the error was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers . &quot;
&quot; the Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n , which is published in Kyoto , wrote : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an insul@@ t to older people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot;
&quot; the incorrect English translation was first removed . the designation &quot; terrible drivers &quot; was later replaced by the appropriate , although gram@@ mati@@ cally not quite correct name &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the police of the Kyoto Pre@@ f@@ ecture ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for correctness before it was published . &quot;
a blo@@ gger reported as follows on the ap@@ ology :
&quot; we are sincer@@ ely sorry that elderly people felt insul@@ ted by the inadequate correction ( translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News has dealt a bit more extensively with the phenomenon of the &quot; terrible &quot; elderly drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful &quot; &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the share of older drivers who have been involved in accidents across the country is quite an occasion for concern . &quot;
&quot; in Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of 19,@@ 460 deaths were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 . this corresponds to a share of 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors created 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
this increased their share to 17.@@ 7 % .
&quot; while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has risen during the same period . &quot;
the so @-@ called re@@ porter brought comments to the light published in the article published on Yahoo which show which prejudi@@ ces some Japanese seem to have against older drivers :
&quot; among other things , the article on the translation error received the following comments : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; is this ( &quot; &quot; horrible mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; ) not the reality ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; So er@@ ron@@ eous is the translation really not , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a true translation error . &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so common throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre mistakes in English .

the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold .
&quot; to translate , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the source text and active language skills to translate it into the target language . &quot;
&quot; the latter demands the active domination of the target language - something that is the case in native speakers . generally , the conviction that translators in the target language should not be in the initial language - native speakers . &quot;
&quot; for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ user Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as their mother tongue , who could make translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost @-@ reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies that don &apos;t have foreign employees can still make translations in @-@ house . then , the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is best assessed , is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ user Karl Baron .
machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results .
&quot; the confused and en@@ ig@@ matic sentences , which arise through machine translation , show that this technique cannot replace a human translator for a long time . this applies to some languages very special . &quot;
&quot; some of the stran@@ gest English phrases in Japan , including pu@@ zz@@ ling prints that often decorate t @-@ shirts or bags , are used only for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or even understood . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ user Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry . however , from large companies or government who have the means to ensure higher standards , it is possible to expect more careful translations . &quot;
&quot; in the future , the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for its translations . &quot;
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship measures on the Internet and on TV
&quot; main page of the &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; portal ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , 7 April , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they would not have access to the Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay online channel . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that the websites of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ oli@@ o TV are no longer accessible . &quot;
&quot; other online broad@@ cast@@ ers also presented photos of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , which were organized by opposition groups that opposed the government Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros . &quot;
&quot; the protests began at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dissolved parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author of Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a trac@@ er . &quot;
# C@@ ens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages of Venezuela are closed again .
this is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
&quot; offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with the Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; traditional media have been hes@@ it@@ ant since 2014 when reporting about protests . at that time , the Commission threatened them with fin@@ es and closures when they continued to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call to violence . &quot; &quot;
without cable TV and informative national television channels I signed up again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
&quot; surprisingly , that it is still cheaper than buying two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fo later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . &quot;
&quot; previous research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local Internet providers occasionally use DNS . &quot;
&quot; if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server responds fla@@ wed or denied the request when you call such a website . &quot;
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v ; @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
&quot; at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , the broadcast was stopped on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ PI@@ TV cam@@ er@@ aman El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who carried the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was taken into custody . &quot;
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in police custody .
&quot; eight hours later , he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on stream again . &quot;
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government has also reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections : thus the Venezu@@ el@@ ans access to multimedia reporting on current events in the country are becoming more difficult . &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to receive education &quot;
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a cri@@ adi@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
&quot; today , T@@ ina fights for the rights of children and g@@ athers testimony of other Cri@@ mean tas which have been victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;

the following article is the shortened version of a report published by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors .
&quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en , &quot; edited and re @-@ published by Global Vo@@ ices of Latin America . &quot;
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
&quot; shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot;
&quot; the one who has become something , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
but T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old , she started working as Cri@@ mean for the family . in Paraguay the more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a big family with little money gives her under@@ age son or her minor daughter to another , more plentiful family . in exchange , the child gets food , training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; however , what is not mentioned is that the children have to pay countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can be - and all that within the framework of a contract that one cannot lift up . &quot;
this practice referred to as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organizations .
&quot; after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; she talked to Cri@@ mean tas , especially young girls affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , researched and den@@ ounced . &quot;
&quot; she tried to call things by name , because the feeling of gratitude that is ino@@ cul@@ ated by the Cri@@ mean is generally silent . &quot;
&quot; Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family , who has their daughter in believing that they will complete their education , improve their position in society and &quot; make something out of themselves &quot; can be handed over to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family who takes up the girl with them and justi@@ fies their exploitation with the belief that they give someone a chance that would otherwise not be educated and perhaps even star@@ ved . &quot;
victims of the Cri@@ mean az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will learn about it many years later . &quot;
sometimes they never experience it .
&quot; in January 2016 , the so far unknown phenomenon took place , which takes place in the hidden in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed signs of violent blows . shortly after she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
it was Cri@@ mean in the household of the former military staff of Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo who worked as an official at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt .
&quot; Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ rei@@ ra hit Mar@@ ín as long as she suffered fatal injuries . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
&quot; a few days later , the media reported the incident . &quot;
they stressed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ mean .
organizations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela held the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go &apos;s death deep within the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society for the death of the girl .
they referred the Cri@@ mean az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people gathered to protest demonstrations and demanded that there &quot; no more Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; more cows are registered in Paraguay as children , &quot; &quot; lam@@ ented T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children . &quot;
without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the married couple and almost 60 civil society organisations demanded swift examination of the case .
they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was their Cri@@ mean .
&quot; if the case occurs in court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín might be landmark , when for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go arrives in court . &quot;
the Every@@ day of a Cri@@ mean
&quot; Cri@@ mean tas are not only exploited as workers , they also live isolated from other girls at their age . &quot;
&quot; T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , where her father worked , had to sign up bankrupt@@ cy and her father lost his work . &quot;
their brothers had to work all the time and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to make money .
but they all went further to school .
only T@@ ina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón as Cri@@ mean .
&quot; in the house of her employer , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , she had to divide the time in such a way that she was still time to learn . &quot;
she rose every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared breakfast for her employer .
&quot; for example , she clean@@ sed the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor . &quot;
&quot; when the school was over , she went home again and had time to learn . &quot;
&quot; the sooner it was finished with learning , the more free time she had . &quot;
but even this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but also did not get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the library of the landlord than eating out of the fridge , &quot; she re@@ members . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iser of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party which was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; on some evenings , the host Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced to stand alongside him and read leading articles such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot; &quot;
he tried to convince them not to believe in the reports of the official media about the regime of the dict@@ ator .
&quot; he considered her intelligent , but did not stay with her . &quot; the landlord had found someone who listened while he talked about politics , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they allowed me not often to visit my family because they thought that I would &quot; &quot; learn bad habits &quot; &quot; there again . &quot;
&quot; their Lord feared that they would lose the education they allowed her to lose , she explains . &quot;
but you were fully aware that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work .
&quot; in school , too , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; one thing that is almost never spoken are bul@@ lying and har@@ ass@@ ment exposed to Cri@@ mean &apos;s when they go to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children parents have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is Cri@@ mean . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone home . I didn &apos;t have a circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood .
&quot; in my youth , in the time when friend@@ ships emerge , I feel particularly clear that I belong to no group . &quot;
&quot; the isolation was the worst of everything , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
the society appro@@ ves the Cri@@ mean az@@ go
&quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share job advertisements for cleaning staff and children &apos;s girls in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; the group administration is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a municipal coun@@ cill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ ón district . &quot;

bill prescri@@ bes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

&quot; sixty Egyptian parliam@@ ent@@ arians have recently agreed to draft legislation on &quot; &quot; regulating the use and benefits of social networks &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when it is accepted by the Parliament , users of social media in Egypt must be registered with a government authority in order to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a place would then be set up to give citizens permission to use social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months with the adoption of the law , users must register on the site of the site with their proper names and identity card numbers to be able to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; if this fails to do so , it could bring a penalty of up to six months in prison or a financial penalty . &quot;
&quot; the bill consisting of six paragra@@ phs and cur@@ ses in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that runs through the Internet and is used to communicate with others through voice , video surveillance and text . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities can impose its registration on users who do not register considering the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation on the level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , Parliament @-@ approved and suppor@@ ter of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users who received a username and password from the telecommunications ministry to get through the fire@@ wall blocking Facebook . &quot;
&quot; this could mean that Egypt is planning to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . because of those , it would be necessary for Egyptians to file information about their identity in order to access the network . &quot;
but it is not known until now that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; conducting research techn@@ ologist &quot; ) at the Egyptian Initiative for Human Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; ) , said Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things related to technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine that just like they could viol@@ ently control physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; if I take them seriously , it means they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who seek permission or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to bring them to a court process . &quot;
&quot; this is technically not realistic , but everything is possible in Egypt . &quot;
&quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the Legisl@@ ative Assembly and the Constitutional Committ@@ ees before it enters the plenary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether his acceptance and enforcement succeed or not , the design &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in parliament , in whose sense control is maxim@@ ized and ensured that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration is present on the screen , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , the MP T@@ amer El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed legislation against cy@@ ber crime in which a life imprisonment for those found guilty of threatening the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; encouraging protest . &quot; &quot;

&quot; this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was published in the original at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions . &quot;
&quot; high up in the mountains of Kurdist@@ an in the north east of Iraq , the animal conserv@@ ation@@ ist H@@ ana Ahmed Raz@@ a and her team of scientists of the NGO Nature Iraq are working to protect the ghost@@ ly Per@@ si@@ can le@@ op@@ ards . &quot;
&quot; a sub@@ species of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards , which ro@@ ams through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature . &quot;
why is this particular le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; as Raz@@ a appeared in the video , &quot; the Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining predat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; and the health and the flour@@ ishing of the ecosystem also depends on a large predat@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard actually in the wild bo@@ bs@@ lei@@ gh is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video therefore states that they have a picture of a big cat in the camera , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy . &quot;
&quot; as a trained bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a passion@@ ately likes to show another side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict . &quot;
it has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years .
since 2013 she has been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and is committed to ensuring that protection zones for wildlife in the Kurdist@@ an region are set up .

&quot; in early March 2017 , the daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , the daily newspaper K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , has documented the progress made in the last six years in order to rebuild the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which is located in the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was a state pre@@ f@@ ecture in Japan &apos;s northeast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the ts@@ un@@ ami . &quot;
&quot; hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring det@@ ectiv@@ es Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to evacu@@ ate , as the ts@@ un@@ ami had left whole coastal cities disappear from the map . &quot;
&quot; the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture has yet experienced a nuclear accident , which is why 160@@ ,000 inhabitants had to leave their homes . &quot;
&quot; the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows , from a local point of view , what progress has been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the lives of local residents . &quot;
the detailed report of the newspaper covers both the statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority and the survey results of the affected persons themselves .
&quot; the apartment building in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of planned replacement buildings ( that , &quot; Sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to register the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , and 80 percent of the planned replacement buildings were completed . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such buildings , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma represents 70 percent of the final light . &quot;
&quot; however , even six years after the disaster , it is still hard to reloc@@ ate evacu@@ ated shel@@ ters from Beh@@ el shel@@ ters ( the &quot; &quot; kas@@ ets@@ u ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u &quot; &quot; ) into final spar@@ es . &quot;
&quot; after the triple catastrophe , nearly 80@@ ,000 people saw themselves forced to live in shel@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 , more and more 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such homes . &quot;
&quot; almost 40 percent of the evacu@@ ated Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma evacu@@ ated in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful here . more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ated evacu@@ ated homes were res@@ ett@@ led to final homes . &quot;
&quot; for I@@ w@@ ate , the number is here at 34 percent . &quot;
the state of work and everyday life in the three concerned pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
&quot; like the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools affected by mis@@ fortune have opened their doors until December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures schools . &quot;
&quot; six years later , industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult . &quot;
&quot; while nearly 100 per cent of the fishing har@@ bours in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of the fishing har@@ bours have resum@@ ed their operations in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
ts@@ un@@ ami and nuclear accident have affected agricultural land in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agr@@ arian land .
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of agricultural land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 per cent destroyed agricultural land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that this is just a consequence of nuclear accident , as only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed agricultural land of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , are located in the &quot; nuclear proliferation zone . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered largely , but Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains unbe@@ aten here as well . &quot;
&quot; the tourist figures in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again 90 percent on the same stand , as before the mis@@ fortune . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can show only 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe nearly half of the inhabitants of the coast , it is more difficult to earn their livel@@ ihood . &quot;
is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
&quot; in order to obtain a complete picture , the paper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacu@@ ated countries . &quot;
&quot; in her introduction to the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains : &quot;
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey in order to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the indigenous population .
survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to prepare for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
&quot; however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of those surv@@ eyed still do not have enough in cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es prevention . &quot;
how it is about those who had to be evacu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture
&quot; in its edition commemor@@ ating the anniversary of the earthquake , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung emphas@@ ised its attention to the situation of the Ev@@ acu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had not only had to witness the massive earthquake and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture was also witness to the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed . &quot;
&quot; from 160 000 Ev@@ acu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , nearly 63 000 people were transferred to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 some more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , had been res@@ ett@@ led into permanent replacement houses . &quot;
&quot; as of 2017 , there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside of their pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; most of the evacu@@ ated areas still in Beh@@ el shel@@ ters are older than 50 years old . it is known that the efforts to rebuild Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma will have to compete with massive construction projects . &quot;
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; when people meet people from other countries speaking another language , the differences seem to be larger than the simil@@ arities . &quot;
&quot; after a while , however , one often recognizes that one more connects it than it seems at first sight . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our prospects and remind us that the world is ultimately very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , we look at these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast , we deal with topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve . &quot;
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment when they felt very strongly connected to someone over language and country borders .
&quot; Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ kon@@ i speaks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ man explains how a hike has consolidated their affection for Iranian culture .

&quot; a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week : last Friday , a police officer struck him with a head against the head during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia . nationwide , millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march against austerity measures . &quot;
&quot; Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who studies social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures . &quot;
doctors operated on this Saturday and now transferred him to an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus who spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
&quot; after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás noted that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended from active service until the end of the investigation . &quot;
the pictures show the police officer how he hits the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
&quot; if a police officer was beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and landed on the intensive care unit , his face would be seen on television for six months and the entire repression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video taken by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z on the net in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ edi@@ cs briefly rush to it . &quot;
&quot; another video with the same scenes , but filmed from another perspective , has also appeared in social networks . &quot;
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , living in another state , Internet users have now donated 10,000 Brazilian rel@@ ays ( approximately 2,@@ 700 Euro ) to cover a part of the cost of medical treatment and to enable his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ ana while he is hospit@@ alized . &quot;

&quot; on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado is calling for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás : &quot;
&quot; Go@@ i@@ ás is experiencing a wave of political violence : here the activ@@ ist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish was assass@@ inated by his father , because he was involved in the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . now we have the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who was on the intensive care unit after being attacked by a police officer who hit him with a head@@ stock . &quot;
police en@@ cro@@ ach@@ ments
&quot; &quot; &quot; Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil , where there was brutal police operations against demonstr@@ ators last Friday . &quot;
&quot; polic@@ emen were at protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a stage for speakers , rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas . &quot;
&quot; member Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to ren@@ ounce violence against demonstr@@ ators via loudspeaker announcements . &quot;
&quot; this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers nationwide . &quot;
&quot; once again Brazilian media have covered road protests by focusing on another , unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window pane . &quot;
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo deliberately reported a broken glass window to illustr@@ atively design their title pages with a photo .
&quot; on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a bus set on fire . &quot;
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window @-@ window than about the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special cause .
this must also be recognised if you are strictly against any form of material damage .
&quot; here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; gets an absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate meaning , and the typical acts of the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title of &quot; prot@@ esters on confrontation course with the police . &quot; &quot;
villages forgotten by the de@@ indu@@ str@@ alization in Cuba
&quot; with the introduction of the Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso Law , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in all Cuba closed doors ( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta ) &quot;
&quot; Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , which is located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ then , is generally known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - not@@ withstanding the fact that there is no significant sugar harvest on site . &quot;
it is two years ago when the activities were paraly@@ sed in the sugar cane factories .
&quot; after the war , the sugar cane industry remained silent in the region , and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of steel and concrete remained . &quot;
about 27@@ 2 workers had to inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the work .
others res@@ igned and comm@@ utes to the factories every day .
&quot; N@@ ene , a veter@@ an veter@@ an who rises every day at 4 : 00 am , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ bs his sleep . &quot;
he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region that after a long in@@ active time are back in operation because they have been preserved .
that was something he did not expect .
&quot; N@@ ene re@@ members to have heard that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar cane industry has already resist@@ ed the pla@@ gues , the fall of socialism , the low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad management decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 . &quot;
&quot; the news would have been a motive for concern for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no more news . &quot;
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off ?
the old platform of the church already saw better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the cr@@ ushing of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated , and hardly competitive they became unbe@@ ar@@ able for the country . &quot;
&quot; the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes . &quot;
they left only the factories that could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar@@ s must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound according to the 2016 published report &quot; &quot; Agricultural perspectives &quot; &quot; by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organization . &quot;
&quot; if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , raw sugar exports would generate about 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; the present day will surely enter history , &quot; these were the first words of Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began . &quot;
&quot; the following years saw the shut@@ down of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further training . &quot;
the same happened at the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , talks about the closure of the factory , the word he repe@@ ats most is &quot; sc@@ am . &quot; &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents said the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
&quot; in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full time working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first year of events , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; these were officially written documents , which would only be distinguished with regard to the parts that would be removed , addressed to the add@@ res@@ see and the date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal . &quot;
from then on the responsibility was passed and the letters came more and more frequently .
&quot; Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the shut @-@ down factory for two years and was one who received the letters . &quot; &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in operation &quot; , &quot; he ass@@ ures . &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , awaits the retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory in whose construction he helped .
&quot; with every part he removed , he dis@@ mounted one of his 31 working years . &quot;
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and the main work bench has been wi@@ ped out .
&quot; in many cases , there were no alternatives to the workplaces and services that were generated in the communities in which they were located . &quot;
&quot; we will never know if during the Mam@@ mut &apos;s speech of October 21 , 2002 , the former president looked into the eyes of the people who were present , when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would go well . &quot;
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane factories
sugar cane has been extracted only highly by grinding since 2004 .

&quot; after two years , Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar cane factory closed , or rather , when they began to det@@ on@@ ate , they also stopped to asp@@ hal@@ ve the road , this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other companies . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to search other factories . &quot;
they have been replaced .
&quot; without a perspective of the future , many young people also left the region . &quot;
&quot; in the area , a food factory was created , whose production serves not even for the supply of the community . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
&quot; at the end of 2016 N@@ ene returned to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work . &quot;
&quot; forty @-@ nine years ago , the old soldier brought a pension of two thousand pes@@ os a month to spend the years reti@@ ring in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ene , a man of black skin colour , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a suppor@@ tive person , yet he does not forgive the lies that one told him . &quot;
they have been tor@@ turing him for ten years .
&quot; N@@ ene walks into retirement at age 65 , not because it lacks power , but because it is bitter . &quot;

first Nations young people use hip hop to express themselves and get their own culture

&quot; the youth of the First Nations communities throughout Canada deal with topics that are important to them . they do so by means of hip @-@ hop , thanks to a series of hiking workshops . &quot;
&quot; as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an Tour , workshops and youth centres have been bringing workshops and youth centres directly to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach young groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances . &quot;
&quot; the original workshops were led by the teacher David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North Que@@ bec with ten C@@ ree communities and then worked with the C@@ ree Hip @-@ Hop group The Nor@@ th@@ stars . &quot;
&quot; the workshop is thus increasing that the young participants meet topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , engagement , love , self @-@ acceptance , &quot; or whatever comes to mind . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the youth are the protagon@@ ists .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team also collabor@@ ated with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka State . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the tribal region of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a section of road in West@@ kan@@ ada , where nearly two dozens of mostly indigenous young women were disappeared or murdered . &quot;
the cases were mostly not elu@@ ci@@ dated .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka C@@ ree First Nation uses the motive of a video player to convey the importance of preserving traditional customs and customs despite the influence of globalisation .
&quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people don &apos;t always have the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i C@@ ree First Nation recorded , the chor@@ us is sung on C@@ ree . &quot;
&quot; the young people took some help from the Nor@@ th@@ star hip @-@ hop group , who gave them a St@@ rop@@ he in the dialect of Eastern James Bay C@@ ree . &quot;
&quot; on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , the St@@ rop@@ he is available in tran@@ scription , as is a translation into English translated into German : &quot;
sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me
but I try to continue my days on Earth
that is the day when you will take our cry
because we as youth have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
this is how they can grow and move forward as well as our youth .
this is how they can do what they intended for the Creator .
&quot; in the commentary box , the reader and pro@@ pon@@ ent of the C@@ ree language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also makes a contribution and adds the St@@ rop@@ he in sy@@ ll@@ able script ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) : &quot;
&quot; in Japan , plastic courts are not only shown in the restaurant &quot;
&quot; plastic courts ( &quot; &quot; the scale &quot; &quot; ) outside of a typical restaurant in Japan . &quot;

&quot; in Japan , you can see plastic courts in front of almost every restaurant . &quot;
&quot; to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , are displayed near the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( &quot; &quot; plastic models of dishes &quot; &quot; ) from any food served in this restaurant . &quot;
the customers see themselves in these plastic courts and then decide whether to enter or continue the restaurant .
there is a whole industry devoted to the production of these plastic courts .
&quot; there are a large number of small businesses in the to@@ ki@@ er district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which produce those plastic courts that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most Japanese , these plastic courts are usually that they don &apos;t even notice them anymore . however , a new trend is now transformed into show@@ y mobile accessories and other gad@@ gets . &quot;
&quot; at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
&quot; now in special sale : new with plastic rub@@ bers decorated cell phones , as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store . &quot;
&quot; many of these artificial food were turned into kit@@ sch@@ y collection objects , as in this case , refrigerator magn@@ ets : &quot;
here are a few sho@@ ebo@@ arding refrigerator magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom of ess@@ ences is becoming increasingly more complex .
in this case a ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) turned into a mobile stand .
for this tri@@ angular dish ( lol ) we found a good use as a mobile stand .
we also made this part for the exhibition in Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple that contains your mobile phone :
&quot; designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and this is only the beginning of an increasing approach to the comic .
&quot; some mobile phone stand and mobile designers allow you to produce your own work of art . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a or salmon are used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice . &quot;
&quot; on Twitter , some users had their doubts : &quot;
&quot; someone who would say : &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile with laugh@@ ing che@@ ating ? . &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
&quot; this interest in plastic rib@@ bons can also take a less appeti@@ zing form , for example to surprise colleagues or family members un@@ pleasantly . &quot;
our latest mobile stand has the shape of mel@@ ted ice .
&quot; in addition , there are also pad@@ st@@ ables ( oni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands made of dried salmon . &quot;
&quot; other qu@@ ir@@ ky plastic courts can be found at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter , h@@ ash@@ tag # , to see the &apos; # &apos; . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , then this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which is devoted to the supply of the restaurant industry . &quot;
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic courts actually are made .
a Mexican project tells the stories of survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot;

&quot; in reports from domestic and foreign media about the not@@ orious &quot; fight against drug trafficking &quot; in Mexico , the susp@@ ects and killed regularly appear only in statistics , but these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; reporting on drugs bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a @-@ Kart@@ ell , crowded the stories of the victims of the conflict completely in the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the ber@@ eav@@ ed or the churches that have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; behind every body , behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never heal . &quot;
&quot; this is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co has launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; with the drug trade &quot; ) , which is to give these victims a voice and nar@@ rate stories of people who were involved in the struggle between the law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els . &quot;
animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co describes the project :
organised crime not only causes us to fear our lives .
the effects are much more profound .
&quot; for example , when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities therefore have to go many kilometers to buy something like milk . &quot;
the pain of the victims
a video titled &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how afraid life changes &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
&quot; a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who searches hidden graves after his son every weekend . &quot;
&quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews on only one day . &quot;
&quot; priests : &quot; as every Sunday , we prepare ourselves today for the task that we have set ourselves to go and search for graves , according to the people we have loved . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; on October 15th , he was supposed to be back , but he never came back . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta said : &quot; it is very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need training . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , who is also here with me . &quot;
at the moment it has no income .
&quot; you are the insurance of my father , but she doesn &apos;t pay them out because they demand a death certificate . &quot;
where should we get them ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and governance . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co , wrote this article from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal , no matter what form it occurs : &quot;
I have been familiar with disease and sensation@@ alism for several years now .
&quot; every day I pass newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the front pages with pictures , which can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from collabor@@ ators . &quot;
it brings me out of the frame .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to that body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
it writes on :
&quot; no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old cous@@ in thinks that he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) when he is big . and it &apos;s not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets . &quot;
for me it is as if they ridi@@ cu@@ le those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something has happened to them .
I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statisti@@ c .
&quot; the in@@ action of the people is incredible for me , if the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring town is justified by the fact that they were &quot; &quot; wat@@ ered &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think they try to persu@@ ade themselves that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies , if they do not touch and remain silent . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the main town district : how a family was sack@@ ed by threats . &quot; in this , she describes how armed criminals pressed money from their business until they end up destroying not only the business , but also tore their family apart . &quot;
you think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
&quot; the pain above never passes , the trauma stays , fear comes up again when you are alone . &quot;
&quot; habits have changed , phone numbers too . &quot;
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the farther we are from each other , the better . &quot;
she closed her report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , for you don &apos;t know when they will kidn@@ ap you or kill you . &quot;
&quot; in these terrible days I asked myself whether crying would dissolve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with the pain . &quot;
journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a Generation of Viol@@ ence . &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who cares for the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow up in a settlement at the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care about them . &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan is a orph@@ an and he says that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , make potatoes , make tor@@ till@@ as warm and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for each year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
&quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood was past two years before , when he was just a few blocks from his home , seeing the bloody corp@@ se of his father , who had been shot by armed men from a passing car . &quot;
&quot; when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this : &quot;
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 when violence was mixed by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the Civil Coun@@ cill@@ or for Public Safety and Government of the Government of the United States . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the public prosec@@ utor had 3@@ 103 mur@@ ders . this corresponds to an average of 8.5 mor@@ es per day . &quot;
these are just a few hundred thousand stories that leave organised crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country .
&quot; only a few stories continue to live in the face of new head@@ lines . however , this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co created the narrative journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose aim is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking , which has tor@@ mented the country in the last four decades . &quot;
when a picture is worth a thousand words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this post and the pages linked to it include images on which violence is represented .
the factor check is important in a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing fal@@ si@@ fication .
&quot; but how is the year after something has appeared for the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to continue to exist . &quot;
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
&quot; since its first release , it has been mis@@ leading to photograph trage@@ dies that have actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this false coupling of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful coverage of events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but it raises questions about our desire for images to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; in 2010 a tan@@ ker crossed the town of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ted around and explo@@ ded . 230 people lost their lives . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country had been neglected for years and devast@@ ated . the streets in the region became dangerous paths full of pot@@ holes that were difficult to navigate . &quot;
&quot; tra@@ gically , the tank truck fell victim to that . &quot;
&quot; officials described a fire@@ ball , which envel@@ ops dozens of houses including a cinem@@ as close by , which was full of people who watched the World Cup . &quot;
houses wasted and char@@ ted corp@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to ignorance .
&quot; a picture with the title &quot; &quot; This is Nigeria &quot; &quot; by Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ users Mysti@@ cal Monkey , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the gru@@ es@@ ome scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of char@@ red bodies str@@ ung on the ground while people look at them .
but here the story does not end .
&quot; over the years the same photo was taken several times on social media , blogs and other platforms and wrong@@ ly attributed to real trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
&quot; on 3 January 2015 , fighters of B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on . &quot;
witnesses reported dr@@ astically the atro@@ cities they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; no one left to count corp@@ ses , &quot; &quot; said a resident of Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many were dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned . &quot;
&quot; only on the basis of satellite images , the follow @-@ up time could be depicted graphi@@ cally . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the Bag@@ a military base was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ an and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
and here the picture from the DR Congo emerged again when it was fal@@ sely presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
that is Nigeria .
&quot; a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris . &quot;
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this frau@@ dul@@ ent use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a number of mis@@ app@@ ings ; Africa Check has documented access to Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in all these cases , the picture was presented as a proof of mass kill@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; one step further , personal comments such as this example mistakenly assume the picture from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to deliver arguments . &quot;
the image of S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a blitz@@ krieg , published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee were beaten , rape and several dead , some through burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported on the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Post@@ s appeared like the following who brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture was taken from an Saudi Arabian news page , mistakenly claimed President Myanmar &apos;s Th@@ ein Sein have said that monks and politicians had participated in the murder of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image of the DR Congo to photograph this information . &quot;
&quot; the original contribution , which last accessed on April 26 , 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot;
&quot; other news organizations called AF@@ P as their source also fal@@ sely attributed this statement to Th@@ ein , but had not associated with the image of the DR Congo . &quot;
the worldwide range of false information
traces of these false links extend back to 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; using an &quot; reverse image search , &quot; you can see how far information can transc@@ end boundaries . &quot;
&quot; an inver@@ ted picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) 3@@ 44 images , which are very similar to the said picture from the DR Congo . &quot;
&quot; they come from a mixed mass of private parties , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
&quot; some have passed incorrect reports , some have attempted to expose fal@@ si@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; we have limited examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use and linked them to the respective countries , on the basis of which page they have been published . &quot;
&quot; from the countries listed below ( which in some cases have also been inter@@ connected ) , several examples can be used for impro@@ per use . &quot;
&quot; here are some cases , which can now be detected completely ( on the map in orange ) : &quot;
map : news Fr@@ ames .
examples of false cop@@ pers of the image from DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries point to pages or servers that are still available through the examples of for@@ geri@@ es or fal@@ seh@@ oods .
&quot; the countries in Gra@@ u are examples that , according to the metadata and information available via Tin@@ Eye , are likely to show precip@@ itation examples . &quot;
&quot; as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;
&quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot; &quot;

&quot; Nigeria , 2012 . &quot;
&quot; even within Nigeria , the photo from the DR Congo was shared as evidence of the bom@@ b@@ ings of B@@ oko Har@@ am in K@@ ano in public discussion forums . &quot;
&quot; Malaysia , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Malaysia offers two extreme examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo , on the one hand , a tweet that expresses sympathy with the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre and on the other hand , the attempt of a blo@@ gger to deli@@ timi@@ ze the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are prosec@@ uted , since the photos were mis@@ used . &quot;
&quot; Myanmar , 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the Myanmar government has published a lev@@ y on what they considered as &quot; deliberately resour@@ ceful news and photos , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings with respect to Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this judgment , which was published exclusively in English , also includes references to fake images of rum@@ or that are used by H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and are used by extrem@@ ist groups to show that Muslim Budd@@ hi@@ sts kill and mig@@ rate ( which is often spread by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) . &quot;
&quot; Russia , 2012 . &quot; &quot; catch of the catch of the catch &quot; &quot; ( Christi@@ an@@ opho@@ bia or political pro@@ vocation ? ) . &quot;
&quot; this post , addressed to members of the Russian Orthodox Church , clearly states that the image of the DR Congo does NOT show Muslims that kill Christians . &quot;
&quot; Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this news page fal@@ sely claimed that the President of Myanmar held his existence in 2012 , that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of S@@ ange . &quot;
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture is still contained in it .
&quot; Spain , 2015 / 2016 &quot;
&quot; this article from 2014 about students who had been killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , released from the now deleted message from An@@ á@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has explicitly stated that the image does not originate from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it represents a &quot; &quot; similar jihadi@@ st attack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when the picture was later put into circulation in connection with the massac@@ res of the B@@ oko Har@@ am of 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria . &quot;
&quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ Dün@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burns , the world is sleeping ) . &quot;
&quot; the image of the DR Congo came up with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , triggered a discussion among Muslims following the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to achieve a greater attention to these events , presum@@ ed in the name of Islam . &quot;
&quot; United States , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the image was weather@@ ed as evidence of the massac@@ res of the B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 ( and ret@@ we@@ aving more than 9,@@ 300 times ) , but the messages associated with it were not taken up in any religious context . &quot;
&quot; instead , the target was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage in comparison with Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
&quot; Vietnam ( Chinese ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message allegedly written by a &quot; &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums such as this one in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it to be false . &quot;
&quot; from the message in which the image of the DR Congo was contained , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ ine Mission@@ aries and Fr . Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos avoided . &quot;
&quot; there are other confirmed examples of fla@@ wed use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; the Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the craw@@ ler and occasionally they have image file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
&quot; in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture ultimately bears a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and images
there are two strong themes or frames ( fr@@ aming ) that go through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photograph was used in relation to greater discussions about silence in connection with the mur@@ ders of Christians by Muslims or - for defending the Muslims - the kill@@ ings of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ rated as compared to a European or French life .
&quot; to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts . &quot;
&quot; however , a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these pictures . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are dozens of people who have in@@ adver@@ t@@ ently share the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; suggests this mood of wrong and false information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and ad@@ orn the actual horror of what is actually happening in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ? &quot;
the spread of forci@@ ble images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( here for example ) .
&quot; one argument is that with@@ holding images of a refusal to recognize the tragedy . at times , these pictures are even asked by the victims themselves . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the concern is that violent images des@@ ensi@@ tise readers and viewers and take the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( for example , this study that investigated how violent media act to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot to discuss about violent portra@@ y@@ als in the news media , it is a fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting . &quot;
&quot; techn@@ ologists are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against fake news . you will have to think carefully about the situation in which a picture suggests something , which can actually be used by context or completely impro@@ per style . &quot;
&quot; however , each investigation of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be . &quot;

the &quot; un@@ transc@@ end@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy Sim@@ mons is using the CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
&quot; a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g. insur@@ moun@@ table ) stri@@ ves to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world , which are difficult or not at all to be translated . &quot;
such words exist in every language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well known ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) .
but all stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly resist every attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; a word or expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes a bit of context are required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists cover Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages . &quot;
&quot; in the blog you can find , for example , words from the VAT @-@ cla@@ p language of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as : &quot;
v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - As@@ k yourself about your parents in recognition of how to deal with you in your younger years .
&quot; words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as : &quot;
k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The comfort or la@@ z@@ iness you feel after cold days in the sun .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
&quot; they def@@ use other cultures , reveal other thoughts , and aw@@ aken our curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , how we analyse and classi@@ fy the world around us , the lingu@@ ists on this page want to publish even more of these &quot; irre@@ plac@@ eable &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these little languages are . &quot;
&quot; speakers of the Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages , which are highly appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite villages here . &quot;

how Sri Lanka deals with the worst floo@@ ding catastrophe of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst floods and floods in this decade .
&quot; initiated by the mon@@ soon , which usually starts at the end of May , the rivers of Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya have gone over the banks in 15 districts in the south and west of the country . &quot;
&quot; according to an opinion of the Sri Lanka catastrophe centre of 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost 100 people are missing because of the floods and sl@@ amm@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; over 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100,000 people have been transported to 30@@ 4 safe places . &quot;
&quot; the rainf@@ alls took place on Saturday ( May 27th ) , and the water conditions in some areas went slowly . &quot;
health and hygiene conditions of the population are a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
floo@@ d@@ water in the Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water stands of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates on the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the disaster .
&quot; Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods ag@@ grav@@ ate the Den@@ gue crisis , warns Save the Children , after further rainf@@ alls already are on its way . &quot;
&quot; this morning , the N@@ elu@@ wa Bus in flood , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also flooded due to the water level of Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a yesterday . &quot;
the Air Force has provided five air@@ planes for rescue operations and another five are prepared for the transport of emergency supplies for the residents trapped in their flooded villages .
various organizations and startups are also preparing to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood and humanitarian assistance .
&quot; if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 . &quot;
for those who want to don@@ ate dry foodstuffs and nec@@ essi@@ ties for flood victims -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 today if you need help in this area .
the taxi call app Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the app so that the Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ en@@ entrum will be informed .
&quot; last year after the disaster of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ me introduced a &quot; flood aid &quot; button that allowed users to call a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations . they were then forwarded to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross for free . &quot;
&quot; they also launched a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; button , which resulted in more than a thousand inquiries and 150 successful boat rescue operations for people with floods and land@@ slides . &quot;
&quot; the combined efforts of the government and civilian population of Sri Lanka , with which several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring people to security and help women in need . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of further human lives , with the population of Sri Lanka the long way to restore normal@@ cy . &quot;

the Women &apos;s March on 21 January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
&quot; in January , I took part in Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbor and dear friend . &quot;
&quot; I have trusted in her my four years old daughter , she trusted in me her children : she is my rock in the fire . &quot;
&quot; in the one minute , we call still slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights . &quot;
&quot; in the next , we have rights for trans@@ gender . &quot;
&quot; we are in a sea of umbr@@ ellas and people , some hold the iconic image of a woman with a head@@ sc@@ arf , bound by an American flag , other cann@@ on slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; These things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslim ? &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who know me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; built up in their imagination .
they are dis@@ car@@ essing me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t all look the same .
we practice our religion differently .
&quot; we identify ourselves to be a Muslim , in different ways . but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim thrust . &quot;
&quot; this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , as I do not fit there , are being dis@@ car@@ ded . &quot;
to become a Muslim
I don &apos;t stand alone with it .
&quot; this is even happening to the poet , whose poetry is most widely sold in America : Rum@@ i . &quot;
what images do you think of when you think of him ?
love ? love ?
peace ? peace ?
as Jal@@ alu@@ d@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
&quot; Islam , the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were the center of his poetry until the day he died . &quot;
&quot; but in the Western idea , the religion of Rum@@ is was wi@@ ped out , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
this del@@ eting makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another is in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims who have been colon@@ ising Western books for centuries .
this enti@@ cing image language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
&quot; in the 1970s , the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid de@@ compos@@ es the story behind these images . &quot;
but these pictures still prot@@ ru@@ de today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to join them . &quot;
&quot; I have worked in the news industry for thirteen years , and I have seen how these powerful , er@@ ron@@ eous nar@@ rations dominate our news@@ feeds . &quot;
&quot; this sc@@ ary over@@ shadows the reality that in the last three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the US could not even choose their first female presidential candidate in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this narrative fails to recognise that when French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings , and Saudi , Muslim women by their government are forced to cover their entire body , both of which are two sides of the same coin . &quot;
a powerful group exercises its &quot; control &quot; on the &quot; other . &quot;
&quot; this strong narrative weak@@ ens Muslim women , leading movements for change . &quot;
it is clear that the first Muslim Pra@@ yers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who were hi@@ jack@@ ed with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er Muslims .
this Nar@@ r@@ ative has occupied our collective imagination so deep and fla@@ wed that often Si@@ kh @-@ men and children become the target of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and har@@ ass@@ ings .
&quot; because of these stories , which we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is today not just fear of Islam , religion , but fear of the &quot; other . &quot; &quot;
the 1.7 billion are part of
&quot; in the news industry , we do more than just telling stories based on facts . &quot;
or on alternative facts .
we also create nar@@ rations which help us to understand the world .
and my industry has failed to capture the tri@@ pod of the 1.7 billion .
&quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims make up the highest degree of &quot; diverse &quot; religious group in America . &quot;
more than one @-@ third of the entire Muslim population is African American .
six out of ten American Muslims are among the first @-@ generation immigrants coming from 77 countries .

use approved .
&quot; four decades ago , my immig@@ rated parents came to New York to live their American dream . &quot;
&quot; my mother put her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue , and my father worked hard in New York &apos;s sky@@ scra@@ pers . sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American stat@@ or from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan . &quot;
&quot; back then , when Khan re@@ thought the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were un@@ miss@@ able Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I now un@@ aware Muslim and American ?
&quot; sometimes when people ask me why I &apos;m not eating pork , I say - instead of taking out my Muslim recipes or my hand@@ some hand@@ ker@@ chief that all Muslims carry - &quot; out of respect for P@@ epp@@ a W@@ utz . &quot;
&quot; I j@@ ure , we don &apos;t carry all hand@@ ker@@ chiefs with us . &quot;
we also do not need to be the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be selected almost always for additional security checks at the airport .
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists trying to fight far @-@ spread lies about Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced by a well lubri@@ cated Islam@@ opho@@ bic machine with back@@ ers , think tanks and experts for mis@@ information , which have manipul@@ ated our already faulty picture of what a Muslim is ; or of what Islam is . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories that we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is more than just a stranger who tears a woman &apos;s head . &quot;
&quot; or as the sc@@ ary map of attacks on mos@@ ques around the US , see below . &quot;

Islam@@ opho@@ bia in its ug@@ ly forms attacks our affili@@ ation .
&quot; it attacks our identity , which is so broad , so versatile and complex that it cannot fit into a drawer . &quot;

use approved .
I would like to explain that .
&quot; I was born as Muslims , but I was born into my imagination only when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York . &quot;
&quot; when social scientists describe religious life , they rever@@ t to the following terms : faith , behavior and affili@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith and behaviour may not always be visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbor , my rock in the Brand@@ ing would see that I am Muslims when they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot;
&quot; she would see the all @-@ ni@@ gh@@ tly ritual with my daughter , when I held her in my arms and she whis@@ pered the Arabic verses to protect the Koran and called the Q@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
each of them I repeat three times .
&quot; I ask that they are protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim belief is always part of my shadow . &quot;
&quot; the author &apos;s grandmother , when she wins an icon competition in Kar@@ achi , poses with her sisters sometime in the 1960s . &quot;
use approved .
&quot; belonging is the image of my grandmother on my mother &apos;s side with her sisters , how she gained a competition of art of floral arrangements in Kar@@ achi for decades . &quot;
&quot; it is the picture of her that I see at this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her finished and un@@ finished paintings , painted Su@@ fi saint ; and a Qur &apos;an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , which she can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze . &quot;
to be Muslim means to speak the prayers that she had told me when I had a bad day .
&quot; to be Muslim is how they taught me to refer to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people that , over hundreds of centuries , has been colon@@ ised by an &quot; empire &quot; that has established a company called Hon@@ orable British East @-@ India Company , it has a profound meaning to call God my only Lord . &quot;
the author in 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
&quot; belonging meant to grow up and to hear that men do not cry , but at the same time to see that my immig@@ rant grandfather cries . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , while he writes books about modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana Ja@@ an wept because of his family in India , K@@ ash@@ mir , family whom he could not close to his arms in half a century . &quot;
&quot; affili@@ ation is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , as with my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have divided the Muslim world as at the game risk . &quot;
&quot; to be Muslim means to know that over the last two centuries Europeans have &quot; &quot; colon@@ ized &quot; &quot; all to four Muslim countries . &quot;
it means to know that the first pilot bomb of history was dropped over a Muslim country a century ago .
&quot; it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , ash@@ mir@@ y under@@ tan of the British empire , was called &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time , as he led the first mosque in England . &quot;
&quot; before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I was ever , preaching the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;
the word of Islam .

belonging to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion goes deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ acknowledged history .
&quot; it means remembering that fourteen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops scattered over every continent apart from the Antar@@ ctic , went to Iraq to pursue mass destruction weapons that did not exist . &quot;
it means to know that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried under the ruins of war .
to be an American Muslim means to know that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
&quot; it means knowing that if a tragedy visits the US and the suspect carries a Muslim name , history is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that fourteen hundred years ago the first cry of prayer , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liberated black slave with the name Bil@@ al . &quot;
it means to know that two hundred years ago an African Islam@@ ist called Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this land .
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we get up for our dreams and when we say black life .
&quot; to be an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Muslim and a journalist , means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple lines , but to fail to communicate them to others . &quot;
&quot; the tri@@ pod of the 1.7 billion contains more possibilities than a magic cube , but it is represented in the reducing duality of &quot; we &quot; against &quot; it . &quot; &quot;
&quot; being a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people build structural anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility to this duality . &quot;
structural anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility is made up of Muslim registri@@ es that began with President Bush and extended to President Obama .
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists of immigration officers who take a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that sh@@ uts its borders to people from just the countries that bom@@ bard them .
&quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; No @-@ Fly list , &quot; which targets mostly Arabs and Muslims . &quot;
it is the wars that we lead and the bombs which we reject to Muslim countries .
&quot; due to the stories we tell and due to those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists of the Nor@@ th@@ western University showed a scientifically uns@@ ur@@ passed picture and asked them to assess groups on a scale of 1 to 100 concerning evolution . &quot;
Muslims got the lowest score .
the conversations that we have to carry out
we are too deep to enth@@ use the Muslim or the &quot; other . &quot;
we stand back for decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the fla@@ wed and dangerous ima@@ gery that we ste@@ er in our news editors .
&quot; at least , there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history . &quot;
&quot; the Pod@@ cast lake Som@@ e@@ thing , Sa@@ y Som@@ e@@ thing von Bu@@ zz@@ Feed ; the Pod@@ cast # Good@@ Mus@@ lim@@ Bad@@ Muslim ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ elo Square over black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to increase Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel - all this makes me hope . &quot;

col@@ lage of the author .
but I am concerned about this difficult global timing in which we are in .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is one reason that conspiracy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet now lead the White House .
they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
&quot; a few years earlier , they had not yet given them ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot;
&quot; I am concerned about the realities and the history that I was not aware of when I was as old as my daughter is now , but who today made me an irre@@ ver@@ sible Muslim . &quot;
things that I left here like a bread@@ crum@@ b track in my speech .
&quot; things that perhaps evoke memories , because in all the inter@@ sections that our humanity makes , a story may l@@ ur@@ k where someone is made to a &quot; other . &quot; &quot;
&quot; right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , conversations within the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia are taking place . &quot;
&quot; more than a hundred academ@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural racism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot; &quot;
but these are not terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us or read them in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; why do I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where , however , Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars will be led and people by creating the &quot; other &quot; in public performance , have been scientists of Stan@@ ford four decades ago . &quot;
&quot; we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of being aware and un@@ consciously the &quot; other , &quot; as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the occupation that we have no president , the chocolate cake , while he already bom@@ bed broken countries and &quot; to other &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot;
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art aims to preserve urban language diversity
&quot; story telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ user Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 . &quot;
can there be a possibility to contact someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the initiative Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , telling stories in their original language is a possible answer . &quot;
&quot; global Vo@@ ices recently reported on a different initiative by Steven Bird , the irre@@ plac@@ eable blog . &quot;
&quot; here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language diversity of large cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has held events since 2015 , the risk that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there . &quot;
for the cre@@ ators of the project :
the mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that embrace diversity - secure spaces where residents don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong .
&quot; while &quot; listening is often associated with understanding , &quot; these events instead &quot; listen to feel , feel , touch &quot; instead . &quot;
&quot; in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers put their story in their own language first and translate or explain their story in English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ eller , their dedication and their representation allow the audience to intervene . &quot;
they evoke the laughter and emotions as the language is no longer a barrier .
&quot; the following video , for example , shows a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the Daf@@ ing language . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate also takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of stor@@ y@@ telling . &quot;
&quot; in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ ara tells the parable of the h@@ are and bab@@ o@@ ons in the language of Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe : &quot;
&quot; after explaining the importance of his parable , John Ny@@ am@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is this to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in , he shares his feeling of inclu@@ si@@ veness : &quot;
you have listened to it !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
&quot; up to now , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and organizers hope to extend this . all those who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS in order to organize their own stor@@ yt@@ ellers . &quot;
Puerto Rico calls for rein@@ statement of sovereign debt from the US
&quot; with the aim of re@@ viewing the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounts to 72 million US dollars , various religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration on April 3 , 2017 ; the march launched at the Republi@@ can Cap@@ it@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went down to Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans . &quot;
it was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ ce &quot; ( Ci@@ tiz@@ ens Front for the Ne@@ ural Ex@@ am@@ ination of D@@ ebt ) and the Com@@ edi@@ an Church Assembly in Puerto Ri@@ cos .
the advoc@@ ates of re@@ determination of debt have also filed a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos are calling for politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for their debts for their corruption . &quot;
&quot; we call for a financial audit and a Ste@@ ering Committee without any personal interests in public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions corresponding remuneration , which acts in favor of the economy . &quot;
we are black@@ ma@@ iled and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos refuse to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not settle down with falling pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not the sovereign territory of the United States - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
&quot; therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Center for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ governmental non @-@ profit organisation with a focus on soci@@ o@@ economic development , proposes a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state supervision . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis Puerto Ri@@ cos requires extensive restructuring of the state infrastructure .
measures imposed extern@@ ally will run without the participation and conviction of citizens in danger of being rejected by the people .
the demonstration was called &quot; Night@@ Guard for Light and Truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :

&quot; more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and members continue the campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions he has made for an open network . &quot;
&quot; this year &apos;s re : Pub@@ lica , the annual conference on digital culture , which is hosted in Berlin , dedicated itself to the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign . &quot;
&quot; Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ nay , a scientist of the French resident CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , managing director at Book S@@ prints , produced excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive Inqu@@ iry ( The Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive Refle@@ ction ) . &quot;
&quot; the book , which was published last year and is available here roy@@ alty @-@ free , contains a number of essays that deal with free culture in the face of oppression . &quot;
it is a tribute to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it says :
this book wants to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built up and what are the real costs associated with .
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news@@ feeds and to create some sense from our different experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been detained in Syria since 15 March 2012 . &quot;
&quot; his name was removed from the directory of the A@@ dra prison , in which he sat on 3 October 2015 . &quot;
since then we have no information on his current status or where@@ ab@@ outs .
&quot; the introductory part of his book entitled Collec@@ tive Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce gives his friends and his family a voice , who want to push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , instantly . &quot;
&quot; seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in free culture , many of us have started thinking about their own f@@ ates , deeds and decisions . &quot;
why are we here today ?
what did we choose ?
what have we given up in this process of temporarily extreme beliefs ?
the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in custody since March 2012 in the custody of Syrian government agencies .
&quot; in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution , to an unknown location . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; military police Bass@@ el had taken on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military tribunal from his prison in A@@ dra . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i reported that she was contacted by persons on November 12 , 2015 , who presented themselves as an inside of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband . &quot;
&quot; however , his place of residence and condition remain unknown . &quot;
&quot; a pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently crossing the ladder of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project created by Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
&quot; perhaps none of Bas@@ sels found cultural prototypes for@@ esi@@ ghted as the work he started with a group of arch@@ e@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 , in order to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the world &apos;s most important archaeological sites , was the cross@@ roads of numerous civi@@ lizations and here the Greek @-@ Roman architectural types merge with local traditions and Persian influence . &quot;
&quot; at that time Bass@@ el could not yet know that ten years after he began this work , the IS would do everything to wipe out this architecture , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world . &quot;
this expe@@ dient to digital arch@@ e@@ ology and preservation has created a time capsule which will be inv@@ aluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
&quot; tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el could not finish this project yet . &quot;
&quot; N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband , sharing his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison : &quot;
&quot; I spent my entire life in dre@@ aming of freedom , and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her . &quot;
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
&quot; Bass@@ el taught me English , even when he was already in jail . &quot;
&quot; I learned to read , write and speak English well . &quot;
&quot; he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked . he has taught other prisoners to read , write , and speak English . &quot;
Bass@@ el opened my door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
&quot; he also taught other prisoners as they use computers , at least theoretically , without actually holding one in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of waiting ( waiting ) , a pro@@ vocation that she wrote to her husband in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in custody . &quot;
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together in the book for a year .
&quot; she smu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him , when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic into English . &quot;
the book is available roy@@ alty free .
book cover from Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It is happening &quot; :
&quot; it happens every time you visit , &quot;
&quot; that I sink in the world of your beautiful eyes , &quot;
&quot; that I lose the mind in the moment we embrace , &quot;
that I don &apos;t care about any of the dangers :
&quot; each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guards &quot;
I forget the confin@@ es of the prison
&quot; and I enter into every detail of your voice and words , &quot;
&quot; which I bear with passion , &quot;
when your eyes say goodbye
and I leave another piece of my soul with you ...
&quot; I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness , &quot;
&quot; to bring back all the moments , &quot;
and to we@@ ep and smile about your absence .
I witness myself that I will return soon ...
&quot; on the first anniversary of the detention of Bass@@ el , G@@ haz@@ i wrote : &quot;
&quot; a year goes by , my soul &quot;
while there are no translations available
&quot; I am in your cage , &quot;
and you are still in the cage of monsters
Bas@@ tille &apos;s history is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the protests in 2011 against the regime Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared , according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) . &quot;
those who were arrested or disappeared under the regime were tortured or even executed .
&quot; by 2016 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International , at least 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have died in jail since 2011 . &quot;
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
we repeat today our demand in the hope that we have to do for the last time .
&quot; Mozambique : due to corruption convic@@ ted , post @-@ release director on previous post &quot;
&quot; with anger , Mos@@ ambique re@@ acted to a corruption case in which a member of the government returned after half of his sentence to the workplace in the state apparatus , where the corruption was committed . &quot;
&quot; it is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , which was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison in 2010 along with four other defend@@ ants for the mis@@ appropri@@ ation of 54 million Me@@ et al ( approximately 800@@ ,000 Euros ) . &quot;
&quot; the money came from public funds from the Mozambique airports , whose advice was Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 because of good management and immediately called for his re @-@ adjustment to the company , which happened on April 19 . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which rejected the motion , there would be no obstacle to Cam@@ ba@@ za to return to his old post , as the company did not carry out disciplinary proceedings after his detention . &quot;
&quot; however , many people do not call the action well . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with Deutsche Welle , the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Int@@ egri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , C@@ IP ) , condemned the decision of the company to re @-@ establish the director : &quot;
represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and under@@ lines the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards with regard to the efforts of our legal system such as C@@ IP .
what we are aware of is that even the company should have initiated disciplinary proceedings against the contrary .
&quot; the company , however , seems to have no reasonable legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , also re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case as &quot; &quot; contrary &quot; &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent type , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of which had been lowered . &quot;
&quot; he could hold paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image . &quot;
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he cons@@ ented to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped to inflic@@ t damage . &quot;
&quot; consequently , it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za will gladly pay for his silence . &quot;
contradictory !
&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , a young Muslim and student of political science in Brazil says , the director has no moral : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state because he offen@@ ded him , I can &apos;t believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that the state has already been so massi@@ vely offen@@ ded . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za is missing the mor@@ als and serving the state , * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead only served themselves on the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money , and the state itself has become tired of this man who was pre@@ charged and finally sentenced to long imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; to be honest , I don &apos;t know why this man was rewarded in such a way . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remember that a th@@ ief is in jail : &quot;
&quot; thi@@ eves are part of the Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el prison , which will not only remain in memory for the Mozambique people but also as the first independent president , but also as a sharp , single @-@ ed@@ ged and - by the way - proph@@ etic speaker . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral presentations was when he vigor@@ ously confirmed that &quot; an ambitious man is capable of all , even the father@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest , to sell . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious person changes , my experience shows that it is not so . he changes the tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions . &quot;
an ambitious person is criminal at the same time . &quot;
&quot; in Twitter , the reactions were also rejected : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , spending 10 years and free . &quot;
&quot; and today the company , in which he res@@ ig@@ ns money , sets him back under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - я@@ α@@ Mega@@ structures e.V. &quot; ( @ az@@ mal _ Ra@@ fik ) May 12 , 2017 &quot;
E@@ mil@@ do Sam@@ bo from the magazine @ Ver@@ da@@ de ( to dt . : @ truth ) states that crimin@@ ality pays off in Mozambique :
&quot; in fact , to be in # Mos@@ ambique &apos;s th@@ ief and servant of the # F@@ rel@@ imo , pay off . # Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , sentenced to long life imprisonment , returns to # airports of Mozambique - E@@ mil@@ do Sam@@ bo ( @ E@@ mil@@ do@@ Sam@@ bo ) May 11 , 2017 &quot;
Facebook blocks the &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; rac@@ ist word in Myanmar and cens@@ ors many users wrong@@ ly
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or spl@@ its .
&quot; photo by San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Com@@ mons , Creative Com@@ mons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ ported &quot;
&quot; according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known Social Network took their posts from the network because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although the origin of the word is still being discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; &quot; Indian &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Facebook cens@@ ors the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; by &quot; &quot; ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese writing ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma within the social network . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely dis@@ gra@@ ceful con@@ notation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar , the company cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; indeed , &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; may normally be associated with racism , but the word itself does not automatically evoke hate speech . &quot;
&quot; context is important &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; many people have reported that Post@@ s , in which they discussed the use of the word or expressed doubt for their use , were cens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with different mean@@ ings , which have the same character sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , the chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ qi &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ king A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos;@@ so :
a mail of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way whether they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a pu@@ n . &quot;
the phrase ku la - &quot; He@@ aling &quot; ( ku ) + the question face ( la ) in Bur@@ m@@ ese resembles the rac@@ ist expression very much but the context is completely different .
there were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
&quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is the opinion that she will reduce the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical before del@@ eting all posts that are suspected of spreading racism . &quot;
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you are writing on Fac@@ e@@ ook .
&quot; what it should do instead , is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the words next to it . &quot;
&quot; for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists , who spread hate speech , have received a fairly good lesson . &quot;
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to all who spread hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long . &quot;
&quot; the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat demonstrated that the cens@@ orship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks can simply start using a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views . &quot;
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to delete his posts when he only wanted to share his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned from the social network :
&quot; when I was aware of this new Facebook gui@@ deline , I made a mail to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my mail was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited from posting , posting and sharing content for 24 hours because the post &quot; didn &apos;t meet the Facebook community standards . &quot; &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who do not have any negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his mail was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
&quot; in the post , the author expressed his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad . &quot;
&quot; Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community ask for advice : &quot;
&quot; Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce racism in Burma through its platform , but it does not work . &quot;
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the various communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; pe@@ a cur@@ ry . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the wrong@@ ly deleted posts . &quot;
&quot; if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a great deal of sales , that would be great . &quot;
ebooks automatic cens@@ orship has ensured a lot of ridi@@ cu@@ le among users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts , which contained no hate speech , but were still removed : &quot;
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ a cur@@ ry and watch an Indian movie .
only to try out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word Kal@@ ar .
screen@@ shot used with permission .
&quot; the post states &quot; If you are a doctor , do you then heal people ? &quot;
screen@@ shot used with permission .
&quot; in the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists , who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , Hass@@ an in social networks should additionally address violence in Myanmar congregations , especially Rak@@ h@@ ine , where confron@@ tations between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts forced thousands to flee . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised for its failure , the balancing of hate speech on its Bur@@ m@@ ese sides . &quot;
&quot; but rather than cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to focus more on context than initiatives focused on code and learned from them . &quot;
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago concludes with the children &apos;s marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .
&quot; photo by Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC B@@ Y 2.0 . &quot;
the children &apos;s marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , Parliament of the country unanim@@ ously approved a law bann@@ ing this practice , so that the age @-@ retard@@ ant age is now at 18 . &quot;
&quot; in May 2016 , Brother Har@@ ry@@ for@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the Inter@@ religious Organization ( IR@@ O ) , a group that conven@@ ed representatives of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere because that , age does not determine maturity . &quot;
&quot; despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are a contractual partner of the UN Convention on Child Rights , the min@@ ors are defined as &quot; &quot; every man under 18 years &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; statistics of the UN for 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children who were married to 15 in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago amounted to 2.8 percent , and at 18 it was 8.@@ 1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married to 19 in 1997 @-@ 2007 . &quot;
&quot; online peti@@ tions and social media movements , which were eager to abol@@ ish laws for children , followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped bring this result . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hind@@ u leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about telling the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they were to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this really un@@ complicated matter , and at some point there were doubts as to whether the opposition would agree with the bill in general . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of 2017 the bill was decided against the children &apos;s marriage - despite 4 Sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , who ab@@ stained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law . &quot;
now only the president of the country has to agree and let the law be announced .
one of the Sen@@ ators of the country gave on Facebook a status update which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle posted on Inst@@ ag@@ ram again :
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was voted in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes for this and no one against it .
&quot; having previously been approved by the Senate , the draft can now become a law . &quot;
the majority of social media users were thrilled because the laws for children before finally had been changed .
&quot; member Lo@@ vel@@ l Francis , who is a minister of ministers in the Ministry of Education , said : &quot;
&quot; it took too much time and unnecessary talk which disgu@@ ised the heart of the matter , but do you know what ? the children &apos;s toe is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that is worth almost every price . &quot;
&quot; while Abel Jackson was of the opinion , it took a long enough time to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day had finally arrived : &quot;
&quot; public Status Update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which states : , Her@@ vor@@ ing news ! &quot;
the law has been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , Vo@@ ices - 35 for that - 0 on the other hand ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group that spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was : &quot;
the marriage @-@ capable age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago now amounts to 18 years regardless of the religious affili@@ ation .
&quot; the plan for am@@ ending the marriage network was decided today , on 9 June 2017 . &quot;
there are 41 de@@ pu@@ ties in the House of Represent@@ atives and 35 were present during the vote .
all parliam@@ ent@@ arians who were present have voted for the law .
the children &apos;s marriage is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ birth @-@ shiel@@ ding .
many thanks to all the activists who fought him .
congratulations . congratulations .
a thank you to our de@@ pu@@ ties .
&quot; yet a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most known Hind@@ u organization in the country . &quot;
&quot; months ago , Mahar@@ aj announced his intention to take judicial steps , and the law was to be passed , and it seems to replace his promise . &quot;
&quot; while the At@@ tor@@ ney General of Paris Al ra@@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , said it was quite legitimate if Mahar@@ aj wanted to act against the law , most social media users wanted to change the debate on the subject . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rel@@ l proposed :
&quot; dear Sat , if we , instead of discussing the discussion so broad@@ ly , in a way that can only cause panic and dis@@ grace , if we , instead of talking about the problem , that the state , our daughters guard against it , would be ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled men who are facing them , would you then be ready to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
&quot; but whether it comes to judicial proceedings against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where the children are legal or still the norm , although there are laws they prohi@@ bit . &quot;
H@@ acker trol@@ ley the office of the prosec@@ utor in front of nationwide protests at the Russian National Day
screen print of the message posted on Sunday early on the Y@@ ar@@ os@@ lav@@ l Public Prosecutor &apos;s website .
&quot; on the eve of the national demonstrations against corruption that coinci@@ de with Russia &apos;s Day - Russian National Day , the website of the prosec@@ utor was h@@ ack@@ ed by Y@@ ar@@ os@@ lav@@ l district . h@@ ack@@ ers left a wit@@ ty message &quot; staying at home . &quot; &quot;
or we take you to jail instead of Dim@@ on . &quot;
the h@@ ack@@ ers posted the YouTube video &quot; He is not a Dim@@ on for you &quot; on the prosec@@ utor &apos;s website with the following comment : &quot; the Office of the Public Prosecutor calls on citizens to not follow the pro@@ vocation and keep away from all non @-@ sanc@@ tioned events !
&quot; at 11.@@ 15 the message was removed from the side - however , in the buffer it remained . &quot;
it has disappeared in #
&quot; on Sunday morning , the Office of the Public Prosecutor informed the local news service Y@@ ar@@ news that they were h@@ ack@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; by mirr@@ oring web pages , Turkish users can view Wikipedia content again &quot;
&quot; on 18 January 2012 , the English @-@ language Wikipedia site was depicted as opposed to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the United States . &quot;
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
&quot; for over a month now , Turkey has been blocking the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia . &quot;
day by day it becomes clearer how important the platform for users is to find and share helpful and reliable information .
both students and re@@ porters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the blocking .
&quot; although many technology @-@ sav@@ vy Internet users are used to using conversion tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times report that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ valence ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been blocking article from Wikipedia since 2008 , as recently described in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular blocking of the Internet has been held since 2007 , after the Internet Law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted . &quot;
&quot; after China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform remains locked , there are now several mirrors ( pages reflecting the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform placed all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its de@@ centralized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( so host computer connections ) , which is not based on the domain name system and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult . &quot;
&quot; the content , however , can be retri@@ eved in spite of the legal prohibition . &quot;
&quot; in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about his efforts : &quot;
&quot; after listening to the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we put everything in place to cover snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . &quot;
this can help users to at least view all Wikipedia content even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedia a.@@ org .
&quot; IP@@ FS also reported that this step was carried out independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia @-@ Foundation , and it is just screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website . &quot;
&quot; however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock . &quot;
&quot; Cr@@ istian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has brought tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedia , a m@@ irr@@ or@@ page from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that anyone can use to host similar mirrors if Wikipedia is locked in the respective country Wikipedia . &quot;
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i - Global Vo@@ ices Member as well as staff at Mozilla &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; pod@@ cast :
&quot; it is not a complete copy of a proxy address , a mirror . &quot;
one acc@@ esses to another URL that is not the original . that what you see then is from Wikipedia .
&quot; essentially , the server re@@ direc@@ ts the inquiry to the correct Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia themselves if they are locked in Turkey . &quot;

Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were blur@@ ry with badly positioned motifs and washed colors .
the motivated him to carry a camera with him and try to strai@@ gh@@ ten out the situation .
back then he was still a child .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to bring Nepal to the international stage . &quot;
&quot; and his home town right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife . &quot;
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ class location helps in his work :
&quot; I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! ! &quot;
I just rested at home when suddenly called me Navar@@ re ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river a le@@ op@@ ard would be .
the river dam@@ m is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
&quot; my father had watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was , and I immediately began to kne@@ el pictures ! ! &quot;
Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves for cooperation with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
&quot; and he should know &#91; it &#93; , for he was standing on the tig@@ ers face to face , &quot;
a tiger can not distur@@ b itself from the opinion of the sheep while sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
bed@@ time for all animals and birds .
&quot; also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the king of the book heav@@ y@@ weight appeared . he immediately sat down , we look at us and he gaz@@ es at me through the S@@ al @-@ trees ! ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals Sag@@ ar places the logo &quot; &quot; I click for conservation &quot; &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot;
but his passion for promoting Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife and wildlife is not always easy .
&quot; he waited for 22 days , and mostly lived in a tent in order to take pictures of Ot@@ tern in the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation . &quot;
take a look at some of these photos below .

&quot; this article was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ hei@@ a and originally appeared on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international collaborative media organization from India . &quot;
a revised version has been re @-@ published here as part of a content @-@ sharing convention .
&quot; in many parts of India , women have the greatest care to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family . &quot;
instead they use a pron@@ ou@@ n or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that because of the social pressure they should respect the husband , as well as fear of the consequences , they should dis@@ regard the norm , keep this practice alive . &quot;
&quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted from the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a by a false court and rejected by her family and community after she had addressed a married relatives with names . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of calling their wives also not by the name is also common among men . however , they have far less rebu@@ ke to fear , if any , they should not follow this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , among them health workers as well as house@@ wives , entered a unique club and became the main topic of the city quickly . &quot;
it is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
&quot; as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , he is part of the # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al campaign , which is operated by the community of Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and advoc@@ ates for the exploitation of patri@@ archy . &quot;
&quot; for seven years , Roh@@ ini Pa@@ p has been working with her video camera to cover practices such as child marriage and bann@@ ing HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS infected , and leads this club . &quot;
she reports on how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambass@@ adors of change .
the first video showing Roh@@ ini in their discussion was women who do not call their hus@@ bands on their names .
she chose this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which women can easily identify .
not to speak al@@ oud the name of their hus@@ bands is a custom that they all uph@@ old and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not consider this is regarded as dec@@ eit@@ ful as a woman without morality .
tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about it until this discussion .
&quot; at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never named her husband by name , wanted to try out at home as it runs . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband kept silent for a long time after the video was over .
&quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him from now on his name . &quot;
Roh@@ ini started their first discussion with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage .
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected . &quot;
at the beginning of the round Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
&quot; after the video projection , the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked every participant to tell her husband &apos;s name with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she asked all , &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us as they want , does that mean that they do not respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their hus@@ bands over their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ste from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra over breaking a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which married women can never pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
Roh@@ ini tells :
a woman was so shy that she was ch@@ ich@@ led only before her during the whole exercise ; another decided to release the whole frustr@@ ated fru@@ stration against him and his family by cursed him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; in the adren@@ alin rush to have broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that they would actually try at home to name their hus@@ bands by name . &quot;
and they kept their word .
&quot; in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports . &quot;
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put in the head : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it before dinner before the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law gaz@@ ed at her , she was afraid and said that it was a mistake . &quot;
another woman said : &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it .
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in force .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zinc red dot on the forehead , which shows the Eh@@ est@@ atus : &quot;
why do women only have to show that they are married ?
&quot; I told my husband that I would wear the in@@ ox @-@ red dot , if he did it . &quot;
he laugh@@ ed only and I stopped wearing him .
&quot; the other women have not completely stopped , but think they are now in a better position to choose to not wear it on some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can share their opinions and goals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip at each discussion club . &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want women to take care of who could hear , &quot; she says . &quot;
in the last months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their lives ; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things , for example our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to be able to say certain things , no matter how small it is . &quot;
&quot; in a panel discussion , we talked about the concept of honour and how it is associated with clothes . &quot;
some women in the group have only supported sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; for most it &apos;s okay , but some wanted a sage @-@ cur@@ ta to wear a wide shirt over a pair of trousers ; they didn &apos;t dare . &quot;
&quot; after a lot of arguments and discussion about the advantages of the choice of clothes , the moral associated with the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini smu@@ g@@ gled their own pair of Kur@@ tas ( upper shirts ) into a discussion round so that women could wear them . &quot;
&quot; next , they decided to take a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will do it . &quot;
&quot; on the question of whether something has changed in the five months since their first discussion club , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are moving slowly : &quot;
&quot; so far , we have only done small steps . &quot;
&quot; some women tasted it a few times , but then stopped to say the name of their husband . &quot;
&quot; some , including me , still do it , but only when they are alone and no other family members are there . &quot;
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ tin on their forehead at any time .
women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like hag@@ gling around more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothes - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
&quot; by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
how Roh@@ ini declares :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy .
I am too .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .

screen@@ shot of the official YouTube channel of the Beat@@ les .
&quot; on 29th June this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag was to be found in the Japanese Twitter trend , where many fans shared memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les . &quot;
the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is considered a turning point in the Japanese culture of the post@@ war period .
&quot; the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ i@@ ko , who recently inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les in London in 1964 , noticed in 2016 on the occasion of the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit : &quot;
&quot; for just about five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through . &quot;
it became clear to the people here that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many famous Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
&quot; the music of cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; said Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , President of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review . &quot;
&quot; good morning ! &quot; &quot; today is the Beat@@ les Memorial Day in Japan . by 51 years ago , they were here in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; also today , songs from the Beat@@ les are sung in Japanese kar@@ a@@ oke bars and in English classes at Japanese secondary schools . &quot;
the kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les survi@@ ves everything .
today is Beat@@ les @-@ Memorial Day .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; W@@ inn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll is meant to be John L@@ enn@@ on or not .
&quot; and as it is for fans , Japanese people of course also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the famous places that are related to the band . &quot;
&quot; if you love the Beat@@ les , this is your 5 places that you absolutely must visit . &quot;
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fiel@@ ds ( memorial in New York )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
&quot; 5 ) ( From link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool &quot;
the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges can sometimes not be bizarre enough :
good morning together .
today is Beat@@ les @-@ Memorial Day .
&quot; in 1966 , the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time . &quot;
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran across Abbey Road .
we did the same last year too .
&quot; and of course some companies use the fan community in terms of market technology , like this R@@ amen @-@ Shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! &quot;
and what could that be for a day ?

bald men are ab@@ duc@@ ted and killed in Mozambique
the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia warned the population that bald men in Mozambique could be target of attacks .
&quot; photo : unlike Bol@@ in / Fli@@ ck@@ r , CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 &quot;
&quot; a new system of kidn@@ apping of bald individuals for organ trade , probably for ab@@ uses , is al@@ armed by the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called for a number of operations to stop the practice . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ek , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi . &quot;
one of the victims was found to be found and part of the organs had been removed .
two men were arrested and subsequently led to the use of the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi .
&quot; there is local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a man of a bald man could have gold , or could bring wealth , explained the police spokes@@ man of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia to the BBC . &quot;
it is the first time successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique .
&quot; another group , the goal of mur@@ ders for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot;
this led to the fact that the UN 2016 carried out a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice .
&quot; persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of Southern Africa , particularly in neighbouring Tanzania where the government developed campaigns to combat this super@@ sti@@ tion and prejudi@@ ce . &quot;
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the town of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who intend to travel to the country :
&quot; attention to k@@ ah@@ le men , who travel to Mozambique and headed for ritual attacks , the Moz@@ ambi@@ can police warned about the latest assass@@ inations of three bald men due to their body parts . &quot;
&quot; two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ek , where the kill@@ ings took place . &quot;
&quot; Hus@@ sene Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the town of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e , south of Mozambique , said that the local police are already following the case : &quot;
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
&quot; the persecution and murder of cross @-@ headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ ru@@ mb@@ ala , province of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , has cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , which also indicates that a faith exists , according to which the victims in the head might have power to generate wealth . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country . &quot;
&quot; Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ anth@@ a shared the chron@@ icle of the blo@@ gger of the poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa on Facebook , indicating that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique : &quot;
&quot; I like M@@ Ö@@ CH@@ TE like E@@ IN Mos@@ ambique , THE S@@ ME is ashamed of a country in which people would have shame to demand sex against good marks , and who would not viol@@ ate sex against good marks , or even take their lives to get their bread , a country in which people would not be hun@@ ted or bald or bald for ab@@ using purposes or &quot; black magic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some of the opportunities for mac@@ ab@@ re humor were not missed . &quot;
&quot; Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist from Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic Twitter user twe@@ et@@ ete that both the head of the Mor@@ ru@@ mb@@ ala district , Pedro S@@ ange and police spokes@@ man Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , both are bald : &quot;
the Muslim authorities are very concerned about the kill@@ ings of bald people .

we are deeply affected by the death of our friend Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il .
&quot; we mo@@ urn for him and speak our heart@@ felt sympathy to his family , friends and all those who have known him and loved him . &quot;
&quot; a pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria , active in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) was a key role in expanding public access to the internet and open knowledge . &quot;
he was a close friend of many from the Global Vo@@ ices community and participated in our meeting in 2009 .
&quot; in November 2015 , Bas@@ sels wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by persons who claimed to be an inside of the Assad government . &quot;
&quot; they reported that their husband was sentenced to death , but did not give any further information . &quot;
Bas@@ tille &apos;s stay and constitution were unknown until today ( 01 August 2017 ) when N@@ our@@ a of Syrian officials learned that he was executed in 2015 .
&quot; today and in the future , we are doing the honor of creating Bass@@ el as a pioneer of the open web movement . &quot;
and we appreciate the efforts of all the people and organisations that have been campaig@@ ning for their release in the last five years .
&quot; since 2011 and the beginning of the protests against the regime of Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared , the organisation of the Syrian Network for Human Rights . &quot;
countless of those arrested by the regime or forci@@ bly disappeared are subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions .
&quot; between 2011 and 2016 , no less than 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have died in custody , such as the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International . &quot;
the fate of many people remains unknown .

&quot; free Bass@@ el : citizen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New reactions of the international community for medical treatment of Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate and dis@@ sident Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o &quot;
&quot; a photo by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , probably just recently made . &quot;
&quot; this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 in Hong Kong Free Press . &quot;
the following version is published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of detained Chinese dis@@ sident Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had been announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized for liver cancer in the final stage .
&quot; in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to 11 years in prison for &quot; &quot; Subversion &quot; &quot; following the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o calling for democratic reform in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the Department of Foreign Affairs in China has referred to Li@@ us case as &quot; an internal affair , &quot; and a spokes@@ man says he did not consider it necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot;
&quot; however , China continues to receive calls from the international community , Nobel Prize winner and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , or to allow him to be treated abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have completely wi@@ ped out the issue . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press summ@@ arized some reactions from abroad .
united nations
&quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss Li@@ u &apos;s case . &quot;
&quot; however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Li@@ u to be treated abroad . &quot;
Norway and Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway was ki@@ cked off after the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
&quot; diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed only in December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume exports to China , as exports have largely been blocked since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; after spreading the news that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope of unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to his detention , he was unable to accept his price . &quot;
&quot; during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair . &quot;
European Union of the European Union
&quot; on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a decision in which China was urged to release Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants . &quot;
&quot; the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for China to release Li@@ us , as stated in an explanation on 30 June : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect that China lifts all limitations of Mr. Li@@ us &apos;s wife and family members . &quot;
&quot; they should meet and receive all the visits they wish , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot;
United States of America
U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told us that the Americans &quot; wish him to have the opportunity to treat abroad so far as it helps him in his recovery .
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced that the message agency AF@@ P announced on June 27 that the embassy asked the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u , but also to release his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the invitation of the US embassy reloc@@ ated a fur@@ ious response from China , with the statement of the State Department that &quot; no country has the right to interfere and make ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared that China should offer the following :
&quot; protection and freedom , such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his choice , which they claim according to Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the US sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also adopted a resolution in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally . &quot;
I urge China to release the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condition@@ ally so that he can get into a proper medical treatment . htt@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany and the USA
&quot; German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin hopes that Li@@ u will receive all the medical support he needs and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot;
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping appeared on the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg on 7 and 8 July .
&quot; previously reported diplomatic sources in the news agency Reu@@ ters reported that China had great concerns , whether the vor@@ tex for Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg . &quot;
Canada and Canada
&quot; on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um China called on China to provide Li@@ u with adequate medical care and to give him the opportunity to take care of his family . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ u lawyer told AF@@ P previously that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always supervis@@ es the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to talk to someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues telling :
&quot; Canada calls on China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and to permit restrictions to exercise these rights . &quot;
France - France
&quot; on 29 June , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs called for China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons : &quot;
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs . furthermore his wife and his family should have contact with him .
&quot; although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there was no further information on whether France will ultimately receive it . &quot;
Taiwan and Taiwan
&quot; on 27 June , the Council of Continental Affairs in Taiwan urged China to release Li@@ u and to show greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot;
&quot; Tai@@ wan@@ ese leg@@ is@@ lators , Yu M@@ ei @-@ nu , from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party , also called for China to allow the sick @-@ intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan . &quot;
Dalai Lama
&quot; the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned about Li@@ u in an explanation on June 28 , and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ u &apos;s well @-@ being . &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my belief that the initiatives he took and which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn contributed to a more peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I felt personally very moved and also encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , signed the Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;

is Singapore a city or country ?
&quot; the question may seem stupid , since Singapore is recognized as an independent state at an international level . &quot;
&quot; but according to the Minister of Justice , K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g , Singapore should be regarded as a city . &quot;
this remark has spark@@ ed a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
&quot; during the meeting at the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the New York State Bar Association , the minister noted that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of Singapore &apos;s only political party because they were compared with other countries . &quot;
he supported Singapore to be regarded as a city .
no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
&quot; this is , most people commit a mistake . &quot;
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o blog accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; twist the logic &quot; to defend the existing authorit@@ arian exercise of power in Singapore .
&quot; and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious country , one hears that we are ultimately no country . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you &apos;re not my country , whose country is it then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g were not very noble : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &quot; normal &quot; countries , in the face of it , he appeared inevitably un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently guided by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; as soon as one reaches the central point of the subject , the good old ly@@ re comes up from the authorit@@ arian rulers who pre@@ tend to be democr@@ ats , leaving the twisted logic , since it fits better to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the end , the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam given answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judicial , our political system really non @-@ responses . &quot;
he tar@@ red corresponding questions in a rational way with non @-@ responses .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls on Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country but a city , so to which country belongs to our city ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I don &apos;t understand anything . &quot;
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g would take the trouble to clarify this point insofar as it was paid high to be part of the government of Singapore .
&quot; when An@@ on published his commentary on the blog , he points to the critic@@ isms that one should start reading the entire tran@@ script of the conference , so that one could understand the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country . &quot;
please read the tran@@ script .
&quot; when he said Singapore is more a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore are so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot;
he compared Singapore to cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; when he said that Singapore was &quot; &quot; no country , &quot; &quot; he obviously did not mean it in that sense ! &quot;
&quot; C@@ lement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ ck , who as the leader of a growing generation , makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement . &quot;
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice told of Singapore ...
&quot; at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Guard , what I expected - whether I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I doubt and I am not even sure whether he truly believes it , right associates , and aware of what he is defending . &quot;
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review sheds light on Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ ck &quot; &quot; commit a mistake &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian slip @-@ over speaker ? &quot;
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we are regarded only as an independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , what country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back ? &quot;
Singapore is unique ; it is equally land and city .
&quot; since he plays an important role inside the cabinet , Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g &apos;s statements are of grave importance . &quot;
&quot; why do the people of Singapur perform their military service , do they defend only their city but not their country ? &quot;
who does our prime minister have to pay back ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; journey of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore is and has always been a city : &quot;
I didn &apos;t say what I said ...
this sentence seems to have anno@@ yed many people of Singapore ...
nobody has ever said Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; the defense of the country , above all , &quot; etc . &quot;
we should rather speak of the defence of the city .
the My@@ th of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices recently asked its editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home country ?
your answers will be published here as part of an ongoing series with the ru@@ mo@@ urs uncovered about certain parts of the world and another fac@@ et is to be shown .
&quot; the most recent part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
&quot; the question that is most asked to me in Japan is , &quot; Are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; I answer . &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on what situation the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ utor by asking personal questions . &quot;
&quot; then most of the time the answer is the default answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice hockey , nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans probably cook domestic rage when they are held for Americans , but I don &apos;t mind . &quot;
&quot; for someone who does not know himself , there is little that distinguishes us Canadi@@ ans of Americans . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans make a Canadian flag clearly visible on their back@@ pack when they travel .
all love Canadi@@ ans .
Americans however ... .
&quot; so it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tru@@ mp , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 . &quot;
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ les on their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
&quot; all seem to think , Canada is so great . &quot;
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; obviously , we say very often &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most tolerant country against ethnic groups .
we are not as these guys south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
&quot; first , I have many American friends I admire very much . &quot;
&quot; it wouldn &apos;t matter to me , for example , if you were to be confused with Johnny from Dallas . &quot;
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
&quot; first of all , being called &quot; nice &quot; means being idle - like the gentle , gentle , but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; Die Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has its own Canadian Doppel@@ gän@@ ger ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada is really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing that one can encounter . &quot;
being harmless means to be in@@ conspic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and to earn no attention .
&quot; this can be a good thing if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far away from the things that happen around you . &quot;
&quot; I would even go as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone , is a main part of the Canadi@@ ans . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
&quot; what out@@ si@@ ders refer to as &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; is perhaps simply bold pol@@ it@@ eness . &quot;
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence with their neighbors .
&quot; we lack the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends . &quot;
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) J@@ ustin Tru@@ deau stepped onto the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot;
music video of a Pop @-@ Band par@@ o@@ ert Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; a popular pop band , famous in Thailand , has released a music video that par@@ o@@ ds the Jun@@ ta who seized power in 2014 and in spite of their promise to restore the civilian government , the country continues to reign . &quot;
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tat@@ too Colour describes a young man who tells the rules that his girlfriend does .
&quot; although not explicitly political , the music video still refers indirectly to the continued military domination of the jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video to the song was a huge success .
&quot; within the first three days alone , the video uploaded on Facebook was shared 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times and got 8,@@ 800 likes . &quot;
&quot; last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; Der Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists asked the public to watch this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially as regards the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule . &quot;
&quot; take a look at these photos of the video , which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has persist@@ ently tra@@ cked over the past three years . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the preliminary constitution , which gives the supreme commander of the army absolute decision making on important national issues . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ orious programme for the &quot; &quot; change in employment &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are viewed by the Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot;
&quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear regulations are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a new unit was established in the army that monitors online content and prosec@@ uted persons who were accused of having slan@@ dered the monarchy . &quot;
Thailand sets a strict end to &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ estic &quot; ( Maj@@ estic offen@@ se ) .
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , martial law was proclaimed in Thailand . &quot;
two days later there was a coup in the army .
&quot; one of the problems the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is to buy expensive U @-@ boats , even though security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money . &quot;
&quot; in the video it is even shown how individuals are thrown into a black delivery van , before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences , should they off@@ end the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the songs showed members of the band , who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Hunger Games , &quot; which had already been used by Put@@ sch opponents during the 2014 protests . &quot;
life continues in the ruins of the ghost towns in eastern Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia

&quot; the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and is published here with kind permission . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ war society reco@@ vers only very slowly in East Asia Minor , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; now over 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ ab@@ ch@@ as@@ sic war officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still visible in this part of the republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
&quot; villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the coal basin of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Mis@@ ha@@ zia , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in Soviet times in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today most of Russians and rab@@ bits live in the area .
such settlements are also called ghost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the district was 16@@ ,000 people , after barely rose over a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 , about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this area . &quot;

&quot; all this is a consequence of war &quot;
the empty five @-@ storey blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 60s which are called Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ uk@@ ho@@ kas are symboli@@ cal for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are deca@@ yed and rarely inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a local elder man .
he starts talking and it is hard for him to finish this .
&quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why speak ? &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it is unique . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were community centers , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens , all served by the community . &quot;
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded glory buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning of the Soviet Union have meanwhile abandoned the district .
in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha approximately fifty inhabitants live .
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; the Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ tsch@@ ow@@ kas , which accommodate one or two families , can be seen at the balconies where laundry is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me with the camera in their hand , they withdraw immediately . &quot;
&quot; our mother has forbidden us to take pictures , &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; it was simply forbidden to us , that &apos;s all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers somewhat to her friend and suddenly she leaves the destroyed building and disappears .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
&quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for personal use ) , such as livestock , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation . &quot;
it &apos;s difficult to get over the rounds .
&quot; in winter , the district administration supplies candles and bread to the villages free of charge . &quot;

&quot; despite her oldest daughter , who lives in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; my heart will stay forever in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , &quot; she tells . &quot;
Gal@@ ina doesn &apos;t want to receive financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sts she is supporting her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas &apos;s monthly pension is just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very hard to survive , &quot; she gives . &quot;
a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a tells that she and other villa@@ gers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 year old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
&quot; when holidays are , we visit us . &quot;
but we cannot do this all the time - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot;
&quot; while she tells her story , a younger neighbor appears on the balcony . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ asha , &quot; A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a calls her . &quot; they said we could add zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
I have already prepared the ground .

Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she re@@ members the village life before the war .
&quot; despite the relatives living in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia simply broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave . &quot;

Nat@@ asha receives approximately $ 9 child benefit for every child .
her husband is working in the coal mine .
the young family has their own farm .
&quot; near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once located , they hold pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chi@@ ckens . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark road or the few people . &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting . &quot;
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right for them .
every day I remember how the city and the war were once .
&quot; as our conversation ends , a little boy is running past us . &quot;
it runs through the window of a ruined building and hides itself .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .

in Mexico &quot; Mama Africa &quot; hosts migrants on their long journey
&quot; Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez runs a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border from Mexico to Guatemala . &quot;

&quot; on the path of migrants , crossing Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
&quot; I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , located on the border to Guatemala . &quot;
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
&quot; it is led by a 59 @-@ year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink spectacle frame and gold @-@ coloured earrings in ted@@ dy bear . &quot;
&quot; she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez , and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . &quot;
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
&quot; for about 2.@@ 50 dollars the night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign to the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants arrive here .
&quot; sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez talks , people get to the full small bus@@ ses and from the upper part of the coast they start crying : &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you m@@ um Africa ? . &quot;
&quot; currently it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some also slept outside on cardboard boxes . &quot;
she doesn &apos;t want to reject anyone .
&quot; she also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are ill , they buy drugs that they cannot pay for them , they massage them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted by the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived recently . &quot;
I asked him if Mama Africa is an appropriate nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; the Sebasti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a Yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t@@ beard ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez . &quot;
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; he answered with a smile . &quot; &quot; I really feel it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot;
very aff@@ ection@@ ate .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
&quot; you have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he says that the Hai@@ tians and the Afri@@ cans often travel together and that the Afri@@ cans speak to W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy became weaker , he started his journey to the United States . &quot;
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will contact Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; he answers smiling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells her that her guests often send text messages when they have left to greet them or tell her about the course of their journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
&quot; she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to cook chicken like in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
&quot; at the other end of the city , a blind alley leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family immig@@ rated this winter in their little house .
he is a polic@@ eman and found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive .
&quot; he started to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tians . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking station outside . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing . &quot;
I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support .
&quot; after having lived for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula come from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them . &quot;
&quot; José Antonio Cor@@ do@@ va Mel@@ én@@ dez told me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children , who wanted to black@@ mail him without having a plan . &quot;
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown , a single person , offered him her roof . &quot;
&quot; a few months later , the family still lives there and she tries to decide where to go the next step . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests .
&quot; in the corri@@ dors , the passengers quietly consult their phones . &quot;
&quot; a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , most of them from Somalia . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic , because of those who have gone away . &quot;
like a proud grandmother she leaves in her album with numerous photos .
&quot; there is one of her daughter with African hair spots she has made an art girl , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old . &quot;
she laughs sadly as she briefly presents her .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; she repe@@ ats every time . &quot; they have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a monitoring app on their mobile phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang by Twitter users to see the weather in X@@ inj@@ ang .
&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , ethnic minorities in western China , are forced to install sp@@ y@@ ware on their phones . &quot;
&quot; on July 10 , the mobile users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an area of the city of U@@ rum@@ qi have received a mobile phone notification in which they advise the district government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; &quot; Web Cle@@ aning &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the message , it is said that the app &quot; &quot; prevents access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , the authorities could also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ f@@ ecture because they , shortly after they had installed the app , had exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group . &quot;
&quot; in the communication of the police , the app was able to detect and prosec@@ ute the sources and distribution channels of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gen &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
&quot; J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om . &quot;
&quot; the main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network . &quot;
this app with the min@@ ors for min@@ ors is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate the home network of a person or steal from it . &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
&quot; while news about digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experience of users in larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , crowded ethnic minorities such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; to limit disturbances and dis@@ content in the areas of conflict , the authorities often arrange extreme acids and surveillance measures , as well as routine Internet shut@@ downs . &quot;
&quot; the Twitter @-@ based media outlet &quot; Images from mainland China , &quot; published cens@@ ored news in China , showed photos from a check@@ point where polic@@ emen random@@ ly checked the inhabitants to see if they had installed the monitoring app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian ensure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , you might be imprisoned for up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced people to use devices designed for older people .
this is a form of captivity through the rest @-@ growing technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from mainland China &quot; ( the most important part of it ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , which shows that the software can up@@ lift the application requirement of a Windows operating system and thus receives unlimited access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot;
&quot; after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones are used in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang to electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a response to the instructions of the town council to minimize the dis@@ semination of illegal content .
&quot; all branches of government , public authorities and affiliated institutions , including universities and research institutions , are required to follow the Cyber@@ security office &apos;s instructions when operating their computers and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; a recent report by Freedom House , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods : &quot;
&quot; the authorities published in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of U@@ rum@@ qi to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards &quot; at the local police . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist &quot; videos . however , this action viol@@ ates the rights of U@@ rum@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a number of other possible off@@ ences , including those relating to peaceful religious or political communications . &quot;
&quot; sleep or death , part 1 : everything cries out for death &quot;
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

&quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far from our blue , virtual world you look at yourself and realise that you are totally alone in a place where everything is van@@ ishing . &quot;
&quot; everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly recognizable , both from the inside and from the outside . &quot;
one who gives honour to her name .
one that has reflected in a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaph@@ ors .
&quot; but when reality reco@@ vers you and you look behind the scenes - beyond the actor , the beautiful scenes and the performer - the characters turn into beings of flesh and blood , and everything scre@@ ams after death . &quot;
&quot; all doubts arise in smoke and you will become aware of your existence , even if the earth continues on the axis of the un@@ healed . you realize that you are trapped between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , have built stone around stone . &quot;
&quot; they arrested me and my father three times , but that was not enough for me to learn &quot; my lesson , &quot; as the boss of the Security Service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure . &quot;
he proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five young people were torn away from the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest .
&quot; it was sufficient for the city to sh@@ atter the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; cries . &quot;
&quot; all the neighbor@@ hoods sought out , only my own . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was quiet , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time even if I had no high demands on a city that was stu@@ ffed into the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; in the third night , things had cal@@ med down after the power supply in the neighborhood ceased to work . &quot;
I interrupted the silence by scre@@ aming several times &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my roof .
I heard my voice resist@@ ed by the silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to assemble .
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we allied ourselves to a magnificent picture fulfilling my expectations . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment you realize that you release the mind from the lamp , but it is simply not interested in the least . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot;
he put up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can give you back your voice after you scre@@ ened it all the way to the office of the security service out of the body .
I arrived there .
the Col@@ onel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there as I now .
&quot; the Col@@ onel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to talk : &quot; let me listen , as you cry &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar , &quot; or you are brave enough to scre@@ am when we are not close . &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes focused on me .
and you &apos;re tru@@ sting what to look into my eyes and not on the ground !
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was about my fool@@ ish@@ ness , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution . &quot;
I was so sure of my cause when I replied : &quot; I wouldn &apos;t have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
&quot; and I think I have never stopped looking into your eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret a word of what I said . &quot;
&quot; put him in solitary confin@@ ement , and his father equally with it . &quot;
&quot; his father equally with it . &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cursed movement lies in my nose to this day .
&quot; he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a mental torture , which I was subjected to months . &quot;
I crossed the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I wear with myself .
&quot; then again through the yard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells . &quot;
I conc@@ eive all the details exactly before I enter the room .
&quot; unlike anything else , they have probably allocated a larger cell to me this time . &quot;
&quot; I have to share them with only one more prisoner , and I must immediately sit down without waiting for their permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the official left the cell and I resor@@ ted to an old @-@ tried communication method : beating the fist against the wall . &quot;
I learned that my cell gene was a &quot; first chief . &quot;
&quot; after a long hes@@ itation , he finally answered me . &quot;
&quot; apparently , in no one of the surrounding cells was a respected middle @-@ aged man who looks similar to me and is called &quot; the doctor . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in perfect darkness don &apos;t let me see any distinctive facial features , and there are no doctors here ; we are all just numbers . &quot;
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot;
all the answers deny its existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
&quot; the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would leave him , if I remain . &quot;
li@@ ars .
&quot; I would have liked to have a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive all these crow@@ s , which lab@@ ours on the fruits in the garden of my head . &quot;
&quot; from the distance I still hear them scre@@ aming &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it must be around 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the cries , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black is the colour of per@@ dition , until I saw the yellow light that showed us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( e.g. : &quot; th@@ under &quot; , reference to the 13th Sh@@ ure of the Quran ) . &quot;
they are here to be heard .
&quot; thus the secret was revealed : to protect the state security against us and prevent us from expos@@ ing the tra@@ itor and terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dialect - so they played out their sec@@ t@@ arian black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the narrow viewpoint of their world view . &quot;
this is not a house that is not a country here ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their c@@ lans into a hero .
&quot; I enter the audi@@ torium and meet at Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he appears to me . &quot;
&quot; he begins a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the facial expressions that are der@@ ailed to him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than to join this diary and protest on demonstrations that will eventually come to an end anyway . &quot;
I didn &apos;t answer .
I got used to it not to reply .
I really can &apos;t say exactly when insul@@ ts and pun@@ ches after a friendly conversation have become an ordinary means of communication for me .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
&quot; some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished , even though I had done nothing to earn this punishment . &quot;
on punishment in all their diversity .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls this aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; confession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe which probably comes from the clo@@ aks .
your exec@@ ution@@ er rejo@@ ices in your cries .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot compete with him , and you cannot with@@ hold your cries . &quot;
&quot; my cries were not enough for him yet , so they exchanged the tube with a cable . &quot;
&quot; during my first arrest , I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator had worked as a garbage collector in the past , or whether it belonged to the normal working equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables in order to present us , from their point of view , great invention of a huge cable . &quot;
within a single hour three of them changed while I was still in the row .
&quot; I had lost any feeling in my body - and my voice , which is why I stopped scre@@ aming . &quot;
&quot; the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling and didn &apos;t take pleasure in it , which was why he resor@@ ted to an electrically charged staff . &quot;
&quot; electricity flow@@ ed my whole body , enough to supply my whole neighborhood . &quot;
my half @-@ naked body lying stretched out on the ground was the perfect power conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
it must have been around midnight .
&quot; I decided to sleep again , let &apos;s say that was my only option . &quot;
&quot; some hours passed , which happened to me like minutes . &quot;
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot;
&quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted youth : &quot; my Lord , my father has to worry terri@@ bly . &quot;
&quot; be quiet and move , you will be laid . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they always left me free .
where do they lead me ? !
&quot; the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance &quot;
Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smoked a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time indoors ; sometimes he s@@ anders to his screen , sometimes to his computer , back and again to his couch . &quot;
what you can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers or his ni@@ cot@@ ine stained lips .
&quot; he lives in the top floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel had forced its occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s family to flee from their village in Palestine in which they lived as fel@@ lo@@ ye@@ en ( e.g. : Far@@ mer ) . &quot;
&quot; for six years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority and questioned her well @-@ established opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ music . &quot;
&quot; with his music , which often deals with topics like orient@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . &quot;
&quot; at the age of 25 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted by borders in his mind , and he can sympath@@ ise with the people who suffer from the disa@@ strous consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he does not admit it openly , he has a special reluct@@ ance against the US foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones , has something to do with his identity as a &quot; Palestinian prisoner of the second generation , &quot; he calls himself even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think so , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b stresses . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; I think so , because I am a human being &quot; &quot; while he sp@@ ends in water @-@ dissolved nest @-@ café in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan . in this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
&quot; obviously , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a hot young junk has little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
&quot; basically , the gap of lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the swa@@ ying of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose are primarily speaking of freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially if you have a look at the neighbouring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is easy to do basic things - like drinking water in public during Ram@@ adan - in order not to land in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently , Jordan &apos;s Interior Ministry announced a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , for the second time . &quot;
&quot; some parliam@@ ent@@ arians who support the Islamic action front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ osexual act contradic@@ ts Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o , the cultural and traditional norms of the country , and the main reason for the concert tab@@ oo . &quot;
&quot; the de@@ pu@@ ties and former press spokes@@ men of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b in an interview with CN@@ N said that the concert &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; had been cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the singer . &quot;
&quot; many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism which questioned the proven legi@@ timacy of authorit@@ arian regimes across the region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la rated the Jord@@ anian people as a &quot; progressive suppor@@ ter of human rights , &quot; who continue to advocate an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement probably should not be simply the rhet@@ oric , but in fact reflected a more and more clearly cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan , which appears clearly in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b moved to Lei@@ be &apos;s traditional sex men by completing his vision of the fate of Arab women who have mar@@ ital sex . &quot;
&quot; the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently broken , unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the canvas . &quot;
&quot; it is surrounded by a red lake , perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should trust . &quot;
&quot; in the past few years , the number of &apos; Hon@@ orary Mor@@ des &apos; has increased in Jordan - the un@@ official out@@ war@@ dly left . &quot;
&quot; according to human rights Watch , the number of honour kill@@ ings reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is still ag@@ grav@@ ated that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure to support the women who have attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way . &quot;
&quot; according to a crime against crime in 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can &quot; &quot; remain in prison for an in@@ definite period of time &quot; , &quot; and for their release is often a long years of bureaucracy and the family &apos;s guarantee that nothing will happen to the woman . &quot;
&quot; also , H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s music enjoys great popularity and is well known not to shy away from topics that have long been considered tab@@ oo in his country . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he is not able to separate his music , which is full of explicit appearances on sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot;
&quot; politics was given to me , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b attacks the question of the Palestinian identity . &quot;
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in Gh@@ are@@ eb the focus is on poverty .
the list of the songs that are political at the core can be continued .
&quot; in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song titled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot; &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated notic@@ e@@ ably often :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is . &quot;
&quot; in the further course of the song , H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market on which one , in his words , &quot; can get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ faith , hetero@@ gen@@ eity or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
he noted that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay men and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on equality of LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals were heavily cens@@ ored until 2014 .
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya , to later note that his comments from the context were torn , twisted and cens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without cuts , but stre@@ amed only a edited version , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b acqu@@ ires openly for the Arabic LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance towards homosexu@@ als does not correspond to Islam . &quot;
&quot; he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ eva , a poet of the eighth century , who still remains in memory thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b is asking himself : if Abu Nu@@ h , who was to work on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was canc@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ic kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression , and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian intelligence service held several former governmental decre@@ es and members of the teacher association , argu@@ ing that they had critically expressed themselves on comments in social media regarding the problems rooted deep in the country . &quot;
&quot; in view of this , the concert of H@@ da@@ i@@ bs is only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; for him progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has led M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - that &apos;s how H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , thou@@ ghtful and internal changes . he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society . &quot;
&quot; in the end , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without interventions from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also about &quot; experiencing them . &quot; &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region will be approached with the help of music , art and literature of genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs , cluster muni@@ tions , and arti@@ fici@@ ally controlled demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least he hopes . &quot;
&quot; until the time has come , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and therefore resist . &quot;
this report was made possible by the Pul@@ itzer Center on Crisis Reporting that A@@ man is a student Fel@@ low .
&quot; Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori , one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan . &quot;
&quot; these big , extravag@@ ant warri@@ or dolls are so fantastic ! ! ! &quot;
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
&quot; it is assumed that there is a variation of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the fe@@ asts , drums and dance mar@@ ched over more than a thousand years , in order to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , em@@ iss@@ ary , to knee . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a great view . &quot;
one can only imagine how big these parts are ...
&quot; a community center in the capital , Meg@@ uro Badia , hosted a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally . &quot;
for a long time I look at the Meg@@ uro ga@@ jo@@ en : two for@@ lor@@ ries are to be seen straight .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer : &quot;
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ festival .
the sight of a 18 meter high car was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ vi@@ ans trade weapons against sh@@ ears and raz@@ ors

&quot; rarely , outward appearances and bodily care were as important as in this story , as they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crime and to promote a legitimate occupation like that of the hair@@ dresser . &quot;
&quot; El Cal@@ la@@ o , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of the capital Lima , a region with a very high crime rate where street rob@@ ber@@ y and illegal drug trade are everyday . &quot;
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region would not feel safe .
&quot; at the same time , Peru , like many other Central and South American countries , is experiencing a rising demand for aesthetic services for men . &quot;
&quot; the trend , the appearance and consequently the unusual hair@@ styles of famous athletes like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to getting more normal citizens into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these lav@@ ish hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired a yearly event , the dres@@ sers of the hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; experts face each other there to show who can create the most ec@@ centric hooks , as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) . &quot;
&quot; educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found here an opportunity to persu@@ ade young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to receive training in the hair style , which allows them to find work . &quot;
&quot; motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion . &quot;
&quot; before the school year beginning in March , the school offered special training workshops and reported some of its achievements : &quot;
&quot; in 1995 , we were the only school in the community and the district where we are very proud , because we have built this educational community out of love for the children . &quot;
Colombia : love Let@@ ters to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters

use with kind permission .
the following article is the edited version of the article &quot; Love messages to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love letters to people we know ?
&quot; is it not much more important , people who feel alien@@ ated , aff@@ ection@@ ate affection ? &quot;
&quot; this was precisely the question of the young Colom@@ bian activ@@ ist Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga of the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation , who encouraged young people to write letters to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters . &quot;
&quot; recently , their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to it : after years of negotiation , the Colom@@ bian government signed a peace treaty with the guer@@ ri@@ lla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary armed forces Colombia ) , which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
international was considered so significant that Colom@@ bian president José Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
&quot; before the Colom@@ bi@@ ans , however , there is still a long way until one can speak of a real reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters who lived in illegal camps for many years , subjected to a war rhet@@ oric and carried out arms around the clock , must now re @-@ integrate themselves into the lives of civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society , once again accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases , has become accustomed to deep hatred towards guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , must now support them in their ranks and support them in building a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bi@@ ans could join together and help in the integration process .
&quot; and that &apos;s exactly what they did : until now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , to welcome them back to society . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former guer@@ illa fighter , which should then be handed over personally . &quot;
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as Inspiration for the Campa@@ ign
&quot; the idea for the reconciliation was born on the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ istian had the opportunity to speak briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day , but those who need them much more need@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; he planned , he talked about sharing his love with people this year , who needed the most urgent response . &quot;
&quot; the plan to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now have to find their place in society and build up a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace , &quot; they say . &quot;
&quot; until now , more than 2000 letters were collected within the framework of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities in Colombia like Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á . &quot;
I would never have thought that someone would forgive me
the first 500 letters were submitted in one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
&quot; a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ ality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bog@@ ot@@ al Foundation traveled to the camp to deliver the letters personally . &quot;
&quot; the members of the F@@ ARC beha@@ ved as they had previously done , in order to accept the orders of their leaders . &quot;
&quot; but this time they received no orders , but letters full of support for people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; the political scientist Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a told later . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , an employee of the governor of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience : &quot;
&quot; after we handed over the letters , a former fighter took me through the camp of the guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I looked into one of the &quot; Cam@@ eras &quot; ( a kind of hut where the guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters live ) , I saw a guer@@ illa fighter who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go down , because beside him on the bed there was a M@@ GL gar@@ net , a deadly weapon in Sle@@ eping Beauty . &quot;
&quot; I still spoke to him and said , &quot; &quot; Hello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone wrote to me . &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never in my life someone wrote something so beautiful , that &apos;s why I answer it . &quot; &quot; suddenly the tears ran over the che@@ eks . &quot;
I hu@@ gged him completely and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates .
&quot; perhaps he was sorry about the war , he was sorry to be all the years of loyal companion to this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC , was the only way to keep him and his six brothers before star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes . &quot;
&quot; but now I know that there is a society outside , waiting for us with open arms . &quot;
&quot; so far , I have only learned how to deal with weapons . &quot;
&quot; but now where there is peace , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; at the start of the discussion , students and some F@@ ARC leaders joined a panel discussion . &quot;
&quot; the students were all grown up as already war , and the F@@ ARC was already active in secret . &quot;
&quot; this is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how the social injustice of the state imp@@ acted on the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the possibility of developing ourselves to a political party , we can help shape society in this country more just . &quot;
&quot; a goal of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles , &quot; one of them said . &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; listening to these people who had never heard heard and had no choice right now , and realizing that the people I often saw as monsters and even hate people with beautiful feelings turned around by their living conditions and their environment , was very painful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me . &quot;
&quot; but it comforts me that all men , including those who killed and done so much damage , can teach us something and give a smile and a hu@@ g . &quot;
many former fighters responded to the letters .
&quot; Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote , for example , Dar@@ í@@ o de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Archbishop of Cal@@ i , the following letter : &quot;
the Colom@@ bi@@ ans were prophes@@ ied that peace would reign after dis@@ armament .
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as there is ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to take up arms , stand up and protest for their rights . and that is fully justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we of the F@@ ARC now focus on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; that is why we call upon all the def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , for we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties . &quot;
&quot; there will be many obstacles on our way , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; this is followed by the translation of an article written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ ab@@ sum@@ owa , which was first published on the OC Media website . &quot;
&quot; gay and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; with terror , activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
but the threat that hangs over the LG@@ BT@@ Q community there is not just about overnight .
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is currently happening in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; several months ago , the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya conquered international head@@ lines after reports were published that dealt with the spread , torture and killing of que@@ er men in the Republic . &quot;
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities who arrested suspi@@ cious que@@ er men and put them into secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; they have brought a monster to the world &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina , a woman with a woman , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
since her childhood she felt that she was actually a woman .
&quot; when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , so she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group had experienced Ch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen from the gender equ@@ ation of their land@@ lady , the hunt for Sab@@ rina was opened . &quot;
&quot; in the end , she moved to the United States for fear of her life . &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I was a volunteer hel@@ per in a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman who was in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them all over the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his Ch@@ echn@@ ya friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya , who can remove this shame ? &quot;
&quot; after that , the photos of my documents through the whole W@@ hat@@ s@@ App did the round . &quot;
I was attacked on 10 October 2015 .
&quot; when I was about to bring out a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying : &quot; here &apos;s a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
&quot; when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; how long do you want to dish@@ on@@ or the family , you sc@@ and@@ spot ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
&quot; I just know that it was a young man , not 30 years old . &quot;
then I lost consciousness and finally woke up in the hospital .
&quot; apparently , some women had everything included and started scre@@ aming . &quot;
the man was fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
&quot; in the hospital , I learned that I had two wounds in my right lung wing . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : in which case wings were laid , in which of the men or women ? &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my documents are outdated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women . &quot;
I am very thank@@ ful for that .
&quot; when I first read his name on his office door , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am grateful to him for being respect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
&quot; last February , I received threats . &quot;
&quot; they called me , wrote to me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown . &quot;
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
&quot; they asked me to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya , to prove that all this was a lie . &quot;
&quot; they asked absurd demands : some said to me , I must prove it by running on top without going through the streets ; others wanted me to appear on official television in Gros@@ ny and say that I didn &apos;t change my gender that everything was only bad things , and Photos@@ hop . &quot;
I have particle size C - what should I have said on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for her .
some older people once talked to my mother on the street .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; They have brought a monster to the world that has corrupted not only your family , but the entire republic . &quot;
&quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot;
it was too much of my mother and she put a rope around his neck .
&quot; fortunately , the neighbours came and saved them . &quot;
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with dark@@ ened windows and a number plate with a 95 .
&quot; after it had happened for the third time , it became clear to me that there was something rotten . &quot;
my human rights friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you fly ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with her help I left the country , but then something incredible happened . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
&quot; shortly before I left Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived . &quot;
&quot; I bought them without registering , without identification , without everything . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the tr@@ ash .
arrived and checked in to the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my cell phone .
&quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I received a message : &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t believe , you &apos;re safe , just because you have left the country ? &quot;
our people know at which hotel you are stuck . you even know your room number .
only to prove it to you : it is the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine this ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in touch with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; however , we do not talk about gender equality , which is a tab@@ oo theme . &quot;
some traditionally Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements I still wear in me .
&quot; as much as I wish , I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier . &quot;
&quot; I always say that , as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with camera , I really try to look like the person I remember from her past - that is , my male form . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends , those who have stayed here ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
&quot; for him , I needed current information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I talked to someone who sat in ar@@ gun for a half and a half months .
&quot; he said that during Ram@@ adan none of the people were arrested and tortured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan failed to wait , and he did not lock a new wave . &quot;
most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives .
&quot; with that , I mean they probably invite the relatives who take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : are there still gay men held in these secret pris@@ ons , too ? &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says , there are not so many . &quot;
&quot; if , especially those who have no wealthy relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to settle for Kad@@ y@@ rows . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they are held there so that one can later present them as terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say , &quot; &quot; If they are killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim they had attacked any village or military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not simply disappeared , they were deliberately immersed in order to radic@@ alise . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : is that only a guess , or do you have a source for this information ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was incar@@ cer@@ ated one and a half months in ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard has grown .
there was nothing new from them ever since .
they just took them along .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , that person himself was there when these people were taken . &quot;
&quot; until now they were not introduced as ban@@ dits , but there were no reports about that . we suspect that such actions are quite possible . &quot;
why else would it not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already occurred in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think already before 2003 I was already known in the whole of Gros@@ ny when I was still living there - and I never had any problems .
in the grave !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sh@@ aria was applied , I never had any problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia originally intended to bring us to &quot; &quot; civil@@ isation &quot; , &quot; but in the end it was thrown back to the Stone Age . &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had d@@ yed eyel@@ ashes , wore bal@@ dness jeans and short tops . &quot;
the Ministry of Security of Sh@@ aria has never cur@@ bed a hair .
&quot; in front of the Russian theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , met a whole group of people like me . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several banks stood , and the whole city knew of it ; they knew why men , young people , met there . &quot;
we have never been offen@@ ded .
&quot; in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Don &apos;t worry about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot;
it is often said to children when they make fun of the sick .
&quot; OC Media : so they just closed their eyes before you , because they believed you were sick ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : yes .
&quot; they never insul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted and never struck . &quot;
OC Media : how long did this time of grace last ?
Sab@@ rina : so long before Kad@@ y@@ rov entered the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began talking about morality on television . &quot;
&quot; he spoke not about us per se , but primarily about the behaviour of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , one could feel how people began to change in the city . &quot;
&quot; who had sm@@ iled and laugh@@ ed before , looked at you at once with suspicion . &quot;
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home I could feel how the situation in the republic was steadily deterior@@ ating .
OC Media : what activity do you go now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the USA .
&quot; apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist . &quot;
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize te@@ ac@@ re@@ ffs , meetings , I esc@@ ort them to the hospital and help them to get food kinds . &quot;
I don &apos;t spend a cent for it .
I discovered these people myself when I r@@ att@@ led to the places of refuge .
I am Muslims and want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you have a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s sil@@ ly .
&quot; so nature , that has nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as Tsch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen , who want to make you white with foam in front of the mouth , that there are no ga@@ ys with them . &quot;
&quot; the Da@@ ge@@ ants have which , the Cab@@ ard@@ ines have which , the Russians also have which ; on the whole planet they exist - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I come from there , so it is unpleasant for me to hear something like that . &quot;
I met so many men here from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims fasting in the mosque and fasting during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
&quot; you know many think about transi@@ ent to men who love men , and they believe that you change their sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things , two different ways of feeling to be exact , different attitudes of life . &quot;
for me it is the most important thing to feel myself in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
&quot; sorry I &apos;m going to be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago . &quot;
and I am not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn against an increase of suicide among the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran
Iran &apos;s Ah@@ ra@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; since the last few months , there has been a strong increase in suicide attacks . &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was made available by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ ra@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; the self @-@ burning of a man , called J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 , revers@@ ed the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran , which is marked by poverty and unemployment , into the spotlight . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
&quot; he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability to pay for his family , so Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ ra@@ z and remain anonymous . &quot;
a video shared on YouTube kept the moments after he had ign@@ ited himself .
&quot; some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; according to local sources , the burns were so strong that the doctors could do nothing . &quot;
he died shortly afterwards .
&quot; it was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi @-@ minority , and activists on the spot warn that even more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Ham@@ id manifest@@ o , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , Sa@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - hang@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers who felt hel@@ pless and unable to follow their families due to their persecution by the Iranian government , hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families . &quot;
&quot; Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi are suffering from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region , based in which a large part of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community living in Iran has been sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis that makes it hard for the indigenous Arab population to deny their livel@@ ih@@ oods . &quot;
&quot; a century ago , the Arab ancest@@ or was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i monarchy assumed power and in 1925 attempts to end ethnic autonomy in Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran and some of the most profitable and valuable areas for Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy is still developing only slowly , and the native population gets little of this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime systematically refuses Ah@@ ra@@ zi @-@ Arab@@ ians to create jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries . &quot;
&quot; the government has also built a variety of dam@@ s that diver@@ t water from the Arabic areas into the Persian areas , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie . &quot;
&quot; these dam@@ s have only led to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness caused by drought , and destroying local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry . &quot;
the unemployment rate among the Arab a@@ haw@@ zi youth increased to 81 % .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general director for co@@ operatives , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is who are looking for a job , completed a primary school , completed 55 % of secondary school , and 45 % have a university degree . &quot;
systematic strategy ... aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ hi@@ mo@@ i , an Iranian gene@@ alo@@ gical human rights activ@@ ist with resi@@ ding in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of suicide among young Ah@@ wa@@ zi men . &quot;
the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans emerging in Ah@@ ra@@ z and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process :
&quot; since function@@ aries and institutions do not prefer to hire Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their livel@@ ihood outside their homeland . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their first and last name in order to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ wa@@ zi and so be employed , because even Arabic names are not tolerated at the workplace , let alone the speaking of the Arabic language or wearing Arabic clothes . &quot;
&quot; given the circumstances surrounding the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi , human rights activists sm@@ ash alarm before the situation becomes explosive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world w@@ akes up and takes note of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is prev@@ ent@@ able .

&quot; why I don &apos;t identify with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tional &quot;
detail of a photo . recorded by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . released under the CC@@ 0 Creative Com@@ mons license .
the following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the website of Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
&quot; when I say that I am not a feminist , many women - especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - react with fru@@ stration . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we should generally be all fem@@ inists .
&quot; for example , despite the same education , women still earn less money than men . &quot;
women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women sooner or later encounter a glass ceiling in various areas of life , and that discrimination on the basis of sex is still spreading across the many different countries and beliefs . &quot;
all of this is aware and known to me .
&quot; I am convinced , and I suffer double and triple . &quot;
I am a black woman .
&quot; yet : when I come to speak on skin colour , on racism , on black c@@ is women , on black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; when I mention how we have always been ab@@ used with racism and discrimination , both in and out of feminist movement , many white fem@@ inists decide to remain silent . &quot;
&quot; however , they all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; lift up their voices and sing &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord , &quot; to achieve equality ( some ) of women . &quot;
but they do not want to talk that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence there is an institution@@ alised form of rac@@ ist motivated violence that we are subjected to black women in a tw@@ o@@ fold manner .
or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and places of origin earn less than white men and women .
&quot; black girls and girls with a migration background often refer to school as white girls , due to obvious integration problems . &quot;
&quot; or that women in black spheres and women are exposed to a higher risk of mig@@ r@@ atory backgrounds , to suffer domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , I want all the women , all men and all men of every skin color have the same rights ; on the other hand , I can not join a movement in whose center the white woman stands , who refuses to take injusti@@ ces in her mind , which refers both to sex as well as on the skin color of a person . &quot;
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my membership in a white @-@ feminist @-@ oriented sphere that has rejected me and countless other black women over and over again .
&quot; So@@ jour@@ ner compla@@ ined in her speech in 18@@ 51 : &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; and I too refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a de@@ human@@ ised and margin@@ alized being in a historical sense . &quot;
&quot; I refuse to join groups who , in addition , absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropri@@ ation to promote their ego@@ centric program . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of over@@ lap of skin colour and gender , as some of them continue to mention the importance of black women for the feminist movement , no matter how many black women attempt to honour them for the better . &quot;
&quot; although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different backgrounds a home and to isol@@ ate themselves from the white femin@@ ism , there is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in its name . &quot;
&quot; I prefer to release myself completely from femin@@ ism and join the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman , rather than focusing on a white @-@ feminist paradigm , which is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a new phenomenon . &quot;
now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and go into the spheres that are created by us for us .
&quot; Cl@@ an Hudson We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ cana , possibly : rec@@ la@@ iming clock ( e.g. : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ismus : as we rec@@ ap@@ ture ourselves ) speaks of how we can defend ourselves in this way , in which they can also create spaces where the cultural , spiritual , spiritual , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped which constitute the black woman . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists will immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself of the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the feminist movement by which the black woman is affected . &quot;
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can lift black women and women from other cultures because I exist in this paradigm .
&quot; due to my dark skin and my being &apos;s existence , I am recognized as a woman as part of this paradigm . &quot;
&quot; I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment where my life has neither gone over nor ignored , nor rejected . &quot;

in this documentary by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church .
&quot; I wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was still a child , &quot; Mus@@ a tells . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the NGO Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - who is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summ@@ ari@@ zes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work on a question : &quot; if we had no water any more , how would we survive ? &quot; &quot;
&quot; this video was produced , filmed and edited for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film based in Er@@ bil , Iraq , in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; the focus of their work lies on persecuted , little not@@ e@@ worthy sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , with which help oppressed communities can tell their stories in their own way . &quot;

the following article is the shortened and edited version of the article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence Against Women in Paraguay &quot; by c@@ tural . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ts@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # gra@@ lich@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) reported on the wave of violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the affected people .
&quot; a police commission@@ er told A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner , who had become violent against her . &quot;
&quot; since the end of their relationship , some time has el@@ ap@@ sed and the police said that their statement would be put on the files , but more can &apos;t be done . &quot;
&quot; when another woman appeared to Bal@@ bu@@ ena for mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment , the A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez &apos;s accurate display was also useful . &quot;
&quot; a few days later , the second woman moved back to her ad . &quot;
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; in general , if women refund ads , they generally do not receive support from the state . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse . this also explains why only 20 % of all women , who admit to being victims of violence , report to the law enforcement authorities at all . &quot;
&quot; clu@@ b@@ 1 strikes and statisti@@ c 2 In@@ visible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that does not unter@@ lie 3 Paraguay Law : good approach , poor implementation strikes and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to determine how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , researcher on gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ dison , a social science research institution in Paraguay . &quot;
the available numbers are however alar@@ ming .
&quot; in 2015 , the District At@@ tor@@ ney Office held 9@@ 600 advertisements for domestic violence . 70 % of them were violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
&quot; there were more than 5,000 ads for domestic violence in the courts of peace . here too 86 % of the ads of women came . &quot;
&quot; in the advertisements , 40 % of women reported that they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of mental abuse . &quot;
but these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
&quot; according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; &quot; on every woman who is reported in Paraguay for psych@@ ic abuse , 9 women who do not do this . &quot;
&quot; on every woman who is ref@@ unded because of physical abuse , two women who do not do this , &quot; she explained at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; since genocide is not an own crime in Paraguay , law enforcement agencies cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; by August 2016 alone , journalists numbered at least 12 cases of murder in the country . &quot;
the Co@@ ordin@@ ator for Human Rights in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases in which women were murdered by their current or former partners .
&quot; according to their estimates , every ten days in Paraguay died due to violence by men . &quot;

&quot; invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment , and a legal system that does not under@@ mine &quot;
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she called him the names of all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do it , but then she said . this should always be regre@@ t@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos . but for two years she bore the psychological violence , one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult recognizable : &quot;
I would never have thought that I would once become a victim of abuse .
&quot; when I read about it before , I always thought that this happens only to women who are too sub@@ servi@@ ent because they are deceived by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about the mal@@ treatment by Carlos Vera .
&quot; without nam@@ ing names , she wrote articles on Facebook where she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated them . &quot;
&quot; many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically as to whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse . &quot;
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had fallen from Carlos so long and didn &apos;t leave it earlier .
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse would at least have a certain complic@@ ity .
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , who is not from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner abuse her . &quot;
&quot; Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te Cre@@ o network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) , which consists of women who are all in some way victims of abuse . &quot;
&quot; in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Victori@@ as case everything started with mental mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
her aff@@ lu@@ ent partner even managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he started beating them .
&quot; Victoria &apos;s ads with the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives , they did not receive any support . &quot;
&quot; she led a trial against her former partner , who developed into an im@@ penet@@ r@@ able legal fight between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner . &quot;
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach to poor implementation
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws , which are very good , but not applied . &quot;
&quot; the display of abuse is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in the application of the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a draft law was discussed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Parliament under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # for you ) . &quot;
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non@@ Uni@@ e@@ Wen@@ iger ) are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original draft of the law stipul@@ ates that Fem@@ ici@@ d has to declare and punish har@@ sh@@ er as it is already in the neighboring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; so the bill was modified in some points to also win the de@@ pu@@ ties for the law , which feared that the way for the de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions is prohibited , which is currently prohibited in Paraguay and will be punished with up to five years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the original bill envis@@ aged , the majority of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs that the victims of violence must wear themselves , if they just want to refund and receive a safe accommodation to impose the state . &quot;
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it :
&quot; in Paraguay , mal@@ treatment is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships . &quot;
&quot; here , a re@@ thinking must take place , so that violence is no longer seen as something normal . &quot;
&quot; whoever is silent in the face of these facts , complic@@ ates and contributes to the fact that the perpetr@@ ators are offen@@ ded . &quot;
we have to refund the ad until ill @-@ treatment is no longer considered normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . before that , parts of the law had been changed . among other things , a passage was cancelled , which the partners called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence . &quot;
the opinions about the changes are coming apart .
the reconciliation section was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack its victim again .
&quot; the cancellation of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; of parts of the law , however , is regarded as a great set@@ back . &quot;

independent media in Oman one year after the ban on a newspaper continues to attack attacks
&quot; this website was blocked because of a decision by the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; on the homepage of the banned newspaper &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; more than a year ago , the Italian authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their reporting on corruption in the sul@@ t@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison , where he is serving a one @-@ year jail sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and tried , but later released . &quot;
&quot; Oman has been governed since 1970 by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power after he had dismissed his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , through a coup d &quot; é@@ tat . &quot;
&quot; since then , in addition to his role as the only sul@@ tan , he has been suffering the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander , Minister of Finance , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; Sultan &apos;s rule is marked by the persistent efforts of security forces , especially domestic sec@@ rec@@ y , civil liber@@ ties , including freedom of press , restric@@ ting and torture human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ g@@ gers and other activists . &quot;
&quot; the authorities will systematically restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights and prevent citizens , including activists , to express their views on public affairs of the country , such as corruption in public authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and the incar@@ cer@@ ation of three of its editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country . &quot;
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper reported since its establishment in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
&quot; on July 28 , 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , arrested in the paper on 26 July 2016 , an article entitled &quot; High @-@ ranking parties joining hands of justice . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials were accused of having put pressure on judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to raise a verdict in a case of inheritance . &quot;
&quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n of July 26 , 2016 with a report on the title page with the inscription : &quot; high @-@ ranking parties tie the hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a member of the editorial board , was invited by the ISS to the Special Department and arrested on arrival by the security forces . &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2016 , the ISS had the deputy editor @-@ in @-@ chief You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief after al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is arrest . &quot;
&quot; the newspaper was closed in@@ definitely after the Information Minister had given the statement that &quot; the publication and dis@@ semination of the newspaper is prohibited on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i took place before the court in Mas@@ kat . &quot;
the court sentenced the three journalists to jail and also ordered the final closing of the newspaper .
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were , among other things , convic@@ ted of distur@@ b@@ ance of public order , abuse of the Internet , and &quot; under@@ mining the state of the state . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition , Al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of a prohibition of publication and de@@ fam@@ ation . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es in the amount of $ 3000 ( $ 7@@ 800 ) .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year of imprisonment and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he found the use of &quot; an information network for the distribution of material which could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
&quot; for Al Abr@@ i , a security deposit was set in the amount of $ 5000 ( $ 13@@ 000 ) and was released from prison on 22 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the Appe@@ als Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ Abr@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to six months in prison for a year and al @-@ ma@@ am@@ ari . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j remains in prison where he h@@ ates his one @-@ year prison sentence .
the Appe@@ als Court also raised the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; newspaper .
&quot; despite the decision of the court to allow Az@@ am@@ n to return , the newspaper continues to be exposed to attacks by the government of India . &quot;
&quot; on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , with which the Minister once again opposed the decision of the Court of Appe@@ al to re @-@ publish the publication of the newspaper . &quot;
the continuing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which in Oman in recent times the freedom of the press was viol@@ ated .
&quot; further injuries include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent journal M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper in the country to cease its operation . &quot;
&quot; due to the continuing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the government authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press . &quot;
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the Indian authorities to :
1 . You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally release ;
2. to create a secure environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n so that their journalists can pursue their work ;
3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
&quot; 4 . in all circumstances ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman have un@@ hin@@ dered their legitimate human rights work without fear of ret@@ ali@@ ation measures , including judicial ch@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ governmental and non @-@ governmental organisation that supports human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ g@@ gers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and neighbouring countries by promoting freedom of expression and association , and the right to gather , support and protect themselves peac@@ efully . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , mapping takes place with his consent &quot;
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media . this is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on site : on the one hand there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the special medical need on the African continent .
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have much more serious effects in Africa &apos;s poor@@ est countries than elsewhere , and lack of investment to research these diseases by drug companies is a major problem . &quot;
&quot; secondly , research carried out by African scientists helps build own research capacities in Africa . a major role in science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Central Laboratory at the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
&quot; he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia in the 1990s , especially when the AIDS epide@@ mic showed the first serious impact on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for studying in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as a post @-@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he conducted research on the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the Serbian healthcare system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about the mis@@ understanding of the media about this research . &quot;
( discla@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier : right now , the focus of my work is on the application of research results . in doing so , I support the Serbian national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; in addition , I have just started a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens . &quot;
GM : what do you think are the most important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only implement solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; this has to change , otherwise we will always remain bene@@ fici@@ aries instead of being cre@@ ators themselves . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get are often not well used in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here . &quot;
GM : where does funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are sponsored differently .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or go here , because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot;
GM : what is the research infrastructure ?
what are the obstacles in your routine research work you did not have before ?
&quot; RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money , a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; lab material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
GM : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
&quot; RW : there is already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods . &quot;
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; GM : how big is your opinion according to the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on , and how can we support the development ? &quot;
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there is a need for special academic education , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer sciences , big data , research into space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and con@@ ta@@ gious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly . &quot;
&quot; GM : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa , based on your experience ? &quot;
&quot; RW : often , it is the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here . &quot;
the system that perio@@ dic@@ als make articles accessible only against payment ( the so @-@ called Pay@@ wall ) also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research .
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change global food production
&quot; this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine reported on solutions for environmental problems worldwide . &quot;
Frank Mort@@ on has been breeding salad for the USA since the 1980s .
&quot; its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ dis , the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space . &quot;
&quot; for almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work has been limited only by his own resour@@ c@@ efulness and the question of how many types of let@@ tu@@ ce he can get . &quot;
but at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he couldn &apos;t use them further for breeding .
&quot; patents do not only apply to single varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green tone or cri@@ mp@@ ed leaves . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cereals or car@@ rots . due to this trend , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia of old tradition , Mort@@ on keeps growing let@@ tu@@ ce , but he now needs longer , since his work is becoming more and more complicated by ever increasing restrictions . &quot;
&quot; it is like lying in a river a b@@ oul@@ der , around which I have to ride down . &quot;
&quot; so we have to do that now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think that these patents go too far on salads . &quot;
&quot; and if they stand before the court , no one can breed a new type of salad , because all the characteristics are already patented . &quot;
&quot; however , it is very careful and endeav@@ ours to not use any material protected as intellectual property . &quot;
he has also joined a movement growing more and more in the United States and around the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( Open Source Bre@@ eding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Roman let@@ tu@@ ce of the variety Out@@ red@@ ym in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station . there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space .

&quot; it is no coincidence that this name sounds like that , as if the movement from the IT area comes from and not from the field of plant breeding . &quot;
&quot; the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for open source seed ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copy@@ righ@@ ted software . &quot;
it has been created to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and are thus permanently usable for plant breeders .
&quot; within the framework of the initiative , called Os@@ si briefly , US breeders can commit to the use of other bred seeds . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; breeders allow only others who buy their seed , breed it to breed their own varieties , and do not immediately sow - two aspects that are forbidden or prescribed by many plant patents . &quot;
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014 .
glo@@ omy outlook
&quot; Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , a professor at the University of Wis@@ con@@ sin @-@ Ma@@ dison and Os@@ si , is in control of the seed and the ability to breed new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; according to them , seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try not to use the latter or only little by breeding seed with natural resistance . &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphasizes that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement does not concern genetically modified plants .
&quot; all types of plants could be patented whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from organic farming or not . &quot; in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control of the seed , &quot; he says , taking into account the increasingly common mer@@ gers in the global agricultural industry , as it is , for example , on farmers markets . &quot;
food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot;
&quot; members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative agree to keep their seed available free of charge , as opposed to patent seed and plant characteristics . &quot;
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
&quot; Os@@ si supporters argue that the future of food provision is at risk , as the available gene pool is constantly shr@@ inking due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material which is therefore always available . &quot;
&quot; Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , director director of Os@@ si , has worked in her PhD thesis on genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about one third of all v@@ ets were protected as intellectual property , making it difficult for plant breeders either not or only difficult to use . &quot;
&quot; there are not yet such estimates for other plants , but experts such as Lu@@ by suspect that mas@@ ked crops such as wheat are patented in an even greater style than salad or car@@ rots . &quot;
a question of view
&quot; plants are bred in such a way that they have specific desirable traits - from those by which their taste or colour improves to such , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
&quot; opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders dec@@ lines by more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much worse than ever due to climate change . &quot;
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to spokesperson C@@ arly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to acknow@@ le@@ dges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gen@@ banks and cooperation with institutions such as the United States Department of Agriculture , the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity . &quot;
&quot; however , it contradic@@ ts the notion that intellectual property belongs to other breeders , as &quot; &quot; patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expi@@ red . &quot;
often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method .
&quot; such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but encourages them by providing more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot;
&quot; Mort@@ on sees that differently : 20 years to wait , until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly does not promote innovations . &quot;
&quot; if you have to wait so long for breeding of plants adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you would have lost the fight . &quot;
&quot; however , the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources have always been a common good and continue to remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us . &quot;
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; this is what drives us , and it is impossible for us to continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; in total , Mort@@ on interfer@@ es with the concept of patented plant features : &quot; we don &apos;t really create the characteristics themselves . &quot;
the plants form them themselves and as breeders we have no idea how the plants do this .
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant bree@@ der in the U.S. state O@@ reg@@ on and Os@@ si Executive Board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; whoever breeds a variety breeds also its own values into it . &quot;
&quot; those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , are needed for their cultivation of mass her@@ bi@@ cides , bred in its varieties this concept of agriculture . &quot;
my concept is exact opposite . &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such firms move on international markets , but smaller than Z. B. Mon@@ san@@ to ) , they manage most of the smaller seed companies , even without patents to survive - either they reject the patent or they consider it too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding , or both is the case . &quot;

&quot; Mort@@ on also believes that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents : &quot; it looks like I am working with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than a company that patented . &quot;
&quot; I constantly need new material for my catalogue because I know that my competitors are selling my varieties for themselves in a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent , one is protected from competition for 20 years . &quot;
&quot; although the US seems to be a leader in &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept is now spreading rapidly throughout the world . &quot;
&quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ) , which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources , is working together with farmers and helps them grow new varieties that meet certain requirements . &quot;
it also supports them to come to &quot; open source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
&quot; the German Association Agre@@ ements is working on an open source license , which is ultimately a more formal and legally binding form of Os@@ si &apos;s commitment to breeders in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ( regulations for breeding differ from country to country , hence the Os@@ si obligation cannot be easily adopted one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conventional bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . &quot;
&quot; however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is at the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; open source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards seed pat@@ enting . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos;s programme for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems , explains that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems , which is scheduled to drop the official launch next year . &quot;
&quot; an association of environmental and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non@@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on erosion , technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database of seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food - has published a report that farmers have the opportunity to come to seed , exchange and improve seed policy so that a stable supply of food can be ensured . &quot;
&quot; the report also highlights the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection between the Lu@@ by von Os@@ si hopes that more people will soon be recognized . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has , above all , taken care of where and how something is cultivated , and seed systems have hardly played a role here , &quot; Lu@@ by says . &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that even more is behind their food . &quot;

human rights organization and blog are the latest cens@@ orship targets in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still ban content on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
&quot; on the weekend around the 5th of August , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world . &quot;
&quot; in August , the network published an opinion on Facebook , which sharply critici@@ zed the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts of human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; even though it has never been so difficult to keep track of these objectives , it has never been as important as it is now . AN@@ HR@@ I confirms that all technical possibilities are exhausted to overcome the block@@ age and not to surrender . we insist on fulfilling our task . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ HR@@ I is considered to be the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arab @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and Qatar originating from Qatar due to alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot; &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organization of wave of site barriers to victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i is one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language htt@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
&quot; in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt . &quot;
Zi@@ ada used his blog to spread columns and articles that he writes in Egypt not accessible websites and media .
&quot; now the blog , which he directed to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government , became the target of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blo@@ gger , the provider who is also home to Zi@@ adas &apos;s blog , is still available . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported about the student protests and recorded a video how police exercised physical violence against two students . &quot;
his articles revol@@ ve mainly around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada expressed himself by the government and reflected what this means for him : &quot;
&quot; blocking the blogs is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be meaningful for the world , it is for me for two reasons : &quot;
&quot; I have succeeded in giving me the feeling of a state of siege . an arrest , a murder , sum@@ mons to the National Security Council , the lock blog and any other website for which I was working . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) You have proven that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have influence , even if only on a small audience . &quot;
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to post items to circum@@ vent cens@@ orship .
&quot; but now that they have locked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the brave go the way to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) , Egyptian authorities locked up 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August 133 . this resulted in technical tests in networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and E@@ ti@@ sal@@ at . &quot;
&quot; also documented the blocking of providers , through the reloc@@ ation of boarding facilities and private surfing possible , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s ) &quot;
af@@ te reported in her research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of websites that V@@ P@@ N@@ s are offering began . &quot;
such practice indicates the government &apos;s intention to continue to block and filter content that Egyptian users could have access .
&quot; in addition , the situation is exac@@ erb@@ ated by the fact that the decision @-@ making decisions are taken behind closed doors , which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis with which it can proceed against these actions in court . &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with cens@@ orship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .

&quot; day after day newspapers in Brazil report with dark head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motives . &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old in school , &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer is murdered in Rio de Janeiro &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; Thi@@ eves rob@@ bed the dru@@ g@@ store with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tim@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , nav@@ y and air@@ waves to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the power wave 2017 in Rio has reached the highest level for 10 years . &quot;
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; at least find the manager of a local newspaper .
&quot; on 16 August , the &quot; Extra &quot; newspaper , known for its detailed coverage of violence in Rio , published the editorial , &quot; This is not normal , &quot; in which she announced a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published .
the paper thus explained the motives for their decision :
&quot; it will continue to report on crimes committed in every major city in the world such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sex crime , etc . all that happens from civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the ru@@ bri@@ c &quot; war in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way of calling : this is not normal ! &quot;
this is the only alternative so that as journalists we don &apos;t close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ e@@ des , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , said that this decision is no reason for pride but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
it is probably the only newspaper on the whole world with a ru@@ bri@@ c in a country that does not recognize the war at all .
&quot; in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper declares that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro , there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organisations . &quot;
&quot; in the editorial , the newspaper writes on : &quot;
&quot; we are aware that a war discourse , if it is distorted , can also be used to disgu@@ ise cru@@ el@@ ty of the police that shoots and then asks questions . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Ma@@ fia and its partners . &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it benefits ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , the journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira argue against the violence as &quot; &quot; war &quot; . &quot; this is , in her opinion , a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to hold responsible persons in the police . &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as shown in the analysis of the military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ compl@@ ying neglect of public service . &quot;
&quot; as a reminder , the state of Rio de Janeiro is larger than its capital . &quot;

&quot; to mark Rio de Janeiro as &quot; the most violent place in Brazil , &quot; Cec@@ í@@ lia is wrong : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics of 2015 in the north and the northeast of the country . these are the most up @-@ to @-@ date available data . &quot;
none of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; looking at the mur@@ ders per federal state , Rio is in place 16 , &quot; she writes . &quot;
&quot; the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , which , as Cec@@ í@@ lia stresses , has been repe@@ ating the state &apos;s security policy for years . &quot;
&quot; this security policy also included the creation of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit established by the state of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to conquer a fav@@ ela by using a massive police custody and to permanently station@@ ed a unit there . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of forci@@ ble death cases . however , for several years , the U@@ PP has been increasingly under fire after several reports of har@@ ass@@ ment and repres@@ sions against the poor communities that should actually protect the newly created police unit . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , the journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux quoted from one of his articles from the year 2010 , in which he explains why violence in Rio does not conform to the criteria defined by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also has serious consequences for the people . &quot;
&quot; this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a civilian is a sharp point in the countryside and becomes an object for &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost bul@@ lets . &quot; &quot;
&quot; war back or forth , fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as continue to suffer in Rio . &quot;
&quot; one week ago , the police cleared the mountain with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a sal@@ es@@ man died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter . &quot;

to stay alive : besi@@ eg@@ ed Syrians learn to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot of the advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly due to the Assad regime against loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to World@@ watch , a joint initiative of the Peace organization PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ li@@ b . &quot;
&quot; the East Gh@@ out@@ a region is particularly affected , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 demanded hundreds of civilians . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition are based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was perpet@@ rated by the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these rebel @-@ controlled areas have been under siege from Damascus , which led to the need for smu@@ g@@ gling food on locally produced or through tunnels and control points . &quot;
&quot; due to the years of block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and academ@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , how they can plant their own fung@@ i as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ ni@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; mushrooms do not belong to the traditional food planted in Syria , and are very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their nutritional value makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besi@@ eg@@ ed east Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the Di@@ re@@ kt of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we chose to cultivate fung@@ i because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because it is possible to plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices , which has been fighting for three years to make this project known and expressed its relief that it now gains more and more promin@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; in order to collect money for the initiative , we use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ ni@@ da . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to provide 125 families with knowledge of planting mushrooms , according to Dr. Lei@@ la to Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the constitution of this article , they have achieved over 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 € , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do until Monday , September 4th 2017 . &quot;
the initiative relies on generators that keep temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
&quot; because of the shortage of fuel , locally produced plastics are used in plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they began with the &quot; production of fung@@ al seeds originating from the regions &quot; before checking their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption .
&quot; then they planted a small mushroom courtyard in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a bigger bowl . and so on . &quot;
&quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region &quot; . &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months they have spread mushrooms throughout East Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach the people mushroom breeding for various reasons &quot; &quot; : break of the siege . &quot;
providing a new food source on the market .
&quot; spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food lef@@ to@@ vers ( such as paper , tea , coffee set , cardboard , etc ) for the extraction of new foods . &quot;
&quot; creation of new jobs , especially for women who work at home . &quot;
creating new jobs for people with disabilities who are tied to their homes .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea around the world , so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and the siege are visible . &quot;
we want our experience to be inspiring people in crisis areas and we can help mankind .

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the 2017 fires
several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many districts in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were ra@@ ging in the north of Portugal in the week before .
forty @-@ two people died and about 70 were injured following the fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the fact that the government proclaimed the last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in Gali@@ cia region in Spain where there were 4 deaths .
&quot; it is estimated that there have been more than 500 fire out@@ breaks , spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages . &quot;
&quot; in June , Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande acquired a similar tragedy , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured . &quot;
&quot; according to the European forest surveillance system , which monitors forest areas by satellite photographs alone in 2017 in Portugal approximately 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned - an area of the size of the Lisbon district . &quot;
&quot; so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation , there is no fire in only 4 districts . &quot;
&quot; the whole of Portugal burns in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ mer - nat@@ a , ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15th , 2017 &quot;
some of Twitter users shared pictures :

numerous videos spread on the net and show images that allow better insights into what is happening :
the fores@@ eeable tragedy
the aim of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state .
people wondered why civil protection was not able to contain the extent of the tragedy as far as possible
Jo@@ ão Sover@@ al of the Con@@ federation of Far@@ mers of Portugal declared the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
&quot; after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , roads and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing . &quot;
this Sunday they did not do this anywhere : there are dozens of reports from open roads enclosed by fire .
&quot; in the woods of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy would have happened as in June , as the roads were locked very late . &quot;
&quot; in addition , construction permits in locations with high fire risk are questioned . &quot;
&quot; a wide @-@ reaching proposal for the forest reform , introduced by the government for serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment . &quot;
&quot; the government introduced a sl@@ ack@@ ening of the law which allowed the construction activity from case to case , if the applicant had a means of self @-@ defence - that was an open backdoor , so that everything could be built , &quot; Jo@@ ão Sor@@ row continues in the same article of the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organisation Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus trees , trees made of easily combus@@ tible wood , spread like in a vi@@ cious circle , after fires of this kind . &quot;
&quot; these problems add that the website of civil protection from Portugal on 15 and 16 October , when people were looking for information or attempted to contact relatives offline . &quot;
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : they used the own civil protection data using the application f@@ og@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
&quot; the project was founded in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina in order to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ g@@ ade and was so crucial in this fat@@ eful weekend in October that the servers were not able to withstand the ons@@ lau@@ ght of the 400@@ ,000 users that followed the fires . &quot;
even the founder asked for help :

&quot; two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups that had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus Afghanistan had become a country of terror and despair . &quot;
&quot; at this time A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , was in the G@@ haz@@ ni Province in Central Africa for the last time together with his family at dinner . &quot;
&quot; even though his mother did not say so at that time , she knew that she would no longer see her son - perhaps even more . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , the boy should break up . &quot;
his un@@ cle would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers .

for a few years he worked in a coal mine . the work was heavy and made him sick .
&quot; then he took what was left of his low wages , and went to Iran . once again he found himself in a foreign country together with other refugees and dra@@ gged sacks with mort@@ ars that were heavier than he himself , in order to earn his livel@@ ihood . &quot;
&quot; back then , like today , Afghan refugees in Iran have been characterised by poverty and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; &quot; said A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site where we also worked . &quot;
there were no services and no heating . we hung n@@ ylon in front of the open windows so that we did not freeze at night .
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ k left his life without papers in Iran and made himself ready for the journey to Europe . &quot;
&quot; during the dangerous crossing on the sea , he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ k came to Italy in 2002 . &quot;
&quot; some time A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , fell asleep in parks , and went to a church who distributed food to the needy twice a day . &quot;
&quot; although it is true that due to relatively high twin rates , Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers . it is true , however , that the conditions that asylum seekers are in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot;
the Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe human rights organisation writes that the system &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency .
the large majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in the more than 3000 &quot; special reception centres . &quot; these are impro@@ vised institutions in the hands of un@@ qualified and uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able personnel .
&quot; according to Italian law , asylum seekers can only be admitted to a reception centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - which can be applied for months after the registration of the asylum application . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who don &apos;t have money for accommodation can either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street . &quot;
so there was also A@@ shar@@ af .
&quot; but A@@ shar@@ af , however , helped to free himself from these conditions . &quot;
&quot; after several years of working in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af was putting his entire savings into the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice . &quot;
this was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a quick snack .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now the theme of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
&quot; the film won the Venice City Award 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes , and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to in@@ official estimates , some 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; in recent years some of Afgh@@ ans have ar@@ isen , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy by the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes . &quot;
the Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Pad@@ ua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna and a sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ a &apos;s goals , however , extend far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retail , and aim to return to the country which he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where there is a risk , there are also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I can &apos;t live happily when I know my people are suffering .
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and have to get the same possibilities as everyone else .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af also for@@ ges plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; so they can sell their crop sur@@ pl@@ uses in the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end there are stability and prosperity . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af made this journey himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this journey .
&quot; citizen report : bills of bills from Egypt allow the elimination of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in custody . &quot;
he reported on the evacu@@ ation of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo which prot@@ ested against the de@@ composition of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

&quot; global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ tizen report is an international snapshot that shows challenges , wins and emerging trends in global internet rights &quot;
the Egyptian parliament has reviewed a bill that fores@@ ees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registering with a government authority .
&quot; in order to be able to use social networks , users must register within six months following the successful legal decision on the authority &apos;s website , stating their full name and their ID number . &quot;
those who miss this step could be sentenced to up to six months &quot; imprisonment or the withdrawal of a pen@@ al payment .
&quot; the law , which was promoted by sixty members of Parliament , is currently ahead of the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; in May , another MP submitted a proposal to introduce harder pun@@ ishments for the insul@@ ting of the president or senior officials . &quot;
&quot; under Egyptian law , the insul@@ t of the President and state institutions is already pun@@ ishable . however , under the legislation it would be prosec@@ uted with prison and fin@@ es , as legal experts at the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; if the law is passed , this can mean three years imprisonment for the convic@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photographed violence against demonstr@@ ators who fought against the military coup , which had led to the inauguration of elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan was waiting , like more than 700 protest participants who had been arrested on the same incident , four years in jail for a date of trial . &quot;
&quot; recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to the May 20 , because the prison administration , according to the human rights groups , failed to bring the accused from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan threatened the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree on false charges of including ce@@ ase@@ fire , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder . &quot;
&quot; in another case , a criminal tribunal in G@@ iza was acqu@@ itted by two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ sad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their coverage of the pro @-@ Mor@@ si block@@ ade on the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ vi@@ ya square in Cairo . &quot;
&quot; the court also reduced the punishment of journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mu@@ staf@@ a and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested on the previous occasion , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
inter@@ rog@@ ating Tunisi@@ an activists to in@@ feed documents
&quot; Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ rog@@ ation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy Project . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia was chi@@ ef@@ ly inter@@ ro@@ gated to a planned action plan . according to the plan , the President of the Republic explicitly supports a controversial draft bill that would grant business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption , provided that these funds illeg@@ ally returned . &quot;
&quot; this document , published on April 21st at Na@@ wa@@ at &apos;s website , sheds light on how the predic@@ tive plans for the support of the statute will look like . &quot;
Ben G@@ har@@ bia le@@ aned the nam@@ ing of his sources stating article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an press code which ensures journalists the right to protect their sources .
&quot; nevertheless , he appeared in the District Court in Tunis on 9 May as a witness . &quot;
does China want to force the users of social media to present their identity ?
&quot; according to the new provisions of the National Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , users of social media in China need permission before they write or share messages in social media . &quot;
the rules also indicate that the registration with the full real name will be required .
&quot; analysts believe that this will allow the elimination of anonymous comments to be reached within social networks . until now , it is unclear how the authorities will apply these rules . &quot;
Chinese citizens have proposed in social media to enforce these rules only sel@@ ectively in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and independence .

not in Russia !
&quot; in May , the state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app . &quot;
&quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register with the state government as the &quot; Organ@@ izer of Information Dis@@ semination . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this designation is part of a 2014 Act , thanks to which the Russian Government carries out a list of online services that will organize the &quot; publication of the information . &quot; the law also allows the government to be responsible for the removal of content and to force it on request for the delivery of user data . &quot;
&quot; these websites are currently websites like V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ p@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the image board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , e @-@ mail service Mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services . &quot;
Turkish court features lock Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
&quot; a Turkish court decre@@ ed Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the indications , Turkey support the jihadi@@ sts in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication gave an indication that the site was closed because it &quot; &quot; an information source that works together with groups in order to support a policy diffusion campaign against Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time that Turkey blocks the website completely . it is thus , among other things , China , one of the few countries worldwide in which access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
great Britain cannot stop sni@@ ff@@ ing
&quot; after this week in@@ feed documents , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance capabilities that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install Backdoor program which de@@ cryp@@ t data encryption . &quot;
&quot; the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence agencies regarding the proposal , but has left other technology companies and civil population out@@ war@@ dly . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the consultation continues until May 19 . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior . &quot;
