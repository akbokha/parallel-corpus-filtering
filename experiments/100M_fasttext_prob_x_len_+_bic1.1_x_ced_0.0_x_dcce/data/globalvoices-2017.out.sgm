<seg id="1">"although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012, I would now live there for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="4">"like many of my generation I grew up with American movies, I danced to American music, read American authors and run his sport."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly a journalist because of an American movie."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Letter, a fearless reporter who wanted to fill the murderous conspiracy of an oil-magnet as a Jura-student, who wanted to occupy the supreme federal court with judges who were interested in his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free after Method Man," I was as if this is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the USA had only intensified."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said," America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so welcoming, that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very blackish love letter written about its size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">With his opinion he never thinks behind the mountain as one says so beautifully.</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks, like a former colleague expressing it, and declares publicly his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, African American and women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, the people responded to his statements and tuned in droves for him."</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won with the Republican elections was the highest number ever reached by a candidate nominated by the party.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">"who are the Americans, who support this bigotger person, I asked myself?"</seg>
<seg id="21">I couldn't reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">"like my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program that takes up people from around the world, a deeply believing man with whom I was able to talk about Islam and his past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Trumps's view of the world did not agree with that of Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met at our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Trumps Intolerance is also in stark contrast to the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who have been fighting the environment for their lives, and their husband Dave, my host family who treated me like their son."</seg>
<seg id="26">"she still fits the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and my colleagues helped to get used to the complexity of American life."</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew treats, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump cautioned his way to the nominees republican presidential candidate, they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on November 8, 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly white, presided over a man despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt against non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump, because they shared either his racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, I almost broke my heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to designate the Trump voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"to categorize people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful and suggests an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that those voters, of whom the majority are white, voted for Trump, because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they might say that they are still important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe. maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who comments the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down on those who look different than he."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" "whitelash" "(Ü).: according to the whites against all other ethnic groups." "white and Whiplash" "white and whiplash, as the big van Jones named, has killed exactly what America has made so great."</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which belief or background one may always have, America welcomes everyone."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this land chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyan man whose history, as he himself says, would not be possible anywhere else in the world."</seg>
<seg id="44">"with the election Donald Trumps, however, a huge part of the White America promises this promise and says: to hell with multiplicity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11, the white man is back at the helm, they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">"on a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan. "</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd responded with a loud "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"do Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" the crowd roared.</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they cried, and their voices were louder. "</seg>
<seg id="56">"if someone, who is not like you, would have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and vocal "NO"!</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan concluded with the words:" thank God, Mr. Trump, this is not your America. "36 hours later he was corrected."</seg>
<seg id="59">"the land, for whom his son had fallen, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"this is now Trumps Land, the news said."</seg>
<seg id="61">"all the people who look like Mr. Khan, couldn't find any place in this new America."</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What did the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero commune in the province of Oaxaca together with the children of the Paraguaan city of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">"the music played in both places not only changed the life of the children, but also a very close connection with..."</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the trash</seg>
<seg id="72">"Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill, only 16 kilometres south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town that is very popular among tourists, but worlds away from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine."</seg>
<seg id="73">"for several years now, La banda de Música (music bande) has been playing in the community: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way of overcoming poverty with their musical instruments."</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest in the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">"the community, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its abuse of drugs and gangs of gangs."</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a chance meeting with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered the youth a rare hope for hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">"the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:"</seg>
<seg id="79">"as soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"you always come laughing and play with shiny eyes and play in the hustle you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, bongos and the conga."</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from rubbish</seg>
<seg id="82">"more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village located at the top of the largest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguay's capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material:"</seg>
<seg id="83">"music with remanufactured instruments made of local solid waste materials, made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recycler under the direction of Favio Chávez began to transform parts of the waste into instruments."</seg>
<seg id="84">"instruments imitate violins, violas, cellos, double bass, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and drums all made out of the trash."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music, as well as music from the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in an article by the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls:"</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearse and we had to teach in the same place where the parents worked in the trash. children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as Favio something which he had never seen before: a violin rendered from apostasy.</seg>
<seg id="89">"today, there is a whole orchestra playing on instruments made of recycled material and which is called The Recycled Orchestra."</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) records the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates about one billion tons of waste each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">"those who live with him and from him are the poorest - like the people in Cateura, Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring drama from trash to music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra has played his music even before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries demonstrate how technology and teamwork can successfully fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that combats wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">"this post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine reported specifically about international, practical solutions for environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-release takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices for the common use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa, it was known at that time that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberia before it visited the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">"the East African countries were, accordingly, upset and inclined to welcome a criminal offenders of this kind at their coasts."</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles were quickly mobilizing against the ship. they refused to buy one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permit."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that just refused everything," "recalls Benedict Kiilu, a senior management of the Kenyan fishing authority. he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at that time."</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was not able to catch fish there."</seg>
<seg id="105">"finally, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars in Liberia, because of pillage of the country's fish stocks."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 launched by NRO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal fishing)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"apart from Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries that the premier had driven out of their waters at that time."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" with this, we have eight countries that are like-minded and work together. they exchange information and stand up to each other where it comes to illegal fishing, "says Tony Long, director of the Pew Charitable Trust project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project provides FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="109">"illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, hence it is extremely difficult to detect. thus, illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing in regions."</seg>
<seg id="110">The deliberate disregard of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected can harm the illegal fishing ecosystems that have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">"while actions against illegal fishing were once hampered by bureaucratic hurdles and also through the snail-tempo, with the information between individual countries, the actions are happening in real time, with trackable at FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"there, for example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news about suspicious activities or details that were noticed or experienced during a harbour inspection."</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i is also very attentive to the activities of ships when they move on the open seas by means of satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">"this allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in forbidden areas. also, suspicious routes may be detected - such as those indicating that a ship loads its caught fish on the way to other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"ideally, such investigations can indicate whether the participating vessels have a fishing license where they were on the road and possibly whether they have a penal code."</seg>
<seg id="116">"on the basis of this information, countries that are opposed to illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such vessels in their ports, which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay sanctions, as in the case of the Prime Minister."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "there are considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is not profitable anymore."</seg>
<seg id="118">"this is what we want to achieve," "says Per Erik Bergh, senior director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm engaged in the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the already mentioned platform was created to recover estimated 20 million USD to lost revenue, which the eight members of the HISH-i network lost every year because of the illegal fishermen entering East African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">"East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, which attracts the region's commercial fishing from around the world. among these are also illegal fishermen."</seg>
<seg id="122">"their practices include like sailing under false flag, fake license papers, specifying fantasy names, fishing-protected species and fishing in nature reserves."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they deliberately exploit the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of an unbroken-organised control system," "says Long." "in the past, a ship could fish illegally and a country could then say 'You cannot run my port'."</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say "Come to me." and this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="125">"until now, the closed front is working."</seg>
<seg id="126">"since its inception, FISH-i has participated in more than 30 studies of suspected ships."</seg>
<seg id="127">It has exposed criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has pursued and found fleeting ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">"as a result of his cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority to combat crime, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing over large distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime, "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="130">It builds a system that will help FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly evolving, also helps to track down the illegal ships that would like to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" illegal fishers use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position, "says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO, which also deals with fishery data and provides technical support with FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="134">"some of the ships switch off their automatic identification systems, for example, so they can no longer be ordered from satellites."</seg>
<seg id="135">"therefore, Copeland helps build a system that connects different levels of information. FISH-i aims to help you find criminals operating with greater precision."</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the SkyTruth, believes that."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, Skytruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Marine Protection Organization Oceana: a platform that offers satellite data and means that each trackable ship's position can be displayed worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "get together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing - that simply makes sense," "he says." "here's a chance for countries to unite and bundle their resources to study."</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this on a global scale." "Pew Charitable Trust has a similar project in which a global system allows the prosecution of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">"there are signs that FISH-i's activities not only detect criminals, but also scare them off."</seg>
<seg id="143">"ships that had previously been confiscated without a license and hardly had to reckon with consequences, now know that they are being watched."</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH trade now have a 33% increase in fishing turnover since fishing boats buy more licences."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia had helped to track Greko 1, the inspectors found smuggler nets where they were banned."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries also notice these successes." "the effect is so strong that now other countries are copying us," "says Kiilu." "we are an object of study." "in West Africa several hundred million dollars disappear every year through illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"in 2015, six countries joined together, the so-called West Africa Task Force. they also fight against illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH-i." "Security is the goal of even more such initiatives and structures to be created in other regions," "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently FISH-i's latest member state Somalia has recently announced his first major triumph: in October, Greko 1, a ship that was traveling under false flag."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also invaded into forbidden waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "taking measures against Greko 1 set a strong sign that they are against illegal fishing," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time proof that such a special, collaborative approach to protecting the oceans really works across the world sea. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London."</seg>

<seg id="230">My father took me four times to La Perla - everything in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">The first and last time he was waiting for me at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">"when he took me for the second time, he ordered me to get off. he led me to a barrack, in the cars, furniture, TV, fridges - just everything possible."</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">"he gave me a small packet wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to wear it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a great lump of silver."</seg>
<seg id="235">"on that day I went to the other end of the barracks, where the stolen items were removed and kept me with a guard."</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">The prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I peened in and saw a couch where people were tortured.</seg>
<seg id="239">It looked like a bunkbed and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they attached it to the end of a cable. the other end was fastened to the body of the person who was just engrossed there.</seg>
<seg id="241">"they unleashed a man with handcuffs to the bed, poured it with water and chased him a load of 220 volts into the genitals."</seg>

<seg id="243">The stench there was horrific... like a dirty wind.</seg>
<seg id="244">"years later, when my father was under house arrest, the same smell came out of his room."</seg>
<seg id="245">I immediately recognized the smell and I realized that this is the smell of a body in need.</seg>
<seg id="246">I never forgot this odour.</seg>
<seg id="247">And I asked myself: how is it possible that a person can do so much suffering to another?</seg>
<seg id="248">I knew these people were killed</seg>
<seg id="249">"when my father took me to work for the third time, he led me to the entrance of La Cuadra - the area where the prisoners were tied with handcuffs and bore eyelids."</seg>
<seg id="250">"he spoke to" Chubi "Lopez (Jose López, a civilian who was also indicted in the trial) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cuadra."</seg>
<seg id="251">"in the background, I saw a number of mattresses on which naked people lay down with the face downwards - all were captivated by hands and feet."</seg>
<seg id="252">"in the vicinity of the entrance, people were lying calmly on the mattresses."</seg>
<seg id="253">"when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners, he said," "What do you look like, asshole?"</seg>
<seg id="254">"I replied," Why did you bring me anywhere else? ""</seg>
<seg id="255">I knew that these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">They were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="257">I know this because my father told me about it at home.</seg>
<seg id="258">"in addition to La Cuadra, some rooms were designated as offices."</seg>
<seg id="259">I know that "Palito" Romero clashed and killed a man there.</seg>
<seg id="260">"according to the survivor of the survivor, Jorge Romero, who was also accused of the La Perla Ribera trial, was sentenced to death by the students Raúl Mateo Molina."</seg>

<seg id="263">"when you look at the map, you see that they took about this path and were then tortured for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="264">Here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of dehumanisation.</seg>
<seg id="265">"when they survived the torture, the prisoners were thrown into the cuadra until the order from above came to be laid."</seg>
<seg id="266">This was the lie - the euphemism - for the shooting of people and the disappearance of their corpses in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="267">The 'spoils' of war</seg>
<seg id="268">My father brought home all kinds of stolen things.</seg>
<seg id="269">At that time I had no idea what the "spoils" - as they called - was.</seg>

<seg id="276">I just don't understand it.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was also an officer in the gendarmerie and I would never like to enter a house and steal everything in it.</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my father could do that.</seg>
<seg id="279">Once he called me a criminal and I replied: "and you who steal cars on the road?</seg>
<seg id="280">You are not a criminal?</seg>
<seg id="281">"he exploded in rage, struck me and shouted,"</seg>
<seg id="282">"when you go so far, I will find you and kill yourself."</seg>
<seg id="283">We don't need anyone else to do that!</seg>
<seg id="284">That is how my father was.</seg>
<seg id="285">I don't have a single good memory of him.</seg>
<seg id="286">"as I said in the process, I showed a photo of back then, on which I wore a jacket and a turtleneck jumper made of wool. both had my father from La Perla."</seg>
<seg id="287">"we were not poor, but nevertheless he brought clothing home."</seg>
<seg id="288">"at that time, the defense accused me of being a conspirator of this crime. I replied, no problem, they can lay me a burden on what they wanted."</seg>
<seg id="289">I was there anyway to testify.</seg>

<seg id="292">"I have children. once you have children, one recognizes the value of a life."</seg>
<seg id="293">One develops further and realises that it is wrong to kill.</seg>
<seg id="294">I even went so far to say:</seg>
<seg id="295">"well, you have executed people during the dictatorship. but why leave the corpses disappear?"</seg>
<seg id="296">Why children kidnap?</seg>
<seg id="297">"one day, my father brought a girl home, whose mother had been killed."</seg>
<seg id="298">"she was like our pet, almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl."</seg>
<seg id="299">"I always asked myself: they were tortured, but why were they killed?"</seg>
<seg id="300">You could have just put them in jail.</seg>
<seg id="301">I guess it was simply decided to kill these people. but why would their bodies disappear?</seg>
<seg id="302">Did these people not also have families with whom one could hand over their mortal remains?</seg>
<seg id="303">The disappearance of the corpse is the last abominable act that one can do to a man.</seg>
<seg id="304">"my father told me when democracy was reintroduced, they picked up machines to remove the mortal remnants of the prisoners."</seg>

<seg id="308">Only to clarify it: I have nothing against the military.</seg>
<seg id="309">I was even myself at the gendarmerie.</seg>
<seg id="310">"I just said the truth about 20 criminals, including my father."</seg>
<seg id="311">The thought of seeing my father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="312">I made him allegations of all the cruelty that I had to witness with him.</seg>
<seg id="313">"then he suddenly said," "I don't know. I didn't kill anybody."</seg>
<seg id="314">"I felt inwardly rejected and asked myself what all the exaggerated patriotism and" "Western and Christian feelings", "which they supposedly defended, were actually good."</seg>

<seg id="346">Edit the original photos by Joshua Levine.</seg>
<seg id="347">"in the Japanese city of Kyoto, customers of a newly opened center in which one can prolong its driving license, last month witnessed a particularly dismissive translation."</seg>
<seg id="348">"in a sign, the Japanese word" "(koregbelow sha), which means" "older motorists" "wrongly - but perhaps also with evil hind thought & # 8212; as" "fearful motorists" "translated."</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was to be read from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself.</seg>
<seg id="350">"editing of the original photos by Joshua Levine, which has been widely shared in the social media."</seg>
<seg id="351">"the error was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers."</seg>
<seg id="352">"the Kyoto Shimbun, which is published in Kyoto, wrote:"</seg>
<seg id="353">"" "how could it come to such an English translation?"</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>
<seg id="355">"this is an insult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable," "said Holmes."</seg>
<seg id="356">"the incorrect English translation was first removed. the designation" terrible drivers "was later replaced by the appropriate, although grammatically not quite correct name" elder drivers "(German:" older drivers ")."</seg>
<seg id="357">"the police of the Kyoto Prefecture apologized for the translation error. furthermore, she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for correctness before it was published."</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows on the apology:</seg>
<seg id="359">"we are sincerely sorry that elderly people felt insulted by the inadequate correction (translation) on our part," "said the police."</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News has dealt a bit more extensively with the phenomenon of the "terrible" elderly drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">"the word" "fearful" "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the share of older drivers who have been involved in accidents across the country is quite an occasion for concern."</seg>
<seg id="362">"in Kyoto prefecture, for example, 1,941 of 19,460 deaths were caused by seniors in 2005. this corresponds to a share of 10%."</seg>
<seg id="363">"ten years later, in 2014, seniors created 1,803 of a total of 11,850 accidents."</seg>
<seg id="364">This increased their share to 17.7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">"while the number of accidents has decreased overall, the proportion of accidents caused by seniors has risen during the same period."</seg>
<seg id="366">The so-called reporter brought comments to the light published in the article published on Yahoo which show which prejudices some Japanese seem to have against older drivers:</seg>
<seg id="367">"among other things, the article on the translation error received the following comments:"</seg>
<seg id="368">"" "is this (" "horrible motorists" ") not the reality?"</seg>
<seg id="369">"-" So erroneous is the translation really not, isn't it? ""</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">"to translate, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the source text and active language skills to translate it into the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">"the latter demands the active domination of the target language - something that is the case in native speakers. generally, the conviction that translators in the target language should not be in the initial language - native speakers."</seg>
<seg id="379">"for example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English."</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr-user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as their mother tongue, who could make translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translating, cost-reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies that don't have foreign employees can still make translations in-house. then, the Japanese employee, whose English knowledge is best assessed, is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are."</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr-user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"the confused and enigmatic sentences, which arise through machine translation, show that this technique cannot replace a human translator for a long time. this applies to some languages very special."</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strangest English phrases in Japan, including puzzling prints that often decorate t-shirts or bags, are used only for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood."</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr-user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">"translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry. however, from large companies or government who have the means to ensure higher standards, it is possible to expect more careful translations."</seg>
<seg id="389">"in the future, the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for its translations."</seg>

<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there.</seg>

<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">"when she was ten years old, she started working as Crimean for the family. in Paraguay the more than 46,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school."</seg>
<seg id="423">"the business is quite simple: a big family with little money gives her underage son or her minor daughter to another, more plentiful family. in exchange, the child gets food, training and a roof over the head."</seg>
<seg id="424">"however, what is not mentioned is that the children have to pay countless days of housework that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can be - and all that within the framework of a contract that one cannot lift up."</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice referred to as Criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organizations.</seg>
<seg id="426">"after graduating, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls."</seg>
<seg id="427">"she talked to Crimean tas, especially young girls affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced."</seg>
<seg id="428">"she tried to call things by name, because the feeling of gratitude that is inoculated by the Crimean is generally silent."</seg>
<seg id="429">"Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga. "</seg>
<seg id="430">"on the one hand, the family, who has their daughter in believing that they will complete their education, improve their position in society and" make something out of themselves "can be handed over to another family."</seg>

<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">It was Crimean in the household of the former military staff of Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo who worked as an official at the Einwohnermeldeamt.</seg>
<seg id="439">"Marín lived with them in their house in Vaquería, a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital Asunción."</seg>
<seg id="440">"at the end of January 2016, Ferreira hit Marín as long as she suffered fatal injuries."</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">"a few days later, the media reported the incident."</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a Crimean.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations such as UNICEF or Callescuela held the practice of Criadazgo's death deep within the Paraguayan society for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They referred the Crimean azgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>

<seg id="458">But they all went further to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent to the capital Asunción as Crimean.</seg>
<seg id="460">"in the house of her employer, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours each day."</seg>
<seg id="461">"in doing so, she had to divide the time in such a way that she was still time to learn."</seg>
<seg id="462">She rose every morning at five o'clock and prepared breakfast for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">"for example, she cleansed the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor."</seg>
<seg id="464">"when the school was over, she went home again and had time to learn."</seg>
<seg id="465">"the sooner it was finished with learning, the more free time she had."</seg>
<seg id="466">But even this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="467">"Alvarenga says she never had to starve, but also did not get unlimited food." I was allowed to get more books from the library of the landlord than eating out of the fridge, "she remembers."</seg>
<seg id="468">"the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathiser of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party which was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989."</seg>
<seg id="469">"on some evenings, the host Alvarenga forced to stand alongside him and read leading articles such as" Sendero "or" El Pueblo. ""</seg>

<seg id="501">Published under public domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">"sixty Egyptian parliamentarians have recently agreed to draft legislation on" "regulating the use and benefits of social networks". ""</seg>
<seg id="503">"when it is accepted by the Parliament, users of social media in Egypt must be registered with a government authority in order to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="504">"" "on the basis of the law, a place would then be set up to give citizens permission to use social media."</seg>
<seg id="505">"within six months with the adoption of the law, users must register on the site of the site with their proper names and identity card numbers to be able to use social networks."</seg>
<seg id="506">"if this fails to do so, it could bring a penalty of up to six months in prison or a financial penalty."</seg>
<seg id="507">"the bill consisting of six paragraphs and curses in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as" any application that runs through the Internet and is used to communicate with others through voice, video surveillance and text. "</seg>
<seg id="508">"it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted, as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities can impose its registration on users who do not register considering the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation on the level of social media companies."</seg>
<seg id="509">"Riyad Abdul Sattar, Parliament-approved and supporter of the bill, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users who received a username and password from the telecommunications ministry to get through the firewall blocking Facebook."</seg>
<seg id="510">"this could mean that Egypt is planning to build a firewall on a national level around Facebook. because of those, it would be necessary for Egyptians to file information about their identity in order to access the network."</seg>

<seg id="515">"in my opinion, they imagine that just like they could violently control physical public and private spaces, it could also be done online."</seg>
<seg id="516">"if I take them seriously, it means they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who seek permission or not. and that means a crazy system to monitor people's activities and also to bring them to a court process."</seg>
<seg id="517">"this is technically not realistic, but everything is possible in Egypt."</seg>
<seg id="518">"in order to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed at the Legislative Assembly and the Constitutional Committees before it enters the plenary debate."</seg>

<seg id="524">"this article by Todd Reubold was published in the original at Ensia.com, a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions."</seg>
<seg id="525">"high up in the mountains of Kurdistan in the north east of Iraq, the animal conservationist Hana Ahmed Raza and her team of scientists of the NGO Nature Iraq are working to protect the ghostly Persican leopards."</seg>
<seg id="526">"a subspecies of the larger family of leopards, which roams through Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian Leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor). altogether, there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature."</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">"as Raza appeared in the video," the Persian leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem "and the health and the flourishing of the ecosystem also depends on a large predator."</seg>
<seg id="529">"the chance to see a Persian leopard actually in the wild bobsleigh is low and goes against zero. as the team in the video therefore states that they have a picture of a big cat in the camera, Raza breaks out in pure joy."</seg>
<seg id="530">"as a trained biologist, Raza passionately likes to show another side of her country, which consists not only of war and conflict."</seg>
<seg id="531">It has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years.</seg>

<seg id="544">"in early March 2017, the daily Kahoku Shimpo, the daily newspaper Kahoku Shimpo, has documented the progress made in the last six years in order to rebuild the lives of those affected by the" triple catastrophe "of March 2011."</seg>
<seg id="545">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in the prefecture of Miyagi. the prefecture of Miyagi was a state prefecture in Japan's northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the tsunami."</seg>
<seg id="546">"hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring detectives Fukushima and Iwate were forced to evacuate, as the tsunami had left whole coastal cities disappear from the map."</seg>
<seg id="547">"the Fukushima Prefecture has yet experienced a nuclear accident, which is why 160,000 inhabitants had to leave their homes."</seg>
<seg id="548">"the special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows, from a local point of view, what progress has been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the lives of local residents."</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper covers both the statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority and the survey results of the affected persons themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">"the apartment building in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate"</seg>
<seg id="551">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of planned replacement buildings (that," Saigai kouei juutaku) were completed in the Fukushima prefectures, Miyagi and Iwate. "</seg>
<seg id="552">"Miyagi was able to register the biggest success among the three prefectures, and 80 percent of the planned replacement buildings were completed."</seg>
<seg id="553">"Iwate has completed 75 percent of such buildings, whereas Fukushima represents 70 percent of the final light."</seg>
<seg id="554">"however, even six years after the disaster, it is still hard to relocate evacuated shelters from Behel shelters (the" "kasetsu juutaku" ") into final spares."</seg>
<seg id="555">"after the triple catastrophe, nearly 80,000 people saw themselves forced to live in shelters."</seg>
<seg id="556">"in December 2016, more and more 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such homes."</seg>
<seg id="557">"almost 40 percent of the evacuated Fukushima evacuated in 2011 still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful here. more than 75 percent of the evacuated evacuated homes were resettled to final homes."</seg>
<seg id="558">"for Iwate, the number is here at 34 percent."</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three concerned prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">"like the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper, 1074 of 1100 schools affected by misfortune have opened their doors until December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the three prefectures schools."</seg>
<seg id="561">"six years later, industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult."</seg>
<seg id="562">"while nearly 100 per cent of the fishing harbours in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 percent of the fishing harbours have resumed their operations in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="563">Tsunami and nuclear accident have affected agricultural land in the three prefectures of agrarian land.</seg>
<seg id="564">"Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 percent of agricultural land in Iwate and less than 50 per cent destroyed agricultural land in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="565">"it is unlikely that this is just a consequence of nuclear accident, as only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed agricultural land of Fukushima, are located in the" nuclear proliferation zone. ""</seg>
<seg id="566">"in two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered largely, but Fukushima remains unbeaten here as well."</seg>
<seg id="567">"the tourist figures in Miyagi and Iwate are again 90 percent on the same stand, as before the misfortune. Fukushima, on the other hand, can show only 75 percent."</seg>
<seg id="568">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe nearly half of the inhabitants of the coast, it is more difficult to earn their livelihood."</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">"in order to obtain a complete picture, the paper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuated countries."</seg>
<seg id="571">"in her introduction to the article, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:"</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey in order to learn more about the tsunami awareness among the indigenous population.</seg>
<seg id="573">Survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to prepare for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">"however, 55.9 percent of those surveyed still do not have enough in catastrophes prevention."</seg>
<seg id="575">How it is about those who had to be evacuated from the Fukushima Prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">"in its edition commemorating the anniversary of the earthquake, Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung emphasised its attention to the situation of the Evacuees from Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="577">"Fukushima had not only had to witness the massive earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, the Fukushima Prefecture was also witness to the worst, catastrophic, nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed."</seg>
<seg id="578">"from 160 000 Evacuees from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were transferred to areas outside the prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="579">"at the beginning of 2016 some more than 23,000 people, back to Fukushima, had been resettled into permanent replacement houses."</seg>
<seg id="580">"as of 2017, there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside of their prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="581">"most of the evacuated areas still in Behel shelters are older than 50 years old. it is known that the efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima will have to compete with massive construction projects."</seg>

<seg id="627">"Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, which is located in the western Cuban province of Mayabethen, is generally known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - notwithstanding the fact that there is no significant sugar harvest on site."</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities were paralysed in the sugar cane factories.</seg>
<seg id="629">"after the war, the sugar cane industry remained silent in the region, and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the scaffolding of steel and concrete remained."</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to invent themselves.</seg>

<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">"the crushing of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated, and hardly competitive they became unbearable for the country."</seg>
<seg id="644">"the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes."</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories that could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>

<seg id="692">"the youth of the First Nations communities throughout Canada deal with topics that are important to them. they do so by means of hip-hop, thanks to a series of hiking workshops."</seg>
<seg id="693">"as part of the N'we Jinan Tour, workshops and youth centres have been bringing workshops and youth centres directly to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach young groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances."</seg>
<seg id="694">"the original workshops were led by the teacher David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in North Quebec with ten Cree communities and then worked with the Cree Hip-Hop group The Northstars."</seg>
<seg id="695">"the workshop is thus increasing that the young participants meet topics such as" cultural identity, language, engagement, love, self-acceptance, "or whatever comes to mind."</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the youth are the protagonists.</seg>
<seg id="697">"because the workshops were so popular, the team also collaborated with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Winnebago in Nebraska State."</seg>
<seg id="698">"this video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the tribal region of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called" Highway of tears, "a section of road in Westkanada, where nearly two dozens of mostly indigenous young women were disappeared or murdered."</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were mostly not elucidated.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motive of a video player to convey the importance of preserving traditional customs and customs despite the influence of globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">"many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people don't always have the languages of the First Nations."</seg>
<seg id="702">"in the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation recorded, the chorus is sung on Cree."</seg>
<seg id="703">"the young people took some help from the Northstar hip-hop group, who gave them a Strophe in the dialect of Eastern James Bay Cree."</seg>
<seg id="704">"on the Facebook page of N'we Jinan, the Strophe is available in transcription, as is a translation into English translated into German:"</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to continue my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">That is the day when you will take our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we as youth have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">This is how they can grow and move forward as well as our youth.</seg>
<seg id="712">This is how they can do what they intended for the Creator.</seg>
<seg id="713">"in the commentary box, the reader and proponent of the Cree language Kevin Brousseau also makes a contribution and adds the Strophe in syllable script (which is also published on his blog and published here with permission):"</seg>

<seg id="718">"in Japan, you can see plastic courts in front of almost every restaurant."</seg>
<seg id="719">"to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu, are displayed near the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (" "plastic models of dishes" ") from any food served in this restaurant."</seg>
<seg id="720">The customers see themselves in these plastic courts and then decide whether to enter or continue the restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry devoted to the production of these plastic courts.</seg>
<seg id="722">"there are a large number of small businesses in the tokier district of Kappabashi, which produce those plastic courts that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="723">"for most Japanese, these plastic courts are usually that they don't even notice them anymore. however, a new trend is now transformed into showy mobile accessories and other gadgets."</seg>
<seg id="724">"at Naver Matome, the blogger itinii published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru."</seg>
<seg id="725">"now in special sale: new with plastic rubbers decorated cell phones, as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store."</seg>
<seg id="726">"many of these artificial food were turned into kitschy collection objects, as in this case, refrigerator magnets:"</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few shoeboarding refrigerator magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of essences is becoming increasingly more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case a kaisen-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) turned into a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular dish (lol) we found a good use as a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part for the exhibition in Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that contains your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">"designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design."</seg>
<seg id="734">And this is only the beginning of an increasing approach to the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">"some mobile phone stand and mobile designers allow you to produce your own work of art. in this case, ikura or salmon are used, a popular topping that is served with white rice."</seg>
<seg id="736">"on Twitter, some users had their doubts:"</seg>
<seg id="737">"someone who would say:" wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile with laughing cheating?. ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">"this interest in plastic ribbons can also take a less appetizing form, for example to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasantly."</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile stand has the shape of melted ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">"in addition, there are also padstables (onigiri), earrings and handybands made of dried salmon."</seg>
<seg id="742">"other quirky plastic courts can be found at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter, hashtag #, to see the '#'."</seg>
<seg id="743">"if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend, then this video gives you an insight into the district of Kappabashi, which is devoted to the supply of the restaurant industry."</seg>

<seg id="749">"in reports from domestic and foreign media about the notorious" fight against drug trafficking "in Mexico, the suspects and killed regularly appear only in statistics, but these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle entails."</seg>
<seg id="750">"reporting on drugs bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, the chief of the Sinaloa-Kartell, crowded the stories of the victims of the conflict completely in the background."</seg>
<seg id="751">"on the day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the bereaved or the churches that have learned to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="752">"behind every body, behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never heal."</seg>
<seg id="753">"this is why the Mexican news portal Animal Político has launched the digital project" Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco "(German:" with the drug trade "), which is to give these victims a voice and narrate stories of people who were involved in the struggle between the law enforcement authorities and cartels."</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime not only causes us to fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">"for example, when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities therefore have to go many kilometers to buy something like milk."</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of the victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video titled "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" (German: "how afraid life changes") tells exactly these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">"a main character is Guadalupe, a father who searches hidden graves after his son every weekend."</seg>
<seg id="761">"or Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who lost her father, her four siblings, her husband and two of her nephews on only one day."</seg>
<seg id="762">"priests:" as every Sunday, we prepare ourselves today for the task that we have set ourselves to go and search for graves, according to the people we have loved. "</seg>
<seg id="763">Guadalupe Contreras: "my son is Antonio Contreras Mata.</seg>
<seg id="764">He was 28 when he disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="765">He has three children.</seg>
<seg id="766">He worked in an electrical business in El Naranjo.</seg>
<seg id="767">On 13 October he left the house.</seg>
<seg id="768">"on October 15th, he was supposed to be back, but he never came back." Emma Veleta said: "it is very difficult for me, because I am now alone with three children who need training."</seg>
<seg id="769">"there is also my mother, who is also here with me."</seg>
<seg id="770">At the moment it has no income.</seg>
<seg id="771">"you are the insurance of my father, but she doesn't pay them out because they demand a death certificate."</seg>
<seg id="772">Where should we get them? "</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a vivir con el Narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">"" "we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, fragility and governance."</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">"KYHB, a reader of Animal Político, wrote this article from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="778">"their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal, no matter what form it occurs:"</seg>
<seg id="779">I have been familiar with disease and sensationalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">"every day I pass newspaper kiosks and see the front pages with pictures, which can only come from a textbook for criminology or from collaborators."</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the frame.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to that body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">It writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks that he wants to become Narco (German: drug dealers) when he is big. and it's not normal that people hear songs about the" heroic deeds "of the offenders when they go through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is as if they ridicule those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something has happened to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"the inaction of the people is incredible for me, if the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring town is justified by the fact that they were" "watered". ""</seg>
<seg id="789">"I think they try to persuade themselves that they are spared from such tragedies, if they do not touch and remain silent."</seg>
<seg id="790">"Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article" Four months blackmail in the main town district: how a family was sacked by threats. "in this, she describes how armed criminals pressed money from their business until they end up destroying not only the business, but also tore their family apart."</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">"the pain above never passes, the trauma stays, fear comes up again when you are alone."</seg>
<seg id="793">"habits have changed, phone numbers too."</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">"the farther we are from each other, the better."</seg>
<seg id="796">She closed her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">"we want the others to be arrested, for you don't know when they will kidnap you or kill you."</seg>
<seg id="798">"in these terrible days I asked myself whether crying would dissolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="799">Journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the article "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad Juárez: a Generation of Violence."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions like: who cares for the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow up in a settlement at the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">"he is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care about them."</seg>
<seg id="803">"Bryan is a orphan and he says that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, make potatoes, make tortillas warm and" Chichi "for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water, sugar and milk powder."</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for each year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared."</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">"his childhood was past two years before, when he was just a few blocks from his home, seeing the bloody corpse of his father, who had been shot by armed men from a passing car."</seg>
<seg id="809">"when Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:"</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 when violence was mixed by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">"in 2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Civil Councillor for Public Safety and Government of the Government of the United States."</seg>
<seg id="812">"in 2010 alone, the public prosecutor had 3103 murders. this corresponds to an average of 8.5 mores per day."</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few hundred thousand stories that leave organised crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">"only a few stories continue to live in the face of new headlines. however, this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget."</seg>
<seg id="815">"in addition to the project" Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco, "Animal Político created the narrative journalism project Narcodata, whose aim is to portray the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking, which has tormented the country in the last four decades."</seg>

<seg id="819">"but how is the year after something has appeared for the first time? content in social media, whether true or untrue, tends to continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">"since its first release, it has been misleading to photograph tragedies that have actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="822">"this false coupling of image and event -" false description "or" false context "in terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful coverage of events in the DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria."</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for images to news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">"in 2010 a tanker crossed the town of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tilted around and exploded. 230 people lost their lives."</seg>
<seg id="826">"after the civil war, Africa's second largest country had been neglected for years and devastated. the streets in the region became dangerous paths full of potholes that were difficult to navigate."</seg>
<seg id="827">"tragically, the tank truck fell victim to that."</seg>
<seg id="828">"officials described a fireball, which envelops dozens of houses including a cinemas close by, which was full of people who watched the World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses wasted and charted corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="831">"a picture with the title" "This is Nigeria" "by Imgur-users Mystical Monkey, 12 January 2015.Several photos of the incident form the gruesome scenes of this day."</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of charred bodies strung on the ground while people look at them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not end.</seg>
<seg id="835">"over the years the same photo was taken several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and wrongly attributed to real tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">"on 3 January 2015, fighters of Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon."</seg>
<seg id="838">Witnesses reported drastically the atrocities they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">"there were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred."</seg>
<seg id="841">"but the figures could not be confirmed." "no one left to count corpses," "said a resident of Human Rights Watch."</seg>
<seg id="842">"many were dismembered, shot or burned."</seg>
<seg id="843">"only on the basis of satellite images, the follow-up time could be depicted graphically."</seg>
<seg id="844">"the reason for the attack was also unsolved, but the Baga military base was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerian and the attempt of Boko Haram to win land (examples from 2013 and 2015)."</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from the DR Congo emerged again when it was falsely presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">That is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">"a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris."</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">"in fact, this fraudulent use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a number of misappings; Africa Check has documented access to Nigeria since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="851">"in all these cases, the picture was presented as a proof of mass killings."</seg>
<seg id="852">"one step further, personal comments such as this example mistakenly assume the picture from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to deliver arguments."</seg>
<seg id="853">The image of Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">"according to a blitzkrieg, published by the United Nations, those who were able to flee were beaten, rape and several dead, some through burning."</seg>
<seg id="855">"while others reported on the violence against Rohingya, Posts appeared like the following who brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:"</seg>

<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames (framing) that go through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photograph was used in relation to greater discussions about silence in connection with the murders of Christians by Muslims or - for defending the Muslims - the killings of Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is underrated as compared to a European or French life.</seg>

<seg id="932">"however, a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these pictures."</seg>
<seg id="933">"with social media, there are dozens of people who have inadvertently share the water around a tragedy."</seg>
<seg id="934">"suggests this mood of wrong and false information that actual atrocities are untrue and adorn the actual horror of what is actually happening in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?"</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of forcible images has already been debated in detail (here for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">"one argument is that withholding images of a refusal to recognize the tragedy. at times, these pictures are even asked by the victims themselves."</seg>
<seg id="937">"at the same time, the concern is that violent images desensitise readers and viewers and take the ability to feel empathy (for example, this study that investigated how violent media act to help others)."</seg>
<seg id="938">"while there is a lot to discuss about violent portrayals in the news media, it is a fact that they are indispensable for today's news reporting."</seg>
<seg id="939">"technologists are experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against fake news. you will have to think carefully about the situation in which a picture suggests something, which can actually be used by context or completely improper style."</seg>

<seg id="1155">"with the aim of reviewing the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amounts to 72 million US dollars, various religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration on April 3, 2017; the march launched at the Republican Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went down to Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juans."</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the group "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuce" (Citizens Front for the Neural Examination of Debt) and the Comedian Church Assembly in Puerto Ricos.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of redetermination of debt have also filed a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">"the people of Puerto Ricos are calling for politicians, bankers and government agencies responsible for their debts for their corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1160">"we call for a financial audit and a Steering Committee without any personal interests in public debt, with a fixed, our working conditions corresponding remuneration, which acts in favor of the economy."</seg>
<seg id="1161">We are blackmailed and suppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people of Puerto Ricos refuse to pay a debt that is not theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>
<seg id="1164">Our pensioners will not settle down with falling pension payments.</seg>
<seg id="1165">We demand immediate action.</seg>
<seg id="1166">The island - not the sovereign territory of the United States - suffers from a severe financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="1167">"therefore, the so-called" Center for New Economy, "a non-governmental non-profit organisation with a focus on socioeconomic development, proposes a law on state responsibility, as an alternative to the existing state supervision."</seg>
<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1169">The economic and financial crisis Puerto Ricos requires extensive restructuring of the state infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="1170">Measures imposed externally will run without the participation and conviction of citizens in danger of being rejected by the people.</seg>
<seg id="1171">The demonstration was called "NightGuard for Light and Truth."</seg>

<seg id="1185">"this year's re: Publica, the annual conference on digital culture, which is hosted in Berlin, dedicated itself to the # FreeBassel campaign."</seg>
<seg id="1186">"Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the French resident CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, managing director at Book Sprints, produced excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The Cost of Freedom: a Collective Reflection)."</seg>
<seg id="1187">"the book, which was published last year and is available here royalty-free, contains a number of essays that deal with free culture in the face of oppression."</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a tribute to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it says:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book wants to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built up and what are the real costs associated with.</seg>
<seg id="1191">"activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to create some sense from our different experiences."</seg>
<seg id="1192">"this book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been detained in Syria since 15 March 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1193">"his name was removed from the directory of the Adra prison, in which he sat on 3 October 2015."</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then we have no information on his current status or whereabouts.</seg>
<seg id="1195">"the introductory part of his book entitled Collective Remembrance gives his friends and his family a voice, who want to push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom, instantly."</seg>
<seg id="1196">"seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in free culture, many of us have started thinking about their own fates, deeds and decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of temporarily extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital assets has been in custody since March 2012 in the custody of Syrian government agencies.</seg>
<seg id="1201">"in October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military institution, to an unknown location."</seg>
<seg id="1202">"his wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the" military police Bassel had taken on the basis of a "strictly secret" command of the military tribunal from his prison in Adra. "</seg>
<seg id="1203">"Ghazi reported that she was contacted by persons on November 12, 2015, who presented themselves as an inside of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband."</seg>
<seg id="1204">"however, his place of residence and condition remain unknown."</seg>
<seg id="1205">"a pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria."</seg>
<seg id="1206">"Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and currently crossing the ladder of New Palmyra, a project created by Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:"</seg>
<seg id="1207">"perhaps none of Bassels found cultural prototypes foresighted as the work he started with a group of archeologists and 3D artists around 2005, in order to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra."</seg>
<seg id="1208">"Palmyra, one of the world's most important archaeological sites, was the crossroads of numerous civilizations and here the Greek-Roman architectural types merge with local traditions and Persian influence."</seg>
<seg id="1209">"at that time Bassel could not yet know that ten years after he began this work, the IS would do everything to wipe out this architecture, which embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world."</seg>
<seg id="1210">This expedient to digital archeology and preservation has created a time capsule which will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">"tragically, Bassel could not finish this project yet."</seg>
<seg id="1212">"Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband, sharing his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:"</seg>
<seg id="1213">"I spent my entire life in dreaming of freedom, and Bassel taught me to embrace her."</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">"Bassel taught me English, even when he was already in jail."</seg>
<seg id="1216">"I learned to read, write and speak English well."</seg>
<seg id="1217">"he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked. he has taught other prisoners to read, write, and speak English."</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened my door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">"he also taught other prisoners as they use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands."</seg>
<seg id="1221">"Ghazi is also the author of waiting (waiting), a provocation that she wrote to her husband in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in custody."</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together in the book for a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">"she smuggled the lyrics to him, when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic into English."</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is available royalty free.</seg>

<seg id="1226">The book is dedicated to the public domain.</seg>
<seg id="1227">Here is an excerpt from the book of Nora with the title "It is happening":</seg>

<seg id="1229">"that I sink in the world of your beautiful eyes,"</seg>
<seg id="1230">"that I lose the mind in the moment we embrace,"</seg>
<seg id="1231">That I don't care about any of the dangers:</seg>
<seg id="1232">"each of the fences, shackles and guards"</seg>
<seg id="1233">I forget the confines of the prison</seg>
<seg id="1234">"and I enter into every detail of your voice and words,"</seg>
<seg id="1235">"which I bear with passion,"</seg>
<seg id="1236">When your eyes say goodbye</seg>
<seg id="1237">And I leave another piece of my soul with you...</seg>
<seg id="1238">"I quickly return to my loneliness,"</seg>
<seg id="1239">"to bring back all the moments,"</seg>
<seg id="1240">And to weep and smile about your absence.</seg>
<seg id="1241">I witness myself that I will return soon...</seg>
<seg id="1242">"on the first anniversary of the detention of Bassel, Ghazi wrote:"</seg>
<seg id="1243">"a year goes by, my soul"</seg>

<seg id="1247">Bastille's history is not unique in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1248">"since the protests in 2011 against the regime Bashar al-Assad, more than 65,000 people have disappeared, according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian Network for Human Rights)."</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or disappeared under the regime were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">"by 2016, according to the international human rights organisation Amnesty International, at least 17,723 Syrians have died in jail since 2011."</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>

<seg id="1253">We repeat today our demand in the hope that we have to do for the last time.</seg>
<seg id="1254">"Mozambique: due to corruption convicted, post-release director on previous post"</seg>
<seg id="1255">"with anger, Mosambique reacted to a corruption case in which a member of the government returned after half of his sentence to the workplace in the state apparatus, where the corruption was committed."</seg>
<seg id="1256">"it is Diodino Cambaza, which was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison in 2010 along with four other defendants for the misappropriation of 54 million Meet al (approximately 800,000 Euros)."</seg>
<seg id="1257">"the money came from public funds from the Mozambique airports, whose advice was Cambaza between 2005 and 2008."</seg>
<seg id="1258">"Cambaza was released in 2016 because of good management and immediately called for his re-adjustment to the company, which happened on April 19."</seg>
<seg id="1259">"in accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, which rejected the motion, there would be no obstacle to Cambaza to return to his old post, as the company did not carry out disciplinary proceedings after his detention."</seg>
<seg id="1260">"however, many people do not call the action well."</seg>
<seg id="1261">"in an interview with Deutsche Welle, the Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, CIP), condemned the decision of the company to re-establish the director:"</seg>
<seg id="1262">Represents a setback in the fight against corruption and underlines the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards with regard to the efforts of our legal system such as CIP.</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that even the company should have initiated disciplinary proceedings against the contrary.</seg>
<seg id="1264">"the company, however, seems to have no reasonable legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions."</seg>
<seg id="1265">"Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Muslim social media, also rejects this behavior and considers the case as" "contrary" ":"</seg>
<seg id="1266">"if Cambaza was a competent type, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of which had been lowered."</seg>
<seg id="1267">"he could hold paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish his image."</seg>
<seg id="1268">"but since he is incompetent, he consented to be reintegrated into the company, which he helped to inflict damage."</seg>
<seg id="1269">"consequently, it is obvious: Cambaza will gladly pay for his silence."</seg>
<seg id="1270">Contradictory!</seg>
<seg id="1271">"Bitone Viage, a young Muslim and student of political science in Brazil says, the director has no moral:"</seg>
<seg id="1272">"Cambaza is rewarded by the state because he offended him, I can't believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that the state has already been so massively offended."</seg>
<seg id="1273">"Cambaza is missing the morals and serving the state, * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead only served themselves on the state."</seg>
<seg id="1274">"Cambaza used the state as it was an inexhaustible source of money, and the state itself has become tired of this man who was precharged and finally sentenced to long imprisonment."</seg>
<seg id="1275">"to be honest, I don't know why this man was rewarded in such a way."</seg>
<seg id="1276">"Francey Zeúte prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, to remember that a thief is in jail:"</seg>
<seg id="1277">"thieves are part of the Samora Machel prison, which will not only remain in memory for the Mozambique people but also as the first independent president, but also as a sharp, single-edged and - by the way - prophetic speaker."</seg>
<seg id="1278">"one of his most famous oral presentations was when he vigorously confirmed that" an ambitious man is capable of all, even the fatherland for his ambitions, his own individual interest, to sell. "</seg>
<seg id="1279">"Samora also said," I don't know if an ambitious person changes, my experience shows that it is not so. he changes the tactics, but he does not turn away from his ambitions. "</seg>
<seg id="1280">An ambitious person is criminal at the same time. "</seg>
<seg id="1281">"in Twitter, the reactions were also rejected:"</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook blocks the "Kalar" racist word in Myanmar and censors many users wrongly</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Burmese word "Kalar pae" means chickpeas or splits.</seg>
<seg id="1288">"photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported"</seg>
<seg id="1289">"according to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known Social Network took their posts from the network because they contained the word 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although the origin of the word is still being discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an adjective" "Indian". ""</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook censors the word" "Kalar" "or" "by" "(in Burmese writing) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma within the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">"in recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely disgraceful connotation."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar, the company censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"indeed," Kalar "may normally be associated with racism, but the word itself does not automatically evoke hate speech."</seg>
<seg id="1296">"context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that Posts, in which they discussed the use of the word or expressed doubt for their use, were censored."</seg>
<seg id="1297">"in addition, there are several Burmese words with different meanings, which have the same character sequence as' Kalar '."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, the chair is written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae', 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalqi' (curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooking Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar'so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A mail of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">"however, he asked his friends in a witty way whether they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a pun."</seg>
<seg id="1302">The phrase ku la - "Healing" (ku) + the question face (la) in Burmese resembles the racist expression very much but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"Zin Win Htet is the opinion that she will reduce the hate speech of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical before deleting all posts that are suspected of spreading racism."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism will not understand what you are writing on Faceook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">"what it should do instead, is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the words next to it."</seg>
<seg id="1309">"for example," Kalar Htine "(chair) and" Kalar pae. ""</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good thing is that these dirty nationalists, who spread hate speech, have received a fairly good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action may send a strong signal to all who spread hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat demonstrated that the censorship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks can simply start using a new word or alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to delete his posts when he only wanted to share his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">"when I was aware of this new Facebook guideline, I made a mail to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically, my mail was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited from posting, posting and sharing content for 24 hours because the post" didn't meet the Facebook community standards. ""</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who do not have any negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his mail was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"in the post, the author expressed his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad."</seg>
<seg id="1321">"Chan Myae Khine believes Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community ask for advice:"</seg>
<seg id="1322">"Facebook may have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma through its platform, but it does not work."</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the various communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"in addition, it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as" chair "or" pea curry. ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">"even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the wrongly deleted posts."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a great deal of sales, that would be great."</seg>
<seg id="1327">Ebooks automatic censorship has ensured a lot of ridicule among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">"instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts, which contained no hate speech, but were still removed:"</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text reads "I want to sit on a chair and eat pea curry and watch an Indian movie.</seg>

<seg id="1336">"in the past five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists, who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"among other things, Hassan in social networks should additionally address violence in Myanmar congregations, especially Rakhine, where confrontations between Muslims and Buddhists forced thousands to flee."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"Facebook has been criticised for its failure, the balancing of hate speech on its Burmese sides."</seg>
<seg id="1339">"but rather than censoring the word 'Kalar', it would have been better to focus more on context than initiatives focused on code and learned from them."</seg>

<seg id="1343">The children's marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"on 9 June 2017, Parliament of the country unanimously approved a law banning this practice, so that the age-retardant age is now at 18."</seg>
<seg id="1345">"in May 2016, Brother Harryforsad Maharaj, the leader of the Interreligious Organization (IRO), a group that convened representatives of the various religious groups of the country, said that the state should not interfere because that, age does not determine maturity."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"despite the fact that Trinidad and Tobago are a contractual partner of the UN Convention on Child Rights, the minors are defined as" "every man under 18 years". ""</seg>
<seg id="1347">"statistics of the UN for 2002-2012 show that the share of children who were married to 15 in Trinidad and Tobago amounted to 2.8 percent, and at 18 it was 8.1 percent."</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in 2011, the Federal Statistical Office confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married to 19 in 1997-2007."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"online petitions and social media movements, which were eager to abolish laws for children, followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. undoubtedly, they helped bring this result."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"nevertheless, everything went smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="1351">"a Hindu leader, for example, had no qualms about telling the critics of the children's marriage, they were to take care of their own affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1352">"this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this really uncomplicated matter, and at some point there were doubts as to whether the opposition would agree with the bill in general."</seg>
<seg id="1353">"but at the beginning of 2017 the bill was decided against the children's marriage - despite 4 Senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent, who abstained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law."</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the president of the country has to agree and let the law be announced.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the Senators of the country gave on Facebook a status update which Leslie-Ann Boiselle posted on Instagram again:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against the children's marriage was voted in the House of Representatives with 35 votes for this and no one against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">"having previously been approved by the Senate, the draft can now become a law."</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of social media users were thrilled because the laws for children before finally had been changed.</seg>
<seg id="1359">"member Lovell Francis, who is a minister of ministers in the Ministry of Education, said:"</seg>
<seg id="1360">"it took too much time and unnecessary talk which disguised the heart of the matter, but do you know what? the children's toe is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and that is worth almost every price."</seg>

<seg id="1365">"Folade Mutota, which belongs to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society group that spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was:"</seg>
<seg id="1366">The marriage-capable age in Trinidad and Tobago now amounts to 18 years regardless of the religious affiliation.</seg>
<seg id="1367">"the plan for amending the marriage network was decided today, on 9 June 2017."</seg>

<seg id="1391">"on 18 January 2012, the English-language Wikipedia site was depicted as opposed to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">"for over a month now, Turkey has been blocking the popular and crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day by day it becomes clearer how important the platform for users is to find and share helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">"although many technology-savvy Internet users are used to using conversion tools for blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times report that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence), most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"although Turkey has been blocking article from Wikipedia since 2008, as recently described in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blocking of the Internet has been held since 2007, after the Internet Law (No. 5651) was adopted."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"after China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1399">"while the platform remains locked, there are now several mirrors (pages reflecting the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated)."</seg>
<seg id="1400">"a solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform placed all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (so host computer connections), which is not based on the domain name system and thus makes a complete censorship difficult."</seg>
<seg id="1401">"the content, however, can be retrieved in spite of the legal prohibition."</seg>
<seg id="1402">"in a blog post, IPFS reports about his efforts:"</seg>
<seg id="1403">"after listening to the news (about the blocking of Wikipedia), we put everything in place to cover snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform."</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to at least view all Wikipedia content even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia a.org.</seg>
<seg id="1405">"IPFS also reported that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia-Foundation, and it is just screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website."</seg>
<seg id="1406">"however, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has brought tr.vikiansiklopedia, a mirrorpage from Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that anyone can use to host similar mirrors if Wikipedia is locked in the respective country Wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices Member as well as staff at Mozilla's Open Speaks "podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"it is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror."</seg>
<seg id="1410">One accesses to another URL that is not the original. that what you see then is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">"essentially, the server redirects the inquiry to the correct Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia themselves if they are locked in Turkey."</seg>

<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurry with badly positioned motifs and washed colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">The motivated him to carry a camera with him and try to straighten out the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">Back then he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">"today, at the age of 28, Sagar strives to bring Nepal to the international stage."</seg>
<seg id="1421">"and his home town right next to Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nepalese wildlife."</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first-class location helps in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">"I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!"</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when suddenly called me Navarre (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida Lodge). he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rapti river a leopard would be.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">"my father had watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the leopard was, and I immediately began to kneel pictures!!"</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar strives for cooperation with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal's nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">"and he should know [it], for he was standing on the tigers face to face,"</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can not disturb itself from the opinion of the sheep while sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Bedtime for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">"also I was on the way home because of the darkness, when suddenly the king of the book heavyweight appeared. he immediately sat down, we look at us and he gazes at me through the Sal-trees!!"</seg>
<seg id="1434">"to promote the protection of wild animals Sagar places the logo" "I click for conservation" "(lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos."</seg>
<seg id="1435">But his passion for promoting Nepalese wildlife and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">"he waited for 22 days, and mostly lived in a tent in order to take pictures of Ottern in the Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation."</seg>

<seg id="1469">"this article was written by Kayonaaz Kalyheia and originally appeared on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international collaborative media organization from India."</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version has been re-published here as part of a content-sharing convention.</seg>
<seg id="1471">"in many parts of India, women have the greatest care to pronounce the name of their husbands or even older men in the family."</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use a pronoun or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">"from Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that because of the social pressure they should respect the husband, as well as fear of the consequences, they should disregard the norm, keep this practice alive."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted from the Indian state of Odisha by a false court and rejected by her family and community after she had addressed a married relatives with names."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"the tradition of calling their wives also not by the name is also common among men. however, they have far less rebuke to fear, if any, they should not follow this practice."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"in the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, among them health workers as well as housewives, entered a unique club and became the main topic of the city quickly."</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">"as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, he is part of the # KhelBadal campaign, which is operated by the community of Video Volunteers and advocates for the exploitation of patriarchy."</seg>
<seg id="1479">"for seven years, Rohini Pap has been working with her video camera to cover practices such as child marriage and banning HIV- and AIDS infected, and leads this club."</seg>
<seg id="1480">She reports on how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video showing Rohini in their discussion was women who do not call their husbands on their names.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the patriarchy with a problem with which women can easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not to speak aloud the name of their husbands is a custom that they all uphold and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not consider this is regarded as deceitful as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">Tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about it until this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning, Rohini, who had never named her husband by name, wanted to try out at home as it runs."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband kept silent for a long time after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him from now on his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">Rohini started their first discussion with this self-confidence in the luggage.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" patriarchy "before. some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected."</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the video projection, the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked every participant to tell her husband's name with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then she asked all," If we can't tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us as they want, does that mean that they do not respect us? "</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equal? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their husbands over their lips," says Rohini Paste from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra over breaking a centuries-old tradition, in which married women can never pronounce the name of their husbands. "</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she was chichled only before her during the whole exercise; another decided to release the whole frustrated frustration against him and his family by cursed him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"in the adrenalin rush to have broken with an ancient custom, the women decided that they would actually try at home to name their husbands by name."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">"in the next few days, Rohini received a variety of reports."</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put in the head: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it before dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"when her mother-in-law gazed at her, she was afraid and said that it was a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said: "Rohini said I should do it.</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in force.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the zinc red dot on the forehead, which shows the Ehestatus:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"I told my husband that I would wear the inox-red dot, if he did it."</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I stopped wearing him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women have not completely stopped, but think they are now in a better position to choose to not wear it on some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">"for many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can share their opinions and goals."</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "we make a trip at each discussion club."</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want women to take care of who could hear," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes for the first time in their lives; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things, for example our identities to our husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to be able to say certain things, no matter how small it is."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"in a panel discussion, we talked about the concept of honour and how it is associated with clothes."</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only supported saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most it's okay, but some wanted a sage-curta to wear a wide shirt over a pair of trousers; they didn't dare."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after a lot of arguments and discussion about the advantages of the choice of clothes, the moral associated with the saris and much more, Rohini smuggled their own pair of Kurtas (upper shirts) into a discussion round so that women could wear them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next, they decided to take a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will do it."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"on the question of whether something has changed in the five months since their first discussion club, Rohini confirms that things are moving slowly:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">"so far, we have only done small steps."</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tasted it a few times, but then stopped to say the name of their husband."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including me, still do it, but only when they are alone and no other family members are there."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnobertin on their forehead at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">Women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like haggling around more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothes - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini declares:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the Video Volunteers community come from discounted groups in India and make videos about stories that are not reported.</seg>

<seg id="1585">"a new system of kidnapping of bald individuals for organ trade, probably for abuses, is alarmed by the police of Zambézia, a province in Mozambique. the local government now called for a number of operations to stop the practice."</seg>
<seg id="1586">"at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Milek, a few kilometers from the border to Malawi."</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was found to be found and part of the organs had been removed.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently led to the use of the organs of shamans in Tanzania and Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1589">"there is local superstition that the head of a man of a bald man could have gold, or could bring wealth, explained the police spokesman of Zambézia to the BBC."</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">"another group, the goal of murders for obscure purposes, are people with albinism."</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led to the fact that the UN 2016 carried out a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice.</seg>

<seg id="1600">"the persecution and murder of cross-headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Morrumbala, province of Zambézia, has cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional shamans, which also indicates that a faith exists, according to which the victims in the head might have power to generate wealth."</seg>

<seg id="1628">The following version is published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of detained Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had been announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized for liver cancer in the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">"in 2009, Liu was sentenced to 11 years in prison for" "Subversion" "following the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto calling for democratic reform in China."</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"the Department of Foreign Affairs in China has referred to Lius case as" an internal affair, "and a spokesman says he did not consider it necessary to discuss this matter with any other country."</seg>
<seg id="1633">"however, China continues to receive calls from the international community, Nobel Prize winner and his wife, poet Liu Xia, or to allow him to be treated abroad."</seg>
<seg id="1634">"while some countries have criticised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others have completely wiped out the issue."</seg>

<seg id="1637">"Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss Liu's case."</seg>
<seg id="1638">"however, a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Liu to be treated abroad."</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway and Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brende have refused to answer questions about Lius release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">"the relationship between China and Norway was kicked off after the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu, although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision."</seg>
<seg id="1642">"diplomatic relations were resumed only in December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume exports to China, as exports have largely been blocked since 2010."</seg>
<seg id="1643">"after spreading the news that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope of unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo."</seg>
<seg id="1644">"due to his detention, he was unable to accept his price."</seg>
<seg id="1645">"during the ceremony, Liu was represented by an empty chair."</seg>

<seg id="1653">"a spokeswoman of the US Embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced that the message agency AFP announced on June 27 that the embassy asked the Chinese authorities not only to release Liu, but also to release his wife Liu Xia from house arrest."</seg>
<seg id="1654">"the invitation of the US embassy relocated a furious response from China, with the statement of the State Department that" no country has the right to interfere and make irresponsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs. ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley shared that China should offer the following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">"protection and freedom, such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his choice, which they claim according to Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations."</seg>
<seg id="1657">"the US senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also adopted a resolution in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Liu and his wife unconditionally."</seg>

<seg id="1666">McCallum continues telling:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"Canada calls on China to uphold its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, and to permit restrictions to exercise these rights."</seg>

<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">"it is my belief that the initiatives he took and which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious, more stable and prosperous China, which in turn contributed to a more peaceful world."</seg>
<seg id="1679">"I felt personally very moved and also encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, signed the Charter 08, which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China."</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">"the question may seem stupid, since Singapore is recognized as an independent state at an international level."</seg>
<seg id="1685">"but according to the Minister of Justice, K. Shanmug, Singapore should be regarded as a city."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has sparked a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the meeting at the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the New York State Bar Association, the minister noted that many people criticised the dominance of Singapore's only political party because they were compared with other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supported Singapore to be regarded as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">No one has questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">"this is, most people commit a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The Cavalierio blog accused the Minister of Justice to "twist the logic" to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious country, one hears that we are ultimately no country."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you're not my country, whose country is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons cited by Shanmug were not very noble: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other" normal "countries, in the face of it, he appeared inevitably undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"on the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently guided by a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"as soon as one reaches the central point of the subject, the good old lyre comes up from the authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, leaving the twisted logic, since it fits better to their power."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"in the end, the last week of Shanmugam given answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judicial, our political system really non-responses."</seg>
<seg id="1703">He tarred corresponding questions in a rational way with non-responses.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls on Shanmug to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"if Singapore is not a country but a city, so to which country belongs to our city..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"in short, I don't understand anything."</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmug would take the trouble to clarify this point insofar as it was paid high to be part of the government of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">"when Anon published his commentary on the blog, he points to the criticisms that one should start reading the entire transcript of the conference, so that one could understand the context of the statements of Shanmug, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Please read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"when he said Singapore is more a" city "than a country," he explained why the elections in Singapore are so unequal, even if we enjoy free and fair elections. "</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore to cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"when he said that Singapore was" "no country," "he obviously did not mean it in that sense!"</seg>
<seg id="1714">"Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmuck, who as the leader of a growing generation, makes such a polemical statement."</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice told of Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1716">"at least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Guard, what I expected - whether I agree with them or not, but that's another thing."</seg>
<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanmug, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I doubt and I am not even sure whether he truly believes it, right associates, and aware of what he is defending."</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review sheds light on Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"did Mr. Shanmuck" "commit a mistake" "or was it a Freudian slip-over speaker?"</seg>
<seg id="1720">"if Singapore is not a country, we are regarded only as an independent and sovereign state?"</seg>
<seg id="1721">"if not, what country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back?"</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique; it is equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">"since he plays an important role inside the cabinet, Mr. Shanmug's statements are of grave importance."</seg>
<seg id="1724">"why do the people of Singapur perform their military service, do they defend only their city but not their country?"</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who does our prime minister have to pay back?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink identity card?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">"journey of a Decade to Bejahung, Singapore is and has always been a city:"</seg>
<seg id="1729">I didn't say what I said...</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have annoyed many people of Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody has ever said Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"I can understand that we often hear statements like" the defense of the country, above all, "etc."</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should rather speak of the defence of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1739">Global Voices recently asked its editors: what is the most misunderstood aspect of your home country?</seg>
<seg id="1740">Your answers will be published here as part of an ongoing series with the rumours uncovered about certain parts of the world and another facet is to be shown.</seg>
<seg id="1741">"the most recent part of this series comes from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan."</seg>
<seg id="1742">"the question that is most asked to me in Japan is," Are you Americans? "</seg>
<seg id="1743">"no, I'm sorry," I answer. "I'm from Canada." since 1994 I live in Japan. "</seg>
<seg id="1744">"depending on what situation the conversation takes place, it is considered polite to show interest in his interlocutor by asking personal questions."</seg>
<seg id="1745">"then most of the time the answer is the default answer:" Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature. "many Canadians probably cook domestic rage when they are held for Americans, but I don't mind."</seg>
<seg id="1746">"for someone who does not know himself, there is little that distinguishes us Canadians of Americans."</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians make a Canadian flag clearly visible on their backpack when they travel.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All love Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Americans however....</seg>
<seg id="1750">"so it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11."</seg>
<seg id="1751">Canadians have always carried small maples on their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours.</seg>

<seg id="1755">"all seem to think, Canada is so great."</seg>
<seg id="1756">We are polite.</seg>
<seg id="1757">"obviously, we say very often" "apologies." ""</seg>
<seg id="1758">Canada is said to be the most tolerant country against ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="1759">We are not as these guys south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We Canadians are nice.</seg>
<seg id="1761">I hate that.</seg>
<seg id="1762">"first, I have many American friends I admire very much."</seg>
<seg id="1763">"it wouldn't matter to me, for example, if you were to be confused with Johnny from Dallas."</seg>
<seg id="1764">With Marc from Austin.</seg>
<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">But there are also some problems with the stamp "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">"first of all, being called" nice "means being idle - like the gentle, gentle, but tragically insignificant figure Ned Flanders from" Die Simpsons "(who has its own Canadian Doppelgänger)."</seg>
<seg id="1769">"if Canada is really a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, this would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that" nice "has no personality."</seg>
<seg id="1770">"there are no corners and edges, nothing that one can encounter."</seg>
<seg id="1771">Being harmless means to be inconspicuous and uninteresting and to earn no attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">"this can be a good thing if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, far away from the things that happen around you."</seg>
<seg id="1773">"I would even go as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone, is a main part of the Canadians."</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own affairs.</seg>
<seg id="1775">"what outsiders refer to as" "nice" "is perhaps simply bold politeness."</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians don't often talk about the fence with their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="1777">"we lack the warm, open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends."</seg>
<seg id="1778">Luckily for us (and for the rest of the world) Justin Trudeau stepped onto the stage to show that Canadians are more than just "nice."</seg>

<seg id="1780">"a popular pop band, famous in Thailand, has released a music video that parods the Junta who seized power in 2014 and in spite of their promise to restore the civilian government, the country continues to reign."</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells the rules that his girlfriend does.</seg>
<seg id="1782">"although not explicitly political, the music video still refers indirectly to the continued military domination of the junta."</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video to the song was a huge success.</seg>
<seg id="1785">"within the first three days alone, the video uploaded on Facebook was shared 1.254 times and got 8,800 likes."</seg>
<seg id="1786">"last month, even the Charlie Chaplin video" Der Dictator "was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists asked the public to watch this video."</seg>
<seg id="1787">"the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, especially as regards the situation of the country under the Junta rule."</seg>
<seg id="1788">"take a look at these photos of the video, which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has persistently tracked over the past three years."</seg>
<seg id="1789">"the" 44 rules of girls "may refer to the draconian section 44 of the preliminary constitution, which gives the supreme commander of the army absolute decision making on important national issues."</seg>
<seg id="1790">"the 11th rule:" "change your attitude" "refers to the notorious programme for the" "change in employment" "of journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other people who are viewed by the Junta as critics."</seg>
<seg id="1791">"the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime, whose vague and unclear regulations are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state."</seg>
<seg id="1792">"for this purpose, a new unit was established in the army that monitors online content and prosecuted persons who were accused of having slandered the monarchy."</seg>

<seg id="1796">"one of the problems the Junta continues to pursue is to buy expensive U-boats, even though security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money."</seg>
<seg id="1797">"in the video it is even shown how individuals are thrown into a black delivery van, before putting them into an internment camp, another problem."</seg>
<seg id="1798">"some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused" "confusion" "in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences, should they offend the monarchy."</seg>

<seg id="1895">"Concepción González Ramírez runs a small hotel in Tapachula, in the state of Chiapas, at the border from Mexico to Guatemala."</seg>
<seg id="1896">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1897">This article by Amy Bracken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI.org and will be published with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="1898">"on the path of migrants, crossing Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality."</seg>
<seg id="1899">"I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, located on the border to Guatemala."</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">"it is led by a 59-year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink spectacle frame and gold-coloured earrings in teddy bear."</seg>
<seg id="1902">"she is called Concepción González Ramírez, and was born in Tapachula and grew up there."</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for about 2.50 dollars the night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign to the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Haitian migrants arrive here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, Mrs. Ramírez talks, people get to the full small busses and from the upper part of the coast they start crying:" Mama Africa! "</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you mum Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">"currently it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has already received 200 guests at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"there are only 24 rooms, some also slept outside on cardboard boxes."</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to reject anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">"she also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are ill, they buy drugs that they cannot pay for them, they massage them with a balm the feet exhausted by the long journey."</seg>
<seg id="1914">"Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived recently."</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa is an appropriate nickname for Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">"the Sebastiao family (with her daughter Merrui, who has a Yoghurtbeard) posing with Concepción González Ramírez."</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," "he answered with a smile." "I really feel it suits her because African women are very nice women."</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very affectionate.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"you have lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa." Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track, "explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti."</seg>
<seg id="1926">He says that the Haitians and the Africans often travel together and that the Africans speak to Whatsapp by Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">"like many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"when the Brazilian economy became weaker, he started his journey to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will contact Mrs. Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again," he answers smiling. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. Ramírez tells her that her guests often send text messages when they have left to greet them or tell her about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"she doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to cook chicken like in Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"Mrs. Ramírez is perhaps very well known here, but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through tapachula."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"at the other end of the city, a blind alley leads to Jesús Valenzuela."</seg>
<seg id="1937">Valenzuela and his family immigrated this winter in their little house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">"he started to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar the night."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"at the moment 25 people are there, mainly Haitians."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking station outside."</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I have lived in the United States," he says. "I have experienced what they are experiencing."</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. that's why I give them my support.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"after having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants who travel through Tapachula come from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them."</seg>
<seg id="1948">"José Antonio Cordova Meléndez told me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children, who wanted to blackmail him without having a plan."</seg>
<seg id="1949">"in Tapachula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown, a single person, offered him her roof."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"a few months later, the family still lives there and she tries to decide where to go the next step."</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"in the corridors, the passengers quietly consult their phones."</seg>
<seg id="1953">"a minibus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, most of them from Somalia."</seg>
<seg id="1954">"Ms. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic, because of those who have gone away."</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother she leaves in her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">"there is one of her daughter with African hair spots she has made an art girl, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old."</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sadly as she briefly presents her.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya se fueron," she repeats every time. "they have already gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a monitoring app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjiang by Twitter users to see the weather in Xinjang.</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the inhabitants of Xinjiang, ethnic minorities in western China, are forced to install spyware on their phones."</seg>
<seg id="1962">"on July 10, the mobile users in the Tianshan area of the city of Urumqi have received a mobile phone notification in which they advise the district government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or" "Web Cleaning" ")."</seg>
<seg id="1963">"in the message, it is said that the app" "prevents access to terrorist information." ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">"however, the authorities could also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="1965">"according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture because they, shortly after they had installed the app, had exchanged messages with a private WeChat group."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"in the communication of the police, the app was able to detect and prosecute the sources and distribution channels of terrorists, along with" illegal religious "activities and" harmful information "including videos, images, eBooks and documents."</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangen's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">"Jingwang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom."</seg>
<seg id="1969">"the main function is blocking pornographic web pages, from online fraud, trojans and phishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network."</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with the minors for minors is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">"for example, the" remote control "could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate the home network of a person or steal from it."</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">"while news about digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experience of users in larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often gloomy for those who live in remote, crowded ethnic minorities such as Xinjiang and Tibet."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"to limit disturbances and discontent in the areas of conflict, the authorities often arrange extreme acids and surveillance measures, as well as routine Internet shutdowns."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"the Twitter-based media outlet" Images from mainland China, "published censored news in China, showed photos from a checkpoint where policemen randomly checked the inhabitants to see if they had installed the monitoring app."</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian ensure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">"if you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, you might be imprisoned for up to 10 days."</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced people to use devices designed for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity through the rest-growing technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from mainland China" (the most important part of it) also published a Jingwang product description, which shows that the software can uplift the application requirement of a Windows operating system and thus receives unlimited access to the computer's hard drive. "</seg>
<seg id="1985">"after installing Jingwang, computers and mobile phones are used in Xinjiang to electronic handcuffs."</seg>
<seg id="1986">The regulations in Jingwang may be a response to the instructions of the town council to minimize the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">"all branches of government, public authorities and affiliated institutions, including universities and research institutions, are required to follow the Cybersecurity office's instructions when operating their computers and communication devices."</seg>
<seg id="1988">"a recent report by Freedom House, an American human rights organization, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:"</seg>
<seg id="1989">"the authorities published in Xinjiang on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi to register their" personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks, and media memory cards "at the local police."</seg>
<seg id="1990">"the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any" terrorist "videos. however, this action violates the rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a number of other possible offences, including those relating to peaceful religious or political communications."</seg>

<seg id="2001">"they arrested me and my father three times, but that was not enough for me to learn" my lesson, "as the boss of the Security Service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure."</seg>
<seg id="2002">He proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Five young people were torn away from the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest.</seg>

<seg id="2006">"for the first time it was quiet, motionless, at the wrong time even if I had no high demands on a city that was stuffed into the arteries with state security organisms and their accomplices."</seg>
<seg id="2007">"in the third night, things had calmed down after the power supply in the neighborhood ceased to work."</seg>
<seg id="2008">I interrupted the silence by screaming several times "Allahu Akbar" from my roof.</seg>
<seg id="2009">I heard my voice resisted by the silence.</seg>

<seg id="2011">I was not alone.</seg>
<seg id="2012">"many friends, true friends joined me; we allied ourselves to a magnificent picture fulfilling my expectations."</seg>
<seg id="2013">"in such a moment you realize that you release the mind from the lamp, but it is simply not interested in the least."</seg>
<seg id="2014">"I received a call from my father:" "get ready, we meet at the military security building."</seg>
<seg id="2015">He put up.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Then I learned the following: no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can give you back your voice after you screened it all the way to the office of the security service out of the body.</seg>
<seg id="2017">I arrived there.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The Colonel Ghassan stood there with several of his men; my father was already there as I now.</seg>

<seg id="2020">His hateful eyes focused on me.</seg>
<seg id="2021">And you're trusting what to look into my eyes and not on the ground!</seg>
<seg id="2022">What I did then has nothing to do with courage.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"I was 18 years old, it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building."</seg>
<seg id="2024">"perhaps it was about my foolishness, vanity; perhaps in the revolution."</seg>
<seg id="2025">I was so sure of my cause when I replied: "I wouldn't have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday.</seg>

<seg id="2027">"it was the shortest conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me, and yet I don't regret a word of what I said."</seg>

<seg id="2030">The stench of this cursed movement lies in my nose to this day.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"he became a" syndrome, "a mental torture, which I was subjected to months."</seg>
<seg id="2032">I crossed the courtyard.</seg>
<seg id="2033">In the first office I leave everything I wear with myself.</seg>
<seg id="2034">"then again through the yard and into the second office, which leads through a corridor to the individual cells."</seg>

<seg id="2055">"thus the secret was revealed: to protect the state security against us and prevent us from exposing the traitor and terrorists in us, they speak in the alawitic dialect - so they played out their sectarian blackmail and betrayed the narrow viewpoint of their world view."</seg>
<seg id="2056">This is not a house that is not a country here; it is a curse that they call coexistence to transform the criminals of their clans into a hero.</seg>
<seg id="2057">"I enter the auditorium and meet at Abu Imad, a slender and stocky man; at least he appears to me."</seg>
<seg id="2058">"he begins a" pleasant "conversation, in spite of the facial expressions that are derailed to him:" my boy, you are still young, you can start so much more important with your life than to join this diary and protest on demonstrations that will eventually come to an end anyway. "</seg>
<seg id="2059">I didn't answer.</seg>
<seg id="2060">I got used to it not to reply.</seg>
<seg id="2061">I really can't say exactly when insults and punches after a friendly conversation have become an ordinary means of communication for me.</seg>
<seg id="2062">When and how that happened was unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">"some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished, even though I had done nothing to earn this punishment."</seg>
<seg id="2064">On punishment in all their diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2065">His command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2066">He calls this affectionate "confession."</seg>
<seg id="2067">It starts with a plastic pipe which probably comes from the cloaks.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Your executioner rejoices in your cries.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"give him the pleasure, you cannot compete with him, and you cannot withhold your cries."</seg>
<seg id="2070">"my cries were not enough for him yet, so they exchanged the tube with a cable."</seg>
<seg id="2071">"during my first arrest, I asked myself whether the investigator had worked as a garbage collector in the past, or whether it belonged to the normal working equipment."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"they had intertwined four cables in order to present us, from their point of view, great invention of a huge cable."</seg>

<seg id="2075">"the executioner noticed the cooling and didn't take pleasure in it, which was why he resorted to an electrically charged staff."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"electricity flowed my whole body, enough to supply my whole neighborhood."</seg>

<seg id="2102">"Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones, has something to do with his identity as a" Palestinian prisoner of the second generation, "he calls himself even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think so," Hdaib stresses. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" "I think so, because I am a human being" "while he spends in water-dissolved nest-café in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan. in this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset."</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a hot young junk has little to do with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">"basically, the gap of lukewarm coffee and the swaying of the Kent cigarette in the nose are primarily speaking of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky, especially if you have a look at the neighbouring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, it is easy to do basic things - like drinking water in public during Ramadan - in order not to land in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, Jordan's Interior Ministry announced a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some parliamentarians who support the Islamic action front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual act contradicts Hamed Sinno, the cultural and traditional norms of the country, and the main reason for the concert taboo."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"the deputies and former press spokesmen of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub in an interview with CNN said that the concert" "just" "had been cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the singer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism which questioned the proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes across the region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, Mashrou 'Leila rated the Jordanian people as a" progressive supporter of human rights, "who continue to advocate an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement probably should not be simply the rhetoric, but in fact reflected a more and more clearly crystallizing reality in Jordan, which appears clearly in Hdaibs's work."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016, Hdaib moved to Leibe's traditional sex men by completing his vision of the fate of Arab women who have marital sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the picture shows the skeleton of an apparently broken, unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the canvas."</seg>
<seg id="2118">"it is surrounded by a red lake, perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should trust."</seg>
<seg id="2119">"in the past few years, the number of 'Honorary Mordes' has increased in Jordan - the unofficial outwardly left."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"according to human rights Watch, the number of honour killings reached its peak in 2016; however, it is still aggravated that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure to support the women who have attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a crime against crime in 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can" "remain in prison for an indefinite period of time", "and for their release is often a long years of bureaucracy and the family's guarantee that nothing will happen to the woman."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"also, Hdaib's music enjoys great popularity and is well known not to shy away from topics that have long been considered taboo in his country."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he is not able to separate his music, which is full of explicit appearances on sexuality, freedom and expression."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"politics was given to me," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2126">"in a song called" Edward Sa'ed, "Hdaib attacks the question of the Palestinian identity."</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in Ghareeb the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of the songs that are political at the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">"in March 2016, Hdaib released a song titled" Santandano. ""</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated noticeably often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the further course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market on which one, in his words," can get what you want "- be it faith or non-faith, heterogeneity or homosexuality."</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noted that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay men and lesbians and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals were heavily censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya, to later note that his comments from the context were torn, twisted and censored."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but streamed only a edited version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today, Hdaib acquires openly for the Arabic LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance towards homosexuals does not correspond to Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentions Abu Nueva, a poet of the eighth century, who still remains in memory thanks to his homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib is asking himself: if Abu Nuh, who was to work on behalf of the caliph, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians not?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was canceled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the hashemic kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression, and that progressive voices are silenced."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian intelligence service held several former governmental decrees and members of the teacher association, arguing that they had critically expressed themselves on comments in social media regarding the problems rooted deep in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of this, the concert of Hdaibs is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has led Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - that's how Hdaib - consists of slow, thoughtful and internal changes. he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"in the end, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without interventions from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also about" experiencing them. ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region will be approached with the help of music, art and literature of genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, cluster munitions, and artificially controlled democracies. at least he hopes."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until the time has come, Hdaib will continue to rap and therefore resist."</seg>

<seg id="2150">"these big, extravagant warrior dolls are so fantastic!!!"</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it is assumed that there is a variation of the Tanabata Festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the feasts, drums and dance marched over more than a thousand years, in order to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, emissary, to knee."</seg>

<seg id="2167">"rarely, outward appearances and bodily care were as important as in this story, as they help to keep the Peruvian youth away from crime and to promote a legitimate occupation like that of the hairdresser."</seg>
<seg id="2168">"El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of the capital Lima, a region with a very high crime rate where street robbery and illegal drug trade are everyday."</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region would not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">"at the same time, Peru, like many other Central and South American countries, is experiencing a rising demand for aesthetic services for men."</seg>
<seg id="2171">"the trend, the appearance and consequently the unusual hairstyles of famous athletes like Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to getting more normal citizens into the experienced hands of hairdressers who can recreate these lavish hairstyles."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the unprecedented demand for hairstyles, which go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity, has even inspired a yearly event, the dressers of the hairdressers" Batalla de Barberos, "which has been taking place since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2173">"experts face each other there to show who can create the most eccentric hooks, as you can see in the following video (more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos)."</seg>
<seg id="2174">"educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to persuade young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and to receive training in the hair style, which allows them to find work."</seg>
<seg id="2175">"motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion."</seg>

<seg id="2178">Colombia: love Letters to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the edited version of the article "Love messages to guerrilla fighters" published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not much more important, people who feel alienated, affectionate affection?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">"this was precisely the question of the young Colombian activist Leonardo Párraga of the Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation, who encouraged young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"recently, their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to it: after years of negotiation, the Colombian government signed a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary armed forces Colombia), which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">International was considered so significant that Colombian president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">"before the Colombians, however, there is still a long way until one can speak of a real reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"guerrilla fighters who lived in illegal camps for many years, subjected to a war rhetoric and carried out arms around the clock, must now re-integrate themselves into the lives of civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society, once again accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases, has become accustomed to deep hatred towards guerrilla fighters, must now support them in their ranks and support them in building a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians could join together and help in the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">"and that's exactly what they did: until now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters, to welcome them back to society."</seg>
<seg id="2193">"the aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerilla fighter, which should then be handed over personally."</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as Inspiration for the Campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for the reconciliation was born on the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to speak briefly with Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"this explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valentine's Day, but those who need them much more needful."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he planned, he talked about sharing his love with people this year, who needed the most urgent response."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"the plan to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, who now have to find their place in society and build up a new life." the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace, "they say."</seg>
<seg id="2199">"until now, more than 2000 letters were collected within the framework of the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities in Colombia like Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá."</seg>
<seg id="2201">I would never have thought that someone would forgive me</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were submitted in one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipality of Cali and Leonardo from the Bogotal Foundation traveled to the camp to deliver the letters personally."</seg>
<seg id="2204">"the members of the FARC behaved as they had previously done, in order to accept the orders of their leaders."</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they received no orders, but letters full of support for people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for everyone involved." it's incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between, "the political scientist Manuela Jiménez Avila told later."</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, an employee of the governor of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after we handed over the letters, a former fighter took me through the camp of the guerrilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I looked into one of the" Cameras "(a kind of hut where the guerrilla fighters live), I saw a guerilla fighter who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go down, because beside him on the bed there was a MGL garnet, a deadly weapon in Sleeping Beauty."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"I still spoke to him and said," "Hello, what are they doing?" "he answered," "I answer a letter that someone wrote to me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never in my life someone wrote something so beautiful, that's why I answer it." "suddenly the tears ran over the cheeks."</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him completely and sat down beside the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was sorry about the war, he was sorry to be all the years of loyal companion to this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life than war. to join the FARC, was the only way to keep him and his six brothers before starvation." I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes. "</seg>
<seg id="2217">"but now I know that there is a society outside, waiting for us with open arms."</seg>
<seg id="2218">"so far, I have only learned how to deal with weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where there is peace, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"at the start of the discussion, students and some FARC leaders joined a panel discussion."</seg>
<seg id="2222">"the students were all grown up as already war, and the FARC was already active in secret."</seg>
<seg id="2223">"this is why the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process:" for many years we have experienced how the social injustice of the state impacted on the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the possibility of developing ourselves to a political party, we can help shape society in this country more just. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"a goal of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles," one of them said. "</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"listening to these people who had never heard heard and had no choice right now, and realizing that the people I often saw as monsters and even hate people with beautiful feelings turned around by their living conditions and their environment, was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"the reality in which the country lives, hurts me."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforts me that all men, including those who killed and done so much damage, can teach us something and give a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo González, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote, for example, Darío de Jesús Monsalve, the Archbishop of Cali, the following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombians were prophesied that peace would reign after disarmament.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to take up arms, stand up and protest for their rights. and that is fully justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we of the FARC now focus on peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"that is why we call upon all the defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, for we know from our own experience that nothing is easy. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"there will be many obstacles on our way, but together we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2243">"gay and queer people living in the Caucasus region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination, physical and sexual violence and blackmail."</seg>
<seg id="2244">"with terror, activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months on the persecution of gay men in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2245">But the threat that hangs over the LGBTQ community there is not just about overnight.</seg>
<seg id="2246">"OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a transsexual woman from Grosny, who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is currently happening in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2247">"several months ago, the LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya conquered international headlines after reports were published that dealt with the spread, torture and killing of queer men in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in Nowaya Gazeta; she threw a light on the methods of the Chechen authorities who arrested suspicious queer men and put them into secret prisons in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"they have brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">"Sabrina, a woman with a woman, was born in Grosny and grew up there."</seg>
<seg id="2251">Since her childhood she felt that she was actually a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2252">"when she grew up, she became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, so she moved to Moscow."</seg>
<seg id="2253">"after a group had experienced Chetschenen from the gender equation of their landlady, the hunt for Sabrina was opened."</seg>
<seg id="2254">"in the end, she moved to the United States for fear of her life."</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I was a volunteer helper in a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I was told that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"it was a friend from Dagestan, a woman who was in trouble."</seg>
<seg id="2258">"she had no money, so I took her without hesitation."</seg>
<seg id="2259">"while I tried to help her, someone from whom I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread them all over the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent them to his Chechnya friends, with the following message:" then there are no more men in Chechnya, who can remove this shame? "</seg>
<seg id="2260">"after that, the photos of my documents through the whole WhatsApp did the round."</seg>
<seg id="2261">I was attacked on 10 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="2262">"when I was about to bring out a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a male voice saying:" here's a gift for you from your uncle. "</seg>
<seg id="2263">"when I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I didn't hurt."</seg>
<seg id="2264">"then I heard a sentence, but this time in Chechnya:" how long do you want to dishonor the family, you scandspot? "</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">"I just know that it was a young man, not 30 years old."</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and finally woke up in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">"apparently, some women had everything included and started screaming."</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">"in the hospital, I learned that I had two wounds in my right lung wing."</seg>
<seg id="2272">"OC Media: in which case wings were laid, in which of the men or women?"</seg>
<seg id="2273">"Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and put me to the women."</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very thankful for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">"when I first read his name on his office door, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name."</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for being respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">"last February, I received threats."</seg>
<seg id="2280">"they called me, wrote to me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown."</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">"they asked me to send me back to Chechnya, to prove that all this was a lie."</seg>
<seg id="2284">"they asked absurd demands: some said to me, I must prove it by running on top without going through the streets; others wanted me to appear on official television in Grosny and say that I didn't change my gender that everything was only bad things, and Photoshop."</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have particle size C - what should I have said on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people once talked to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"they said to her," They have brought a monster to the world that has corrupted not only your family, but the entire republic. "</seg>
<seg id="2290">"we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you have to disappear from here."</seg>
<seg id="2291">It was too much of my mother and she put a rope around his neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">"fortunately, the neighbours came and saved them."</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with darkened windows and a number plate with a 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"after it had happened for the third time, it became clear to me that there was something rotten."</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you fly?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for security reasons, I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with her help I left the country, but then something incredible happened."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">"shortly before I left Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived."</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought them without registering, without identification, without everything."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in to the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my cell phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"at the moment when I wanted to call my mother via WhatsApp, I received a message:" "you don't believe, you're safe, just because you have left the country?"</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people know at which hotel you are stuck. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove it to you: it is the number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine this?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, we do not talk about gender equality, which is a taboo theme."</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditionally Caucasian elements I still wear in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"as much as I wish, I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I always say that, as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chat with camera, I really try to look like the person I remember from her past - that is, my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what do your friends, those who have stayed here?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">"for him, I needed current information on the situation in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who sat in argun for a half and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he said that during Ramadan none of the people were arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan failed to wait, and he did not lock a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"with that, I mean they probably invite the relatives who take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end demand a proof that the so-called" honor "has experienced through blood satisfaction."</seg>
<seg id="2329">"OC Media: are there still gay men held in these secret prisons, too?"</seg>
<seg id="2330">"Sabrina: a friend of mine says, there are not so many."</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, especially those who have no wealthy relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to settle for Kadyrows."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they are held there so that one can later present them as terrorists."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say," "If they are killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim they had attacked any village or military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people were not simply disappeared, they were deliberately immersed in order to radicalise."</seg>
<seg id="2336">"OC Media: is that only a guess, or do you have a source for this information?"</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was incarcerated one and a half months in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard has grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new from them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They just took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so-called Lord, that person himself was there when these people were taken."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"until now they were not introduced as bandits, but there were no reports about that. we suspect that such actions are quite possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would it not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people who belong to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already occurred in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think already before 2003 I was already known in the whole of Grosny when I was still living there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In the grave!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999, when the Sharia was applied, I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia originally intended to bring us to" "civilisation", "but in the end it was thrown back to the Stone Age."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">"Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had dyed eyelashes, wore baldness jeans and short tops."</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Security of Sharia has never curbed a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in front of the Russian theatre in Grozny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, met a whole group of people like me."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several banks stood, and the whole city knew of it; they knew why men, young people, met there."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"in the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is," Don't worry about the misfortune of another. ""</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to children when they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so they just closed their eyes before you, because they believed you were sick?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">"they never insulted me, never hunted and never struck."</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this time of grace last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long before Kadyrov entered the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began talking about morality on television."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he spoke not about us per se, but primarily about the behaviour of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">"nevertheless, one could feel how people began to change in the city."</seg>
<seg id="2368">"who had smiled and laughed before, looked at you at once with suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home I could feel how the situation in the republic was steadily deteriorating.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"apart from that, I am still active as an activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we organize teacreffs, meetings, I escort them to the hospital and help them to get food kinds."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't spend a cent for it.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I rattled to the places of refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you have a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"so nature, that has nothing to do with religion."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"this is exactly the same as Tschetschenen, who want to make you white with foam in front of the mouth, that there are no gays with them."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the Dageants have which, the Cabardines have which, the Russians also have which; on the whole planet they exist - but" not in Chechnya. ""</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I come from there, so it is unpleasant for me to hear something like that."</seg>
<seg id="2387">I met so many men here from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims fasting in the mosque and fasting during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">"you know many think about transient to men who love men, and they believe that you change their sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things, two different ways of feeling to be exact, different attitudes of life."</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel myself in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"sorry I'm going to be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago."</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn against an increase of suicide among the impoverished Arab Ahwazi community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">Iran's Ahraz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"since the last few months, there has been a strong increase in suicide attacks."</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photo of the Arab workers in Iran was made available by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahraz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: use with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the self-burning of a man, called Jassim Moramazi on August 27, reversed the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, which is marked by poverty and unemployment, into the spotlight."</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahwaz in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"he suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability to pay for his family, so Ahwazi human rights groups who want to work in Ahraz and remain anonymous."</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube kept the moments after he had ignited himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">"some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahwaz."</seg>
<seg id="2405">"according to local sources, the burns were so strong that the doctors could do nothing."</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2407">"it was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ahwazi-minority, and activists on the spot warn that even more men could take life."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"the Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Hamid manifesto, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - hanged."</seg>
<seg id="2409">"their stories have one thing in common: they were all family fathers who felt helpless and unable to follow their families due to their persecution by the Iranian government, helpless and unable to feed their families."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"Arab Ahwazi are suffering from poverty, unemployment and discrimination"</seg>
<seg id="2411">"the region, based in which a large part of the Arab Ahwazi community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it hard for the indigenous Arab population to deny their livelihoods."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"a century ago, the Arab ancestor was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlavi monarchy assumed power and in 1925 attempts to end ethnic autonomy in Iran."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"in the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran and some of the most profitable and valuable areas for Iranian agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"despite these valuable resources, the regional economy is still developing only slowly, and the native population gets little of this wealth."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"it is often victims of untreated diseases, hunger and deprivation."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Iranian regime systematically refuses Ahrazi-Arabians to create jobs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries."</seg>
<seg id="2417">"the government has also built a variety of dams that divert water from the Arabic areas into the Persian areas, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom lie."</seg>
<seg id="2418">"these dams have only led to worsen the devastation caused by dryness caused by drought, and destroying local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry."</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab ahawzi youth increased to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">"Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian general director for cooperatives, work and social welfare, reported that 5% of Ahwazis who are looking for a job, completed a primary school, completed 55% of secondary school, and 45% have a university degree."</seg>
<seg id="2421">Systematic strategy... aimed at annihilating the spirit of national resistance</seg>
<seg id="2422">"Karim Dohimoi, an Iranian genealogical human rights activist with residing in London, told Global Voices that the present situation, a mixture of" poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination, "leads to a" high rise "of the number of suicide among young Ahwazi men."</seg>
<seg id="2423">The reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians emerging in Ahraz and an anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">"since functionaries and institutions do not prefer to hire Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors."</seg>
<seg id="2425">"this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime, aimed at annihilating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their livelihood outside their homeland."</seg>
<seg id="2426">"there are people who had to change their first and last name in order to hide their belonging to the Ahwazi and so be employed, because even Arabic names are not tolerated at the workplace, let alone the speaking of the Arabic language or wearing Arabic clothes."</seg>
<seg id="2427">"given the circumstances surrounding the Arab Ahrazi, human rights activists smash alarm before the situation becomes explosive."</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world wakes up and takes note of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I don't identify with feminism, even with the intersectional"</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. recorded by: Pixabay. released under the CC0 Creative Commons license.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the website of Afroféminas. the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"when I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women who call themselves as intersectional feminists - react with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we should generally be all feminists.</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, despite the same education, women still earn less money than men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">Women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women sooner or later encounter a glass ceiling in various areas of life, and that discrimination on the basis of sex is still spreading across the many different countries and beliefs."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">"I am convinced, and I suffer double and triple."</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"yet: when I come to speak on skin colour, on racism, on black cis women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; when I mention how we have always been abused with racism and discrimination, both in and out of feminist movement, many white feminists decide to remain silent."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"however, they all agree that women - all women - should come together to" lift up their voices and sing "Kumbaya, my Lord," to achieve equality (some) of women. "</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they do not want to talk that in addition to sexualised violence there is an institutionalised form of racist motivated violence that we are subjected to black women in a twofold manner.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnicities and places of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">"black girls and girls with a migration background often refer to school as white girls, due to obvious integration problems."</seg>
<seg id="2452">"or that women in black spheres and women are exposed to a higher risk of migratory backgrounds, to suffer domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women."</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand, I want all the women, all men and all men of every skin color have the same rights; on the other hand, I can not join a movement in whose center the white woman stands, who refuses to take injustices in her mind, which refers both to sex as well as on the skin color of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my membership in a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has rejected me and countless other black women over and over again.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"Sojourner complained in her speech in 1851:" "am I not a woman?" "and I too refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a dehumanised and marginalized being in a historical sense."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I refuse to join groups who, in addition, absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropriation to promote their egocentric program."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overlap of skin colour and gender, as some of them continue to mention the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women attempt to honour them for the better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although the intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different backgrounds a home and to isolate themselves from the white feminism, there is still the word" feminism "in its name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I prefer to release myself completely from feminism and join the movement of Womanism, which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman, rather than focusing on a white-feminist paradigm, which is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a new phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and go into the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clan Hudson Weems, the author of the book Africana, possibly: reclaiming clock (e.g.: Africa-Womanismus: as we recapture ourselves) speaks of how we can defend ourselves in this way, in which they can also create spaces where the cultural, spiritual, spiritual, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped which constitute the black woman."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself of the hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement by which the black woman is affected."</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I can lift black women and women from other cultures because I exist in this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2464">"due to my dark skin and my being's existence, I am recognized as a woman as part of this paradigm."</seg>
<seg id="2465">"I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment where my life has neither gone over nor ignored, nor rejected."</seg>
<seg id="2466">Paddling against pollution: a man's mission to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations</seg>
<seg id="2467">"this article by Todd Reubold was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that reports on international efforts to solve environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="2468">"as part of a content-sharing agreement, this article will be published again."</seg>
<seg id="2469">Nabil musa travelled again and again over the past 7 years - mostly with surfboard or in canoeing - with a special concern of the Kurdistan Region in Iraq. his mission is aimed at making people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations.</seg>
<seg id="2470">In this documentary by Emily Kinskey we follow Musa who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church.</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was still a child," Musa tells. "</seg>
<seg id="2472">"scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war, the construction of dams, pollution and uncontrolled development, will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="2473">"Musa is a member of the NGO Waterkeepers Iraq - a subsidiary of Waterkeeper Alliance - who is committed to protecting the rivers, streams and waterways in Iraq as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources."</seg>
<seg id="2474">"at the end of the video, Musa summarizes the urgency and importance of his work on a question:" if we had no water any more, how would we survive? ""</seg>
<seg id="2475">"this video was produced, filmed and edited for Ensia by Emily Kinskey, a documentary film based in Erbil, Iraq, in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="2476">"the focus of their work lies on persecuted, little noteworthy subcultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative videography and new multimedia techniques, with which help oppressed communities can tell their stories in their own way."</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the shortened and edited version of the article "The Wave of Violence Against Women in Paraguay" by ctural. the article belongs to the series # PortsMujer (# gralicheinefraubin) reported on the wave of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the affected people.</seg>
<seg id="2482">"a police commissioner told Ada Báez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-partner, who had become violent against her."</seg>
<seg id="2483">"since the end of their relationship, some time has elapsed and the police said that their statement would be put on the files, but more can't be done."</seg>
<seg id="2484">"when another woman appeared to Balbuena for mistreatment, the Ada Báez's accurate display was also useful."</seg>
<seg id="2485">"a few days later, the second woman moved back to her ad."</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"in general, if women refund ads, they generally do not receive support from the state."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse. this also explains why only 20% of all women, who admit to being victims of violence, report to the law enforcement authorities at all."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"club1 strikes and statistic 2 Invisible mistreatment and a legal system that does not unterlie 3 Paraguay Law: good approach, poor implementation strikes and statistics"</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is difficult to determine how many women are really mistreated, says Myrian González, researcher on gender issues at the Centro de Documentación y Edison, a social science research institution in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2491">The available numbers are however alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015, the District Attorney Office held 9600 advertisements for domestic violence. 70% of them were violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">"there were more than 5,000 ads for domestic violence in the courts of peace. here too 86% of the ads of women came."</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the advertisements, 40% of women reported that they were physically abused, 55% of women spoke of mental abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2496">But these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the Paraguayan women's minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually shown." "on every woman who is reported in Paraguay for psychic abuse, 9 women who do not do this."</seg>
<seg id="2498">"on every woman who is refunded because of physical abuse, two women who do not do this," she explained at the end of 2014. "</seg>
<seg id="2499">"since genocide is not an own crime in Paraguay, law enforcement agencies cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2500">"by August 2016 alone, journalists numbered at least 12 cases of murder in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2501">The Coordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases in which women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">"according to their estimates, every ten days in Paraguay died due to violence by men."</seg>
<seg id="2503">"a shield with the inscription:" "without complicity". "# Non-Less" Photo by Jessie Johfran Pérez. use with kind permission. "</seg>
<seg id="2504">"invisible mistreatment, and a legal system that does not undermine"</seg>
<seg id="2505">"before Mariana Brítez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she called him the names of all her former friends."</seg>
<seg id="2506">"in the beginning she didn't want to do it, but then she said. this should always be regretted."</seg>
<seg id="2507">"today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos. but for two years she bore the psychological violence, one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult recognizable:"</seg>
<seg id="2508">I would never have thought that I would once become a victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"when I read about it before, I always thought that this happens only to women who are too subservient because they are deceived by violent men."</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about the maltreatment by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">"without naming names, she wrote articles on Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated them."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically as to whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had fallen from Carlos so long and didn't leave it earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse would at least have a certain complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2516">"Victoria Santos, who is not from Paraguay, fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner abuse her."</seg>
<seg id="2517">"Victoria is a member of the Yo te Creo network (" I believe you "), which consists of women who are all in some way victims of abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2518">"in the group, they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other."</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything started with mental mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her affluent partner even managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he started beating them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">"Victoria's ads with the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives, they did not receive any support."</seg>
<seg id="2524">"she led a trial against her former partner, who developed into an impenetrable legal fight between Paraguay and her home country, in which it was mainly about money, power and the influence of her former partner."</seg>
<seg id="2525">Paraguays laws: good approach to poor implementation</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay there are many laws, which are very good, but not applied."</seg>
<seg id="2527">"the display of abuse is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary," "says Victoria Santos."</seg>
<seg id="2528">"Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, also sees great problems in the application of the laws in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2529">"on 10 August 2016, a draft law was discussed in the Paraguayan Parliament under the hashtag # PorEllas (# for you)."</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the movement # NiUnaMenos (# NonUnieWeniger) are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law stipulates that Femicid has to declare and punish harsher as it is already in the neighboring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">"so the bill was modified in some points to also win the deputies for the law, which feared that the way for the decriminalisation of abortions is prohibited, which is currently prohibited in Paraguay and will be punished with up to five years imprisonment."</seg>
<seg id="2533">"the original bill envisaged, the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) procedural costs that the victims of violence must wear themselves, if they just want to refund and receive a safe accommodation to impose the state."</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">"in Paraguay, maltreatment is seen as part of interpersonal relationships."</seg>
<seg id="2536">"here, a rethinking must take place, so that violence is no longer seen as something normal."</seg>
<seg id="2537">"whoever is silent in the face of these facts, complicates and contributes to the fact that the perpetrators are offended."</seg>
<seg id="2538">We have to refund the ad until ill-treatment is no longer considered normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">"on 10 November 2016, the law was passed in the Paraguayan Senate. before that, parts of the law had been changed. among other things, a passage was cancelled, which the partners called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2540">The opinions about the changes are coming apart.</seg>

<seg id="2547">"more than a year ago, the Italian authorities closed the independent Arab-language newspaper Azamn because of their reporting on corruption in the sultant."</seg>

<seg id="2549">"two other editors of Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari and Zaher Al-Abri, were also arrested and tried, but later released."</seg>
<seg id="2550">"Oman has been governed since 1970 by Sultan Qabus ibn Said, who came to power after he had dismissed his father, Said ibn Taimur, through a coup d" état. "</seg>
<seg id="2551">"since then, in addition to his role as the only sultan, he has been suffering the most important offices in the country: Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Supreme Commander, Minister of Finance, Foreign Minister, Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank."</seg>
<seg id="2552">"Sultan's rule is marked by the persistent efforts of security forces, especially domestic secrecy, civil liberties, including freedom of press, restricting and torture human rights defenders, independent journalists, bloggers and other activists."</seg>
<seg id="2553">"the authorities will systematically restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights and prevent citizens, including activists, to express their views on public affairs of the country, such as corruption in public authorities and institutions both online and offline."</seg>
<seg id="2554">"the attack on the newspaper Azamn, its closure and the incarceration of three of its editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2555">Azamn is an independent newspaper reported since its establishment in 2007 on corruption in Oman (an absolute monarchy) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016.</seg>

<seg id="2563">"on 26 September 2016, the first trial in the trial against Al-Maamari, Al-Haj and Al-Abri took place before the court in Maskat."</seg>
<seg id="2564">The court sentenced the three journalists to jail and also ordered the final closing of the newspaper.</seg>

<seg id="2566">"in addition, Al-Haj was found guilty of the violation of a prohibition of publication and defamation."</seg>
<seg id="2567">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fines in the amount of $3000 ($7800).</seg>
<seg id="2568">Al-Abri was sentenced to a year of imprisonment and a fine of 1000 Rial (2600 US dollars) after he found the use of "an information network for the distribution of material which could pose a threat to public order."</seg>
<seg id="2569">"for Al Abri, a security deposit was set in the amount of $5000 ($13000) and was released from prison on 22 August 2016."</seg>

<seg id="2573">"despite the decision of the court to allow Azamn to return, the newspaper continues to be exposed to attacks by the government of India."</seg>
<seg id="2574">"on 8 January, the Minister of Information issued an order with which the closure of" Azamn "was extended by three months."</seg>
<seg id="2575">"on 8 May 2017, the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closure of" Azamn "was extended by three additional months, with which the Minister once again opposed the decision of the Court of Appeal to re-publish the publication of the newspaper."</seg>
<seg id="2576">The continuing closure of Azamn and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which in Oman in recent times the freedom of the press was violated.</seg>
<seg id="2577">"further injuries include, for example, the closure of the website of the independent journal Mowatin and the exercise of pressure on Albalad, the first independent online newspaper in the country to cease its operation."</seg>

<seg id="2587">"Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, mapping takes place with his consent"</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media. this is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on site: on the one hand there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">"diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have much more serious effects in Africa's poorest countries than elsewhere, and lack of investment to research these diseases by drug companies is a major problem."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"secondly, research carried out by African scientists helps build own research capacities in Africa. a major role in science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent."</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Central Laboratory at the Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">"he grew up in Lusaka, Zambia in the 1990s, especially when the AIDS epidemic showed the first serious impact on national health."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"he left Zambia for studying in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"as a post-doc at the University of Pennsylvania, he conducted research on the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the Serbian healthcare system."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"with Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about the misunderstanding of the media about this research."</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">"Ranjit Warrier: right now, the focus of my work is on the application of research results. in doing so, I support the Serbian national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests."</seg>
<seg id="2600">"in addition, I have just started a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens."</seg>
<seg id="2601">GM: what do you think are the most important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only implement solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">"this has to change, otherwise we will always remain beneficiaries instead of being creators themselves."</seg>
<seg id="2605">"the solutions we get are often not well used in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here."</seg>

<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>

<seg id="2613">What are the obstacles in your routine research work you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">"RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money, a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet."</seg>

<seg id="2616">GM: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">"RW: there is already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods."</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">"GM: how big is your opinion according to the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it focus on, and how can we support the development?"</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">"there is a need for special academic education, starting at any age."</seg>
<seg id="2623">"social sciences, computer sciences, big data, research into space, health care (non-transferable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly."</seg>
<seg id="2624">"GM: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa, based on your experience?"</seg>
<seg id="2625">"RW: often, it is the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here."</seg>

<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "open source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">"this article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine reported on solutions for environmental problems worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding salad for the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outreddis, the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA astronauts in space."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for almost 20 years, Morton's work has been limited only by his own resourcefulness and the question of how many types of lettuce he can get."</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he couldn't use them further for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">"patents do not only apply to single varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green tone or crimped leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"over the past few years, more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cereals or carrots. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representative of a millennia of old tradition, Morton keeps growing lettuce, but he now needs longer, since his work is becoming more and more complicated by ever increasing restrictions."</seg>
<seg id="2636">"it is like lying in a river a boulder, around which I have to ride down."</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do that now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition," he says. "I think that these patents go too far on salads."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they stand before the court, no one can breed a new type of salad, because all the characteristics are already patented."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, it is very careful and endeavours to not use any material protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement growing more and more in the United States and around the world: open Source Breeding (Open Source Breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Roman lettuce of the variety Outredym in the "greenhouse" of the station. there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">"it is no coincidence that this name sounds like that, as if the movement from the IT area comes from and not from the field of plant breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2644">"the Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for open source seed) is inspired by the movement for free" open source "software, which provides alternatives to copyrighted software."</seg>
<seg id="2645">It has been created to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and are thus permanently usable for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">"within the framework of the initiative, called Ossi briefly, US breeders can commit to the use of other bred seeds."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"however, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it." open source "breeders allow only others who buy their seed, breed it to breed their own varieties, and do not immediately sow - two aspects that are forbidden or prescribed by many plant patents."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">"Jack Kloppenburg, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi, is in control of the seed and the ability to breed new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"according to them, seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try not to use the latter or only little by breeding seed with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasizes that the "open-source" movement does not concern genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all types of plants could be patented whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from organic farming or not." in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control of the seed, "he says, taking into account the increasingly common mergers in the global agricultural industry, as it is, for example, on farmers markets."</seg>
<seg id="2654">Food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">"members of the Open Source Seed Initiative agree to keep their seed available free of charge, as opposed to patent seed and plant characteristics."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi supporters argue that the future of food provision is at risk, as the available gene pool is constantly shrinking due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material which is therefore always available."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, director director of Ossi, has worked in her PhD thesis on genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about one third of all vets were protected as intellectual property, making it difficult for plant breeders either not or only difficult to use."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"there are not yet such estimates for other plants, but experts such as Luby suspect that masked crops such as wheat are patented in an even greater style than salad or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants are bred in such a way that they have specific desirable traits - from those by which their taste or colour improves to such, due to which they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders declines by more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much worse than ever due to climate change."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail, Monsanto spokesperson Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four genbanks and cooperation with institutions such as the United States Department of Agriculture, the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it contradicts the notion that intellectual property belongs to other breeders, as" "patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation." "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expired."</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"such protection does not inhibit innovation, but encourages them by providing more material and know-how to the public."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton sees that differently: 20 years to wait, until a patent expires, certainly does not promote innovations."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"if you have to wait so long for breeding of plants adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you would have lost the fight."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"however, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and continue to remain:" independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what drives us, and it is impossible for us to continue to use the best and newest genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"in total, Morton interferes with the concept of patented plant features:" we don't really create the characteristics themselves. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them themselves and as breeders we have no idea how the plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the U.S. state Oregon and Ossi Executive Board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding:" whoever breeds a variety breeds also its own values into it. "</seg>
<seg id="2676">"those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, are needed for their cultivation of mass herbicides, bred in its varieties this concept of agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is exact opposite. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized companies (such firms move on international markets, but smaller than Z. B. Monsanto), they manage most of the smaller seed companies, even without patents to survive - either they reject the patent or they consider it too expensive and therefore not rewarding, or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton is looking for Salate in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"Morton also believes that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents:" it looks like I am working with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than a company that patented. "</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I constantly need new material for my catalogue because I know that my competitors are selling my varieties for themselves in a few years," he says. "with a patent, one is protected from competition for 20 years."</seg>
<seg id="2683">"although the US seems to be a leader in" open source "breeding, the concept is now spreading rapidly throughout the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (Centre for Sustainable Agriculture), which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources, is working together with farmers and helps them grow new varieties that meet certain requirements."</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "open source" seeds and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German Association Agreements is working on an open source license, which is ultimately a more formal and legally binding form of Ossi's commitment to breeders in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"(regulations for breeding differ from country to country, hence the Ossi obligation cannot be easily adopted one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)"</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventional bred plants should not be patentable."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, an explanation is not yet a law; now it is at the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference on" open source "seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers, operators of seed banks and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn about the" open source "seed movement and the worldwide trend towards seed patenting."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos's programme for" open source "seed systems, explains that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for" open source "seed systems, which is scheduled to drop the official launch next year."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"an association of environmental and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international nonprofit development aid organisation USC Canada and the action group on erosion, technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database of seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"in September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food - has published a report that farmers have the opportunity to come to seed, exchange and improve seed policy so that a stable supply of food can be ensured."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"the report also highlights the importance of a diverse, local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection between the Luby von Ossi hopes that more people will soon be recognized."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological food has, above all, taken care of where and how something is cultivated, and seed systems have hardly played a role here," Luby says. "we are now trying to make people clear that even more is behind their food."</seg>

<seg id="2734">"in a Facebook comment, Ziada expressed himself by the government and reflected what this means for him:"</seg>
<seg id="2735">"blocking the blogs is very old, but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be meaningful for the world, it is for me for two reasons:"</seg>
<seg id="2736">"I have succeeded in giving me the feeling of a state of siege. an arrest, a murder, summons to the National Security Council, the lock blog and any other website for which I was working."</seg>
<seg id="2737">"2) You have proven that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words have influence, even if only on a small audience."</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to post items to circumvent censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">"but now that they have locked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave go the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">"according to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte), Egyptian authorities locked up 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August 133. this resulted in technical tests in networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP) including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat."</seg>
<seg id="2743">"also documented the blocking of providers, through the relocation of boarding facilities and private surfing possible, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)"</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">"on Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of websites that VPNs are offering began."</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice indicates the government's intention to continue to block and filter content that Egyptian users could have access.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"in addition, the situation is exacerbated by the fact that the decision-making decisions are taken behind closed doors, which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis with which it can proceed against these actions in court."</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and who will attack it next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants argue.</seg>

<seg id="2753">"day after day newspapers in Brazil report with dark headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motives."</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old in school," "Every second day a police officer is murdered in Rio de Janeiro", "" "Thieves robbed the drugstore with military weapons," "President Timer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, navy and airwaves to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">"in the midst of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the power wave 2017 in Rio has reached the highest level for 10 years."</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organisation Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least find the manager of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"on 16 August, the" Extra "newspaper, known for its detailed coverage of violence in Rio, published the editorial," This is not normal, "in which she announced a new section called" War in Rio. ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in the city are now published.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The paper thus explained the motives for their decision:</seg>
<seg id="2762">"it will continue to report on crimes committed in every major city in the world such as murder, robbery, sex crime, etc. all that happens from civilized standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the rubric" war in Rio. "(...) This is our way of calling: this is not normal!"</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative so that as journalists we don't close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">"in a four-minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper, said that this decision is no reason for pride but rather a sign of failure:"</seg>
<seg id="2765">It is probably the only newspaper on the whole world with a rubric in a country that does not recognize the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">"in the same video, a journalist of the newspaper declares that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro, there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organisations."</seg>
<seg id="2767">"in the editorial, the newspaper writes on:"</seg>
<seg id="2768">"we are aware that a war discourse, if it is distorted, can also be used to disguise cruelty of the police that shoots and then asks questions."</seg>
<seg id="2769">"but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose aim is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners."</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm more than it benefits?</seg>
<seg id="2771">"in an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist Cecília Oliveira argue against the violence as" "war". "this is, in her opinion, a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to hold responsible persons in the police."</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">"this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as shown in the analysis of the military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, education and a historical and self-complying neglect of public service."</seg>
<seg id="2774">"as a reminder, the state of Rio de Janeiro is larger than its capital."</seg>

<seg id="2778">None of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">"looking at the murders per federal state, Rio is in place 16," she writes. "</seg>
<seg id="2780">"the company Globo, the largest media company in South America, which, as Cecília stresses, has been repeating the state's security policy for years."</seg>
<seg id="2781">"this security policy also included the creation of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), a police unit established by the state of Rio in 2003, whose aim is to conquer a favela by using a massive police custody and to permanently stationed a unit there."</seg>
<seg id="2782">"in the beginning, this actually led to a decrease of forcible death cases. however, for several years, the UPP has been increasingly under fire after several reports of harassment and repressions against the poor communities that should actually protect the newly created police unit."</seg>
<seg id="2783">"on his Facebook page, the journalist João Paulo Charleaux quoted from one of his articles from the year 2010, in which he explains why violence in Rio does not conform to the criteria defined by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term" civil war. ""</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">"in addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also has serious consequences for the people."</seg>
<seg id="2786">"this includes penetration into the territory of a" enemy, "in which a civilian is a sharp point in the countryside and becomes an object for" collateral damage "and" lost bullets. ""</seg>
<seg id="2787">"war back or forth, fact is that the inhabitants of the favelas continue to suffer in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2788">"one week ago, the police cleared the mountain with the favela Jacarezinho to avenge the death of a policeman."</seg>

<seg id="2802">"since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades, mainly due to the Assad regime against loyal troops."</seg>
<seg id="2803">"according to Worldwatch, a joint initiative of the Peace organization PAX and the research institute The Syria Institute, there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and Umland, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib."</seg>
<seg id="2804">"the East Ghouta region is particularly affected, where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 demanded hundreds of civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2805">"many governments, international organizations and the Syrian opposition are based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was perpetrated by the Assad regime."</seg>
<seg id="2806">"since 2013, these rebel-controlled areas have been under siege from Damascus, which led to the need for smuggling food on locally produced or through tunnels and control points."</seg>
<seg id="2807">"due to the years of blockade, traditional foods such as meat have become unattainable for large parts of the population."</seg>
<seg id="2808">"as a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and academics teaches the inhabitants of East Ghoutas, how they can plant their own fungi as a" life-saving food source. ""</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnida and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">"mushrooms do not belong to the traditional food planted in Syria, and are very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their nutritional value makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieged east Ghouta."</seg>
<seg id="2811">"the Direkt of the project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:"</seg>
<seg id="2812">"we chose to cultivate fungi because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because it is possible to plant them in houses and cellars."</seg>
<seg id="2813">"Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organizers, reports Global Voices, which has been fighting for three years to make this project known and expressed its relief that it now gains more and more prominence."</seg>
<seg id="2814">"in order to collect money for the initiative, we use the humanitarian crowdfunding platform CanDo in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alnida."</seg>
<seg id="2815">"it is planned to provide 125 families with knowledge of planting mushrooms, according to Dr. Leila to Global Voices."</seg>
<seg id="2816">"at the time of the constitution of this article, they have achieved over 100% of their expected target of around 12,700 €, but will continue to collect donations to CanDo until Monday, September 4th 2017."</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative relies on generators that keep temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">"because of the shortage of fuel, locally produced plastics are used in plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy."</seg>
<seg id="2819">Dr. Leila said Global Voices that they began with the "production of fungal seeds originating from the regions" before checking their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption.</seg>
<seg id="2820">"then they planted a small mushroom courtyard in a tub. when this succeeded, they used a bigger bowl. and so on."</seg>
<seg id="2821">"now they have designed a" "educational farm for the region". ""</seg>
<seg id="2822">Since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months they have spread mushrooms throughout East Ghouta free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Dr. Leila explained that it is part of a larger movement.</seg>
<seg id="2824">"" "we want to teach the people mushroom breeding for various reasons" ": break of the siege."</seg>

<seg id="2832">Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the 2017 fires</seg>
<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested on 21 October in many districts in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were raging in the north of Portugal in the week before.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and about 70 were injured following the fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the fact that the government proclaimed the last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also registered in Galicia region in Spain where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">"it is estimated that there have been more than 500 fire outbreaks, spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages."</seg>
<seg id="2837">"in June, Pedrógão Grande acquired a similar tragedy, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured."</seg>
<seg id="2838">"according to the European forest surveillance system, which monitors forest areas by satellite photographs alone in 2017 in Portugal approximately 500,000 hectares of forest are burned - an area of the size of the Lisbon district."</seg>
<seg id="2839">"so that you can make a better picture of the seriousness of the situation, there is no fire in only 4 districts."</seg>
<seg id="2840">"the whole of Portugal burns in the truest sense of the word # PrayFormer - nata, (@ a _ ataner) October 15th, 2017"</seg>

<seg id="2844">The foreseeable tragedy</seg>
<seg id="2845">The aim of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state.</seg>
<seg id="2846">People wondered why civil protection was not able to contain the extent of the tragedy as far as possible</seg>
<seg id="2847">João Soveral of the Confederation of Farmers of Portugal declared the newspaper Público:</seg>
<seg id="2848">"after Pedrógão, roads and villages were evacuated for everything and nothing."</seg>
<seg id="2849">This Sunday they did not do this anywhere: there are dozens of reports from open roads enclosed by fire.</seg>
<seg id="2850">"in the woods of Leiria, a similar tragedy would have happened as in June, as the roads were locked very late."</seg>
<seg id="2851">"in addition, construction permits in locations with high fire risk are questioned."</seg>
<seg id="2852">"a wide-reaching proposal for the forest reform, introduced by the government for serious fires in 2003 and 2005, was objected by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment."</seg>
<seg id="2853">"the government introduced a slackening of the law which allowed the construction activity from case to case, if the applicant had a means of self-defence - that was an open backdoor, so that everything could be built," João Sorrow continues in the same article of the newspaper Público. "</seg>
<seg id="2854">"the environmental organisation Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus trees, trees made of easily combustible wood, spread like in a vicious circle, after fires of this kind."</seg>
<seg id="2855">"these problems add that the website of civil protection from Portugal on 15 and 16 October, when people were looking for information or attempted to contact relatives offline."</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided the population with information: they used the own civil protection data using the application fogos.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">"the project was founded in 2015 by the developer João Pina in order to simplify the work of the fire brigade and was so crucial in this fateful weekend in October that the servers were not able to withstand the onslaught of the 400,000 users that followed the fires."</seg>

<seg id="2874">"two years earlier, a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mujahedin groups that had defeated the short-lived pro-Soviet government. thus Afghanistan had become a country of terror and despair."</seg>
<seg id="2875">"at this time Asharaf Barati, a 13-year-old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Hazara, was in the Ghazni Province in Central Africa for the last time together with his family at dinner."</seg>
<seg id="2876">"even though his mother did not say so at that time, she knew that she would no longer see her son - perhaps even more."</seg>

<seg id="2884">"Abdul Ali Mazari, leader of Hezb-e-Wahdat, dominated by Hazara, had just been murdered by the Taliban, and many Hazara suddenly felt safe."</seg>
<seg id="2885">"the Taliban, known for their hatred of the Hazara, always came closer."</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">"a few days after his flight, Asharaf found himself in Pakistan."</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coal mine. the work was heavy and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">"then he took what was left of his low wages, and went to Iran. once again he found himself in a foreign country together with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortars that were heavier than he himself, in order to earn his livelihood."</seg>
<seg id="2890">"back then, like today, Afghan refugees in Iran have been characterised by poverty and exploitation."</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," "said Asharaf in an interview with Global Voices." "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site where we also worked."</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services and no heating. we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we did not freeze at night.</seg>
<seg id="2893">"after four years, Ashark left his life without papers in Iran and made himself ready for the journey to Europe."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"during the dangerous crossing on the sea, he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island."</seg>
<seg id="2895">"after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application, Ashark came to Italy in 2002."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"some time Asharaf was homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, fell asleep in parks, and went to a church who distributed food to the needy twice a day."</seg>
<seg id="2897">"although it is true that due to relatively high twin rates, Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers. it is true, however, that the conditions that asylum seekers are in the country are catastrophic."</seg>
<seg id="2898">The Civil Liberties Union for Europe human rights organisation writes that the system "suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">The large majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in the more than 3000 "special reception centres." these are improvised institutions in the hands of unqualified and unimaginable personnel.</seg>
<seg id="2900">"according to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be admitted to a reception centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - which can be applied for months after the registration of the asylum application."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"until then, people who don't have money for accommodation can either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street."</seg>
<seg id="2902">So there was also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">"but Asharaf, however, helped to free himself from these conditions."</seg>
<seg id="2904">"after several years of working in the construction industry, Asharaf was putting his entire savings into the establishment of a hostels in Venice."</seg>
<seg id="2905">This was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a quick snack.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis success story is now the theme of the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") by director Amin Wahidi.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">"much bureaucracy, high taxes, and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles."</seg>
<seg id="2913">"according to inofficial estimates, some 20,000 Afghans live in Italy."</seg>
<seg id="2914">"for many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries."</seg>
<seg id="2915">"in recent years some of Afghans have arisen, including tailors, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"in Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience, where the waiters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">"the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy by the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek dishes."</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">"Ashara's goals, however, extend far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retail, and aim to return to the country which he forced to leave as a teenager."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"where there is a risk, there are also possibilities," says Asharaf with a smile. "I want to invest in Afghanistan."</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I can't live happily when I know my people are suffering.</seg>
<seg id="2923">"I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women."</seg>
<seg id="2924">They represent half of society and have to get the same possibilities as everyone else.</seg>
<seg id="2925">"Asharaf also forges plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul, where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques." so they can sell their crop surpluses in the market and improve their financial situation, "he says."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"the development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but in the end there are stability and prosperity."</seg>
