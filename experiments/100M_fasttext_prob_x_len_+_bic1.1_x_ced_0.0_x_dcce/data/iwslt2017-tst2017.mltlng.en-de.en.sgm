<seg id="1">So this is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You may know him as the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter for The New York Times.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before anybody knew Edward Snowden's name, Risen wrote a book in which he famously exposed that the NSA was illegally wiretapping the phone calls of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it's another chapter in that book that may have an even more lasting impact.</seg>
<seg id="5">In it, he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation in which the CIA quite literally handed over blueprints of a nuclear bomb to Iran.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, go read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It's an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But you know who didn't like that chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For nearly a decade afterwards, Risen was the subject of a US government investigation in which prosecutors demanded that he testify against one of his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">And along the way, he became the face for the US government's recent pattern of prosecuting whistleblowers and spying on journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">You see, under the First Amendment, the press has the right to publish secret information in the public interest.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it's impossible to exercise that right if the media can't also gather that news and protect the identities of the brave men and women who get it to them.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government came knocking, Risen did what many brave reporters have done before him: he refused and said he'd rather go to jail.</seg>
<seg id="15">So from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived under the specter of going to federal prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">That is, until just days before the trial, when a curious thing happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, after years of claiming it was vital to their case, the government dropped their demands to Risen altogether.</seg>
<seg id="18">It turns out, in the age of electronic surveillance, there are very few places reporters and sources can hide.</seg>
<seg id="19">And instead of trying and failing to have Risen testify, they could have his digital trail testify against him instead.</seg>
<seg id="20">So completely in secret and without his consent, prosecutors got Risen's phone records.</seg>
<seg id="21">They got his email records, his financial and banking information, his credit reports, even travel records with a list of flights he had taken.</seg>
<seg id="22">And it was among this information that they used to convict Jeffrey Sterling, Risen's alleged source and CIA whistleblower.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sadly, this is only one case of many.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama ran on a promise to protect whistleblowers, and instead, his Justice Department has prosecuted more than all other administrations combined.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now, you can see how this could be a problem, especially because the government considers so much of what it does secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since 9/11, virtually every important story about national security has been the result of a whistleblower coming to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So we risk seeing the press unable to do their job that the First Amendment is supposed to protect because of the government's expanded ability to spy on everyone.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as technology has allowed the government to circumvent reporters' rights, the press can also use technology to protect their sources even better than before.</seg>
<seg id="29">And they can start from the moment they begin speaking with them, rather than on the witness stand after the fact.</seg>
<seg id="30">Communications software now exists that wasn't available when Risen was writing his book, and is much more surveillance-resistant than regular emails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">For example, one such tool is SecureDrop, an open-source whistleblower submission system that was originally created by the late Internet luminary Aaron Swartz, and is now developed at the non-profit where I work, Freedom of the Press Foundation.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an email, you go to a news organization's website, like this one here on The Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">From there, you can upload a document or send information much like you would on any other contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">It'll then be encrypted and stored on a server that only the news organization has access to.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government can no longer secretly demand the information, and much of the information they would demand wouldn't be available in the first place.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop, though, is really only a small part of the puzzle for protecting press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments all over the world are constantly developing new spying techniques that put us all at risk.</seg>
<seg id="38">And it's up to us going forward to make sure that it's not just the tech-savvy whistleblowers, like Edward Snowden, who have an avenue for exposing wrongdoing.</seg>
<seg id="39">It's just as vital that we protect the next veteran's health care whistleblower alerting us to overcrowded hospitals, or the next environmental worker sounding the alarm about Flint's dirty water, or a Wall Street insider warning us of the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these tools weren't just built to help the brave men and women who expose crimes, but are meant to protect all of our rights under the Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[On April 3, 2016 we saw the largest data leak in history.] [The Panama Papers exposed rich and powerful people] [hiding vast amounts of money in offshore accounts.] [What does this mean?] [We called Robert Palmer of Global Witness to explain.] This week, there have been a whole slew and deluge of stories coming out from the leak of 11 million documents from a Panamanian-based law firm called Mossack Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The release of these papers from Panama lifts the veil on a tiny piece of the secretive offshore world.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an insight into how clients and banks and lawyers go to companies like Mossack Fonseca and say, "OK, we want an anonymous company, can you give us one?"</seg>
<seg id="45">So you actually get to see the emails, you get to see the exchanges of messages, you get to see the mechanics of how this works, how this operates.</seg>
<seg id="46">Now, this has already started to have pretty immediate repercussions.</seg>
<seg id="47">The Prime Minister of Iceland has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">We've also had news that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar Al-Assad has also got offshore companies.</seg>
<seg id="49">There's been allegations of a $2 billion money trail that leads back to President Vladimir Putin of Russia via his close childhood friend, who happens to be a top cellist.</seg>
<seg id="50">And there will be a lot of rich individuals out there and others who will be nervous about the next set of stories and the next set of leaked documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now, this sounds like the plot of a spy thriller or a John Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems very distant from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we care about this?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is that if rich and powerful individuals are able to keep their money offshore and not pay the taxes that they should, it means that there is less money for vital public services like healthcare, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">Now, for my organization Global Witness, this exposé has been phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">We have the world's media and political leaders talking about how individuals can use offshore secrecy to hide and disguise their assets -- something we have been talking about and exposing for a decade.</seg>
<seg id="58">Now, I think a lot of people find this entire world baffling and confusing, and hard to understand how this sort of offshore world works.</seg>
<seg id="59">I like to think of it a bit like a Russian doll.</seg>
<seg id="60">So you can have one company stacked inside another company, stacked inside another company, making it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for law enforcement or tax authorities, journalists, civil society to really understand what's going on.</seg>
<seg id="62">I also think it's interesting that there's been less coverage of this issue in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="63">And that's perhaps because some prominent US people just haven't figured in this exposé, in this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now, that's not because there are no rich Americans who are stashing their assets offshore.</seg>
<seg id="65">It's just because of the way in which offshore works, Mossack Fonseca has fewer American clients.</seg>
<seg id="66">I think if we saw leaks from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware or Wyoming or Nevada, you would see many more cases and examples linking back to Americans.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, in a number of US states you need less information, you need to provide less information to get a company than you do to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">That sort of secrecy in America has allowed employees of school districts to rip off schoolchildren.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed scammers to rip off vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">This is the sort of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Now, at Global Witness, we wanted to see what this actually looked like in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does this actually work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So what we did is we sent in an undercover investigator to 13 Manhattan law firms.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator posed as an African minister who wanted to move suspect funds into the United States to buy a house, a yacht, a jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">Now, what was truly shocking was that all but one of those lawyers provided our investigator with suggestions on how to move those suspect funds.</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all preliminary meetings, and none of the lawyers took us on as a client and of course no money moved hands, but it really shows the problem with the system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It's also important to not just think about this as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">This is not just about an individual lawyer who's spoken to our undercover investigator and provided suggestions.</seg>
<seg id="79">It's not just about a particular senior politician who's been caught up in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">This is about how a system works, that entrenches corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And in order to tackle this, we need to change the game.</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules of the game to make this sort of behavior harder.</seg>
<seg id="83">This may seem like doom and gloom, like there's nothing we can do about it, like nothing has ever changed, like there will always be rich and powerful individuals.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a natural optimist, I do see that we are starting to get some change.</seg>
<seg id="85">Over the last couple of years, we've seen a real push towards greater transparency when it comes to company ownership.</seg>
<seg id="86">This issue was put on the political agenda by the UK Prime Minister David Cameron at a big G8 Summit that was held in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">And since then, the European Union is going to be creating central registers at a national level of who really owns and controls companies across Europe.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the things that is sad is that, actually, the US is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">There's bipartisan legislation that had been introduced in the House and the Senate, but it isn't making as much progress as we'd like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">So we'd really want to see the Panama leaks, this huge peek into the offshore world, be used as a way of opening up in the US and around the world.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness, this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people to get angry at the way in which people can hide their identity behind secret companies.</seg>
<seg id="93">We need business leaders to stand up and say, "Secrecy like this is not good for business."</seg>
<seg id="94">We need political leaders to recognize the problem, and to commit to changing the law to open up this sort of secrecy.</seg>
<seg id="95">Together, we can end the secrecy that is currently allowing tax evasion, corruption, money laundering to flourish.</seg>
<seg id="96">I want to tell you the story about the time I almost got kidnapped in the trunk of a red Mazda Miata.</seg>
<seg id="97">It's the day after graduating from design school and I'm having a yard sale.</seg>
<seg id="98">And this guy pulls up in this red Mazda and he starts looking through my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">And he buys a piece of art that I made.</seg>
<seg id="100">And it turns out he's alone in town for the night, driving cross-country on a road trip before he goes into the Peace Corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">So I invite him out for a beer and he tells me all about his passion for making a difference in the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">Now it's starting to get late, and I'm getting pretty tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">As I motion for the tab, I make the mistake of asking him, "So where are you staying tonight?"</seg>
<seg id="104">And he makes it worse by saying, "Actually, I don't have a place."</seg>
<seg id="105">And I'm thinking, "Oh, man!"</seg>
<seg id="106">What do you do?</seg>
<seg id="107">We've all been there, right?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I offer to host this guy?</seg>
<seg id="109">But, I just met him -- I mean, he says he's going to the Peace Corps, but I don't really know if he's going to the Peace Corps and I don't want to end up kidnapped in the trunk of a Miata.</seg>
<seg id="110">That's a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">So then I hear myself saying, "Hey, I have an airbed you can stay on in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">And the voice in my head goes, "Wait, what?"</seg>
<seg id="113">That night, I'm laying in bed, I'm staring at the ceiling and thinking, "Oh my god, what have I done?</seg>
<seg id="114">There's a complete stranger sleeping in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he's psychotic?"</seg>
<seg id="116">My anxiety grows so much, I leap out of bed, I sneak on my tiptoes to the door, and I lock the bedroom door.</seg>
<seg id="117">It turns out he was not psychotic.</seg>
<seg id="118">We've kept in touch ever since.</seg>
<seg id="119">And the piece of art he bought at the yard sale is hanging in his classroom; he's a teacher now.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first hosting experience, and it completely changed my perspective.</seg>
<seg id="121">Maybe the people that my childhood taught me to label as strangers were actually friends waiting to be discovered.</seg>
<seg id="122">The idea of hosting people on airbeds gradually became natural to me and when I moved to San Francisco, I brought the airbed with me.</seg>
<seg id="123">So now it's two years later.</seg>
<seg id="124">I'm unemployed, I'm almost broke, my roommate moves out, and then the rent goes up.</seg>
<seg id="125">And then I learn there's a design conference coming to town, and all the hotels are sold out.</seg>
<seg id="126">And I've always believed that turning fear into fun is the gift of creativity.</seg>
<seg id="127">So here's what I pitch my best friend and my new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, thought of a way to make a few bucks -- turning our place into 'designers bed and breakfast,' offering young designers who come to town a place to crash, complete with wireless Internet, a small desk space, sleeping mat, and breakfast each morning.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha!"</seg>
<seg id="129">We built a basic website and Airbed and Breakfast was born.</seg>
<seg id="130">Three lucky guests got to stay on a 20-dollar airbed on the hardwood floor.</seg>
<seg id="131">But they loved it, and so did we.</seg>
<seg id="132">I swear, the ham and Swiss cheese omelets we made tasted totally different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We took them on adventures around the city, and when we said goodbye to the last guest, the door latch clicked, Brian and I just stared at each other.</seg>
<seg id="134">Did we just discover it was possible to make friends while also making rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">The wheels had started to turn.</seg>
<seg id="136">My old roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined as engineering co-founder.</seg>
<seg id="137">And we buckled down to see if we could turn this into a business.</seg>
<seg id="138">Here's what we pitched investors: "We want to build a website where people publicly post pictures of their most intimate spaces, their bedrooms, the bathrooms -- the kinds of rooms you usually keep closed when people come over.</seg>
<seg id="139">And then, over the Internet, they're going to invite complete strangers to come sleep in their homes.</seg>
<seg id="140">It's going to be huge!"</seg>
<seg id="141">We sat back, and we waited for the rocket ship to blast off.</seg>
<seg id="142">It did not.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one in their right minds would invest in a service that allows strangers to sleep in people's homes.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we've all been taught as kids, strangers equal danger.</seg>
<seg id="146">Now, when you're faced with a problem, you fall back on what you know, and all we really knew was design.</seg>
<seg id="147">In art school, you learn that design is much more than the look and feel of something -- it's the whole experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We learned to do that for objects, but here, we were aiming to build Olympic trust between people who had never met.</seg>
<seg id="149">Could design make that happen?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to design for trust?</seg>
<seg id="151">I want to give you a sense of the flavor of trust that we were aiming to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="152">I've got a 30-second experiment that will push you past your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">If you're up for it, give me a thumbs-up.</seg>
<seg id="154">OK, I need you to take out your phones.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now that you have your phone out, I'd like you to unlock your phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now hand your unlocked phone to the person on your left.</seg>
<seg id="157">That tiny sense of panic you're feeling right now -- is exactly how hosts feel the first time they open their home.</seg>
<seg id="158">Because the only thing more personal than your phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">People don't just see your messages, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">Now, how does it feel holding someone's unlocked phone?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most of us feel really responsible.</seg>
<seg id="162">That's how most guests feel when they stay in a home.</seg>
<seg id="163">And it's because of this that our company can even exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">By the way, who's holding Al Gore's phone?</seg>
<seg id="165">Would you tell Twitter he's running for President?</seg>
<seg id="166">OK, you can hand your phones back now.</seg>
<seg id="167">So now that you've experienced the kind of trust challenge we were facing, I'd love to share a few discoveries we've made along the way.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we changed one small thing about the design of that experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor had introduced themselves first, with their name, where they're from, the name of their kids or their dog?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine that they had 150 reviews of people saying, "They're great at holding unlocked phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">Now how would you feel about handing your phone over?</seg>
<seg id="172">a well-designed reputation system is key for building trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">And we didn't actually get it right the first time.</seg>
<seg id="174">It's hard for people to leave bad reviews.</seg>
<seg id="175">Eventually, we learned to wait until both guests and hosts left the review before we reveal them.</seg>
<seg id="176">Now, here's a discovery we made just last week.</seg>
<seg id="177">We did a joint study with Stanford, where we looked at people's willingness to trust someone based on how similar they are in age, location and geography.</seg>
<seg id="178">The research showed, not surprisingly, we prefer people who are like us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more different somebody is, the less we trust them.</seg>
<seg id="180">Now, that's a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">But what's interesting is what happens when you add reputation into the mix, in this case, with reviews.</seg>
<seg id="182">Now, if you've got less than three reviews, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you've got more than 10, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">High reputation beats high similarity.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can actually help us overcome one of our most deeply rooted biases.</seg>
<seg id="186">Now we also learned that building the right amount of trust takes the right amount of disclosure.</seg>
<seg id="187">This is what happens when a guest first messages a host.</seg>
<seg id="188">If you share too little, like, "Yo," acceptance rates go down.</seg>
<seg id="189">And if you share too much, like, "I'm having issues with my mother," acceptance rates also go down.</seg>
<seg id="190">But there's a zone that's just right, like, "Love the artwork in your place. Coming for vacation with my family."</seg>
<seg id="191">So how do we design for just the right amount of disclosure?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the box to suggest the right length, and we guide them with prompts to encourage sharing.</seg>
<seg id="193">We bet our whole company on the hope that, with the right design, people would be willing to overcome the stranger-danger bias.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we didn't realize is just how many people were ready and waiting to put the bias aside.</seg>
<seg id="195">This is a graph that shows our rate of adoption.</seg>
<seg id="196">There's three things happening here.</seg>
<seg id="197">The first, an unbelievable amount of luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">The second is the efforts of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">And third is the existence of a previously unsatisfied need.</seg>
<seg id="200">Now, things have been going pretty well.</seg>
<seg id="201">Obviously, there are times when things don't work out.</seg>
<seg id="202">Guests have thrown unauthorized parties and trashed homes.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have left guests stranded in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">In the early days, I was customer service, and those calls came right to my cell phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I was at the front lines of trust breaking.</seg>
<seg id="206">And there's nothing worse than those calls, it hurts to even think about them.</seg>
<seg id="207">And the disappointment in the sound of someone's voice was and, I would say, still is our single greatest motivator to keep improving.</seg>
<seg id="208">Thankfully, out of the 123 million nights we've ever hosted, less than a fraction of a percent have been problematic.</seg>
<seg id="209">Turns out, people are justified in their trust.</seg>
<seg id="210">And when trust works out right, it can be absolutely magical.</seg>
<seg id="211">We had a guest stay with a host in Uruguay, and he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">The host rushed him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">They donated their own blood for his operation.</seg>
<seg id="214">Let me read you his review.</seg>
<seg id="215">"Excellent house for sedentary travelers prone to myocardial infarctions.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and has direct access to the best hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra instantly become guardian angels who will save your life without even knowing you.</seg>
<seg id="218">They will rush you to the hospital in their own car while you're dying and stay in the waiting room while the doctors give you a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">They don't want you to feel lonely, they bring you books to read.</seg>
<seg id="220">And they let you stay at their house extra nights without charging you.</seg>
<seg id="221">Highly recommended!"</seg>
<seg id="222">Of course, not every stay is like that.</seg>
<seg id="223">But this connection beyond the transaction is exactly what the sharing economy is aiming for.</seg>
<seg id="224">Now, when I heard that term, I have to admit, it tripped me up.</seg>
<seg id="225">How do sharing and transactions go together?</seg>
<seg id="226">So let's be clear; it is about commerce.</seg>
<seg id="227">But if you just called it the rental economy, it would be incomplete.</seg>
<seg id="228">The sharing economy is commerce with the promise of human connection.</seg>
<seg id="229">People share a part of themselves, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">You know how most travel today is, like, I think of it like fast food -- it's efficient and consistent, at the cost of local and authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What if travel were like a magnificent buffet of local experiences?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if anywhere you visited, there was a central marketplace of locals offering to get you thoroughly drunk on a pub crawl in neighborhoods you didn't even know existed.</seg>
<seg id="233">Or learning to cook from the chef of a five-star restaurant?</seg>
<seg id="234">Today, homes are designed around the idea of privacy and separation.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if homes were designed to be shared from the ground up?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities embraced a culture of sharing?</seg>
<seg id="238">I see a future of shared cities that bring us community and connection instead of isolation and separation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea, in the city of Seoul, they've actually even started this.</seg>
<seg id="240">They've repurposed hundreds of government parking spots to be shared by residents.</seg>
<seg id="241">They're connecting students who need a place to live with empty-nesters who have extra rooms.</seg>
<seg id="242">And they've started an incubator to help fund the next generation Tonight, just on our service, 785,000 people in 191 countries will either stay in a stranger's home or welcome one into theirs.</seg>
<seg id="243">Clearly, it's not as crazy as we were taught.</seg>
<seg id="244">We didn't invent anything new.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality has been around forever.</seg>
<seg id="246">There's been many other websites like ours.</seg>
<seg id="247">So, why did ours eventually take off?</seg>
<seg id="248">Luck and timing aside, I've learned that you can take the components of trust, and you can design for that.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can overcome our most deeply rooted stranger-danger bias.</seg>
<seg id="250">And that's amazing to me.</seg>
<seg id="251">It blows my mind.</seg>
<seg id="252">I think about this every time I see a red Miata go by.</seg>
<seg id="253">Now, we know design won't solve all the world's problems.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it can help out with this one, if it can make a dent in this, it makes me wonder, what else can we design for next?</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A woman of faith? An expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or oppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist.</seg>
<seg id="260">Or just an airport security line delay.</seg>
<seg id="261">That one's actually true.</seg>
<seg id="262">If some of your perceptions were negative, I don't really blame you.</seg>
<seg id="263">That's just how the media has been portraying people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">One study found that 80 percent of news coverage about Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">And studies show that Americans say that most don't know a Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="266">I guess people don't talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">Well, for those of you who have never met a Muslim, it's great to meet you.</seg>
<seg id="268">Let me tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I'm a mom, a coffee lover -- double espresso, cream on the side.</seg>
<seg id="270">I'm an introvert.</seg>
<seg id="271">I'm a wannabe fitness fanatic.</seg>
<seg id="272">And I'm a practicing, spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga says, because baby, I wasn't born this way.</seg>
<seg id="274">It was a choice.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17, I decided to come out.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a gay person like some of my friends, but as a Muslim, and decided to start wearing the hijab, my head covering.</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist friends were aghast: "Why are you oppressing yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">The funny thing was, it was actually at that time a feminist declaration of independence from the pressure I felt as a 17-year-old, to conform to a perfect and unattainable standard of beauty.</seg>
<seg id="279">I didn't just passively accept the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I wrestled with the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read and reflected and questioned and doubted and, ultimately, believed.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God -- it was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was a trust and a slow surrender that deepened with every reading of the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="284">Its rhythmic beauty sometimes moves me to tears.</seg>
<seg id="285">I see myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Have you ever felt like someone sees you, completely understands you and yet loves you anyway?</seg>
<seg id="287">That's how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">And so later, I got married, and like all good Egyptians, started my career as an engineer.</seg>
<seg id="289">I later had a child, after getting married, and I was living essentially the Egyptian-American dream.</seg>
<seg id="290">And then that terrible morning of September, 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">I think a lot of you probably remember exactly where you were that morning.</seg>
<seg id="292">I was sitting in my kitchen finishing breakfast, and I look up on the screen and see the words "Breaking News."</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, airplanes flying into buildings, people jumping out of buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was this?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A malfunction?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock quickly turned to outrage.</seg>
<seg id="298">Who would do this?</seg>
<seg id="299">And I switch the channel and I hear, "... Muslim terrorist ...," "... in the name of Islam ...," "... Middle-Eastern descent ...," "... jihad ...," "... we should bomb Mecca."</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">Not only had my country been attacked, but in a flash, somebody else's actions had turned me from a citizen to a suspect.</seg>
<seg id="302">That same day, we had to drive across Middle America to move to a new city to start grad school.</seg>
<seg id="303">And I remember sitting in the passenger seat as we drove in silence, crouched as low as I could go in my seat, for the first time in my life, afraid for anyone to know I was a Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved into our apartment that night in a new town in what felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">And then I was hearing and seeing and reading warnings from national Muslim organizations saying things like, "Be alert," "Be aware," "Stay in well-lit areas," "Don't congregate."</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed inside all week.</seg>
<seg id="307">And then it was Friday that same week, the day that Muslims congregate for worship.</seg>
<seg id="308">And again the warnings were, "Don't go that first Friday, it could be a target."</seg>
<seg id="309">And I was watching the news, wall-to-wall coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">Emotions were so raw, understandably, and I was also hearing about attacks on Muslims, or people who were perceived to be Muslim, being pulled out and beaten in the street.</seg>
<seg id="311">Mosques were actually firebombed.</seg>
<seg id="312">And I thought, we should just stay home.</seg>
<seg id="313">And yet, something didn't feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because those people who attacked our country attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I get it that people were angry at the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Guess what? So was I.</seg>
<seg id="317">And so to have to explain yourself all the time isn't easy.</seg>
<seg id="318">I don't mind questions. I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">It's the accusations that are tough.</seg>
<seg id="320">Today we hear people actually saying things like, "There's a problem in this country, and it's called Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When are we going to get rid of them?"</seg>
<seg id="322">So, some people want to ban Muslims and close down mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They talk about my community kind of like we're a tumor in the body of America.</seg>
<seg id="324">And the only question is, are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know, a malignant tumor you extract altogether, and a benign tumor you just keep under surveillance.</seg>
<seg id="326">The choices don't make sense, because it's the wrong question.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims, like all other Americans, aren't a tumor in the body of America, we're a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympic athletes.</seg>
<seg id="330">Now, is closing down mosques going to make America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">It might free up some parking spots, but it will not end terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="332">Going to a mosque regularly is actually linked to having more tolerant views of people of other faiths and greater civic engagement.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as one police chief in the Washington, DC area recently told me, people don't actually get radicalized at mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They get radicalized in their basement or bedroom, in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">And what you find about the radicalization process is it starts online, is the person gets cut off from their community, from even their family, so that the extremist group can brainwash them into believing that they, the terrorists, are the true Muslims, and everyone else who abhors their behavior and ideology are sellouts or apostates.</seg>
<seg id="336">So if we want to prevent radicalization, we have to keep people going to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Now, some will still argue Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">After all, a group like ISIS bases its brutality on the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="339">Now, as a Muslim, as a mother, as a human being, I think we need to do everything we can to stop a group like ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would be giving in to their narrative if we cast them as representatives of a faith of 1.6 billion people.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="342">ISIS has as much to do with Islam as the Ku Klux Klan has to do with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim to base their ideology on their holy book.</seg>
<seg id="344">But when you look at them, they're not motivated by what they read in their holy book.</seg>
<seg id="345">It's their brutality that makes them read these things into the scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">Recently, a prominent imam told me a story that really took me aback.</seg>
<seg id="347">He said that a girl came to him because she was thinking of going to join ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="348">And I was really surprised and asked him, had she been in contact with a radical religious leader?</seg>
<seg id="349">And he said the problem was quite the opposite, that every cleric that she had talked to had shut her down and said that her rage, her sense of injustice in the world, was just going to get her in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">And so with nowhere to channel and make sense of this anger, she was a prime target to be exploited by extremists promising her a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">What this imam did was to connect her back to God and to her community.</seg>
<seg id="352">He didn't shame her for her rage -- instead, he gave her constructive ways to make real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned at that mosque prevented her from going to join ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="354">I've told you a little bit about how Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it impact ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it impact everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does consuming fear 24 hours a day affect the health of our democracy, the health of our free thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">Well, one study -- actually, several studies in neuroscience -- show that when we're afraid, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We become more accepting of authoritarianism, conformity and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="360">One study showed that when subjects were exposed to news stories that were negative about Muslims, they became more accepting of military attacks on Muslim countries and policies that curtail the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">Now, this isn't just academic.</seg>
<seg id="362">When you look at when anti-Muslim sentiment spiked between 2001 and 2013, it happened three times, but it wasn't around terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It was in the run up to the Iraq War and during two election cycles.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia isn't just the natural response to Muslim terrorism as I would have expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool of public manipulation, eroding the very foundation of a free society, which is rational and well-informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Muslims are like canaries in the coal mine.</seg>
<seg id="367">We might be the first to feel it, but the toxic air of fear is harming us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">And assigning collective guilt isn't just about having to explain yourself all the time.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young married couple living in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where they both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was an athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was in dental school, talented, promising ...</seg>
<seg id="372">And his sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous human being she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She was visiting him there and he showed her his resume, and she was amazed.</seg>
<seg id="374">She said, "When did my baby brother become such an accomplished young man?"</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after Suzanne's visit to her brother and his new wife, their neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, murdered them, as well as Yusor's sister, Razan, who was visiting for the afternoon, in their apartment, execution style, after posting anti-Muslim statements on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He shot Deah eight times.</seg>
<seg id="377">So bigotry isn't just immoral, it can even be lethal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So, back to my story.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9/11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or did we play it safe and stay home?</seg>
<seg id="381">Well, we talked it over, and it might seem like a small decision, but to us, it was about what kind of America we wanted to leave for our kids: one that would control us by fear or one where we were practicing our religion freely.</seg>
<seg id="382">So we decided to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">And we put my son in his car seat, buckled him in, and we drove silently, intensely, to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, I took off my shoes, I walked into the prayer hall and what I saw made me stop.</seg>
<seg id="385">The place was completely full.</seg>
<seg id="386">And then the imam made an announcement, thanking and welcoming our guests, because half the congregation were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, people of faith and no faith, who had come not to attack us, but to stand in solidarity with us.</seg>
<seg id="387">I just break down at this time.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they chose courage and compassion over panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose at this time of fear and bigotry?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you play it safe?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join those who say we are better than that?</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you so much.</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: So Dalia, you seem to have struck a chord.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder, what would you say to those who might argue that you're giving a TED Talk, you're clearly a deep thinker, you work at a fancy think tank, you're an exception, you're not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say, don't let this stage distract you, I'm completely ordinary.</seg>
<seg id="399">I'm not an exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am as ordinary as they come.</seg>
<seg id="402">When you look at Muslims around the world -- and I've done this, I've done the largest study ever done on Muslims around the world -- people want ordinary things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity for their family, they want jobs and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I am not in any way an exception.</seg>
<seg id="405">When you meet people who seem like an exception to the rule, oftentimes it's that the rule is broken, not that they're an exception to it.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: Thank you so much. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What started as a platform for hobbyists is poised to become a multibillion-dollar industry.</seg>
<seg id="408">Inspection, environmental monitoring, photography and film and journalism: these are some of the potential applications for commercial drones, and their enablers are the capabilities being developed at research facilities around the world.</seg>
<seg id="409">For example, before aerial package delivery entered our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines built a six-meter-tall tower composed of 1,500 bricks in front of a live audience at the FRAC Centre in France, and several years ago, they started to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By tethering flying machines, they can achieve high speeds and accelerations in very tight spaces.</seg>
<seg id="411">They can also autonomously build tensile structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">Skills learned include how to carry loads, how to cope with disturbances, and in general, how to interact with the physical world.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we want to show you some new projects that we've been working on.</seg>
<seg id="414">Their aim is to push the boundary of what can be achieved with autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">Now, for a system to function autonomously, it must collectively know the location of its mobile objects in space.</seg>
<seg id="416">Back at our lab at ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to locate objects, which then allows us to focus our efforts on the rapid development of highly dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For the demos you will see today, however, we will use new localization technology developed by Verity Studios, a spin-off from our lab.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flying machine uses onboard sensors to determine its location in space and onboard computation to determine what its actions should be.</seg>
<seg id="420">The only external commands are high-level ones such as "take off" and "land."</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called tail-sitter.</seg>
<seg id="422">It's an aircraft that tries to have its cake and eat it.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other fixed-wing aircraft, it is efficient in forward flight, much more so than helicopters and variations thereof.</seg>
<seg id="424">Unlike most other fixed-wing aircraft, however, it is capable of hovering, which has huge advantages for takeoff, landing and general versatility.</seg>
<seg id="425">There is no free lunch, unfortunately.</seg>
<seg id="426">One of the limitations with tail-sitters is that they're susceptible to disturbances such as wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We're developing new control architectures and algorithms that address this limitation.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea is for the aircraft to recover no matter what state it finds itself in, and through practice, improve its performance over time.</seg>
<seg id="429">OK.</seg>
<seg id="430">When doing research, we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions that try to get at the heart of a matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">For example, one such question would be, what is the minimum number of moving parts needed for controlled flight?</seg>
<seg id="432">Now, there are practical reasons why you may want to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters, for example, are affectionately known as machines with a thousand moving parts all conspiring to do you bodily harm.</seg>
<seg id="434">It turns out that decades ago, skilled pilots were able to fly remote-controlled aircraft that had only two moving parts: a propeller and a tail rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">We recently discovered that it could be done with just one.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospinner, the world's mechanically simplest controllable flying machine, invented just a few months ago.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only one moving part, a propeller.</seg>
<seg id="438">It has no flaps, no hinges, no ailerons, no other actuators, no other control surfaces, just a simple propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Even though it's mechanically simple, there's a lot going on in its little electronic brain to allow it to fly in a stable fashion and to move anywhere it wants in space.</seg>
<seg id="440">Even so, it doesn't yet have the sophisticated algorithms of the tail-sitter, which means that in order to get it to fly, I have to throw it just right.</seg>
<seg id="441">And because the probability of me throwing it just right is very low, given everybody watching me, what we're going to do instead is show you a video that we shot last night.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the monospinner is an exercise in frugality, this machine here, the omnicopter, with its eight propellers, is an exercise in excess.</seg>
<seg id="443">What can you do with all this surplus?</seg>
<seg id="444">The thing to notice is that it is highly symmetric.</seg>
<seg id="445">As a result, it is ambivalent to orientation.</seg>
<seg id="446">This gives it an extraordinary capability.</seg>
<seg id="447">It can move anywhere it wants in space irrespective of where it is facing and even of how it is rotating.</seg>
<seg id="448">It has its own complexities, mainly having to do with the interacting flows from its eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some of this can be modeled, while the rest can be learned on the fly.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's take a look.</seg>
<seg id="451">If flying machines are going to enter part of our daily lives, they will need to become extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine over here is actually two separate two-propeller flying machines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This one wants to spin clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="454">This other one wants to spin counterclockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you put them together, they behave like one high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">If anything goes wrong, however -- a motor fails, a propeller fails, electronics, even a battery pack -- the machine can still fly, albeit in a degraded fashion.</seg>
<seg id="457">We're going to demonstrate this to you now by disabling one of its halves.</seg>
<seg id="458">This last demonstration is an exploration of synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated entities offers a new palette for aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We've taken commercially available micro quadcopters, each weighing less than a slice of bread, by the way, and outfitted them with our localization technology and custom algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Because each unit knows where it is in space and is self-controlled, there is really no limit to their number.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully, these demonstrations will motivate you to dream up new revolutionary roles for flying machines.</seg>
<seg id="463">That ultrasafe one over there for example has aspirations to become a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">The reality is that it is difficult to predict the impact of nascent technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">And for folks like us, the real reward is the journey and the act of creation.</seg>
<seg id="466">It's a continual reminder of how wonderful and magical the universe we live in is, that it allows creative, clever creatures to sculpt it in such spectacular ways.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such huge commercial and economic potential is just icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago, in a distant, distant galaxy, two black holes locked into a spiral, converting three Suns' worth of stuff into pure energy in a tenth of a second.</seg>
<seg id="470">For that brief moment in time, the glow was brighter than all the stars in all the galaxies in all of the known Universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they didn't release their energy in light.</seg>
<seg id="473">I mean, you know, they're black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">All that energy was pumped into the fabric of space and time itself, making the Universe explode in gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let me give you a sense of the timescale at work here.</seg>
<seg id="476">1.3 billion years ago, Earth had just managed to evolve multicellular life.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then, Earth has made and evolved corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and even -- God save us -- the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">And about 25 years ago, a particularly audacious set of people -- Rai Weiss at MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever at Caltech -- to build a giant laser detector with which to search for the gravitational waves from things like colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Now, most people thought they were nuts.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people realized that they were brilliant nuts that the US National Science Foundation decided to fund their crazy idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">So after decades of development, construction and imagination and a breathtaking amount of hard work, they built their detector, called LIGO: The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">For the last several years, LIGO's been undergoing a huge expansion in its accuracy, a tremendous improvement in its detection ability.</seg>
<seg id="483">It's now called Advanced LIGO as a result.</seg>
<seg id="484">In early September of 2015, LIGO turned on for a final test run while they sorted out a few lingering details.</seg>
<seg id="485">And on September 14 of 2015, just days after the detector had gone live, the gravitational waves from those colliding black holes passed through the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">And they passed through you and me.</seg>
<seg id="487">And they passed through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: There's two moments in my life more emotionally intense than that.</seg>
<seg id="489">One is the birth of my daughter.</seg>
<seg id="490">The other is when I had to say goodbye to my father when he was terminally ill.</seg>
<seg id="491">You know, it was the payoff of my career, basically.</seg>
<seg id="492">Everything I'd been working on -- it's no longer science fiction! Allan Adams: So that's my very good friend and collaborator, Scott Hughes, a theoretical physicist at MIT, who has been studying gravitational waves from black holes and the signals that they could impart on observatories like LIGO, So let me take a moment to tell you what I mean by a gravitational wave.</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a ripple in the shape of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">As the wave passes by, it stretches space and everything in it in one direction, and compresses it in the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">This has led to countless instructors of general relativity doing a really silly dance to demonstrate in their classes on general relativity.</seg>
<seg id="496">"It stretches and expands, it stretches and expands."</seg>
<seg id="497">So the trouble with gravitational waves is that they're very weak; they're preposterously weak.</seg>
<seg id="498">For example, the waves that hit us on September 14 -- and yes, every single one of you stretched and compressed under the action of that wave -- when the waves hit, they stretched the average person by one part in 10 to the 21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That's a decimal place, 20 zeroes, That's why everyone thought the LIGO people were nuts.</seg>
<seg id="500">Even with a laser detector five kilometers long -- and that's already crazy -- they would have to measure the length of those detectors to less than one thousandth of the radius of the nucleus of an atom.</seg>
<seg id="501">And that's preposterous.</seg>
<seg id="502">So towards the end of his classic text on gravity, described the hunt for gravitational waves as follows: He said, "The technical difficulties to be surmounted in constructing such detectors are enormous.</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicists are ingenious, and with the support of a broad lay public, all obstacles will surely be overcome."</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published that in 1973, 42 years before he succeeded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Now, coming back to LIGO, Scott likes to say that LIGO acts like an ear more than it does like an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what that means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength, a size, that's much smaller than the things around you, the features on people's faces, the size of your cell phone.</seg>
<seg id="508">And that's really useful, because it lets you make an image or a map of the things around you, by looking at the light coming from different spots in the scene about you.</seg>
<seg id="509">Sound is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sound has a wavelength that can be up to 50 feet long.</seg>
<seg id="511">And that makes it really difficult -- in fact, in practical purposes, impossible -- to make an image of something you really care about.</seg>
<seg id="512">Your child's face.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead, we use sound to listen for features like pitch and tone and rhythm and volume to infer a story behind the sounds.</seg>
<seg id="514">That's Alice talking.</seg>
<seg id="515">That's Bob interrupting.</seg>
<seg id="516">Silly Bob.</seg>
<seg id="517">So, the same is true of gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can't use them to make simple images of things out in the Universe.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by listening to changes in the amplitude and frequency of those waves, we can hear the story that those waves are telling.</seg>
<seg id="520">And at least for LIGO, the frequencies that it can hear are in the audio band.</seg>
<seg id="521">So if we convert the wave patterns into pressure waves and air, into sound, we can literally hear the Universe speaking to us.</seg>
<seg id="522">For example, listening to gravity, just in this way, can tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes, something my colleague Scott has spent an awful lot of time thinking about.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: If the two black holes are non-spinning, you get a very simple chirp: whoop!</seg>
<seg id="524">If the two bodies are spinning very rapidly, I have that same chirp, but with a modulation on top of it, so it kind of goes: whir, whir, whir!</seg>
<seg id="525">It's sort of the vocabulary of spin imprinted on this waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: So on September 14, 2015, a date that's definitely going to live in my memory, LIGO heard this: [Whirring sound] So if you know how to listen, that is the sound of -- SH: ... two black holes, each of about 30 solar masses, that were whirling around at a rate comparable to what goes on in your blender.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: It's worth pausing here to think about what that means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest thing in the Universe, one with a mass of 29 Suns and one with a mass of 36 Suns, whirling around each other 100 times per second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Just imagine the power of that.</seg>
<seg id="530">It's fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know it because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">That's the lasting importance of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">It's an entirely new way to observe the Universe that we've never had before.</seg>
<seg id="534">It's a way that lets us hear the Universe and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">And there's a lot out there that we can't see -- in practice or even in principle.</seg>
<seg id="536">So supernova, for example: I would love to know why very massive stars explode in supernovae.</seg>
<seg id="537">They're very useful; we've learned a lot about the Universe from them.</seg>
<seg id="538">The problem is, all the interesting physics happens in the core, and the core is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron and carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We'll never see through it, it's opaque to light.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves go through iron as if it were glass -- The Big Bang: I would love to be able to explore the first few moments of the Universe, but we'll never see them, because the Big Bang itself is obscured by its own afterglow.</seg>
<seg id="541">With gravitational waves, we should be able to see all the way back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">Perhaps most importantly, I'm positive that there are things out there that we've never seen that we may never be able to see and that we haven't even imagined -- things that we'll only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">And in fact, even in that very first event, LIGO found things that we didn't expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">Here's my colleague and one of the key members of the LIGO collaboration, Matt Evans, my colleague at MIT, addressing exactly that: Matt Evans: The kinds of stars which produce the black holes that we observed here are the dinosaurs of the Universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They're these massive things that are old, from prehistoric times, and the black holes are kind of like the dinosaur bones with which we do this archeology.</seg>
<seg id="546">So it lets us really get a whole nother angle on what's out there in the Universe and how the stars came to be, and in the end, of course, how we came to be out of this whole mess.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: Our challenge now is to be as audacious as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to LIGO, we know how to build exquisite detectors that can listen to the Universe, to the rustle and the chirp of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">Our job is to dream up and build new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories -- on the ground, in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">I mean, what could be more glorious than listening to the Big Bang itself?</seg>
<seg id="551">Our job now is to dream big.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">So a while ago, I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">For one year, I would say yes to all the things that scared me.</seg>
<seg id="556">Anything that made me nervous, took me out of my comfort zone, I forced myself to say yes to.</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak in public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes.</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be on live TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes.</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to try acting?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, but yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: the very act of doing the thing that scared me made it not scary.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear of public speaking, my social anxiety, poof, gone.</seg>
<seg id="565">It's amazing, the power of one word.</seg>
<seg id="566">"Yes" changed my life.</seg>
<seg id="567">"Yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was one particular yes that affected my life in the most profound way, in a way I never imagined, and it started with a question from my toddler.</seg>
<seg id="569">I have these three amazing daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson, and Emerson is a toddler who inexplicably refers to everyone as "honey."</seg>
<seg id="570">as though she's a Southern waitress.</seg>
<seg id="571">"Honey, I'm gonna need some milk for my sippy cup."</seg>
<seg id="572">The Southern waitress asked me to play with her one evening when I was on my way somewhere, and I said, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">And that yes was the beginning of a new way of life for my family.</seg>
<seg id="574">I made a vow that from now on, every time one of my children asks me to play, no matter what I'm doing or where I'm going, I say yes, every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect at it, but I try hard to practice it.</seg>
<seg id="576">And it's had a magical effect on me, on my children, on our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it's also had a stunning side effect, and it wasn't until recently that I fully understood it, that I understood that saying yes to playing with my children likely saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">See, I have what most people would call a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I'm a writer. I imagine. I make stuff up for a living.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I'm a titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create television. I executive produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I make television, a great deal of television.</seg>
<seg id="586">In one way or another, this TV season, I'm responsible for bringing about 70 hours of programming to the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four television programs, 70 hours of TV -- Three shows in production at a time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each show creates hundreds of jobs that didn't exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for one episode of network television can be anywhere from three to six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's just say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode made every nine days times four shows, so every nine days that's 20 million dollars worth of television, four television programs, 70 hours of TV, three shows in production at a time, sometimes four, 16 episodes going on at all times: 24 episodes of "Grey's," 21 episodes of "Scandal," 15 episodes of "How To Get Away With Murder," 10 episodes of "The Catch," that's 70 hours of TV,</seg>
<seg id="592">that's 350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America, my television shows are back to back to back on Thursday night.</seg>
<seg id="594">Around the world, my shows air in 256 territories in 67 languages for an audience of 30 million people.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 hours of that 70 hours of TV are shows I personally created and not just produced, so on top of everything else, I need to find time, real quiet, creative time, to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four television programs, 70 hours of TV, three shows in production at a time, sometimes four, 350 million dollars, campfires burning all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">You know who else is doing that?</seg>
<seg id="598">Nobody, so like I said, I'm a titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">Now, I don't tell you this to impress you.</seg>
<seg id="601">I tell you this because I know what you think of when you hear the word "writer."</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you this so that all of you out there who work so hard, whether you run a company or a country or a classroom or a store or a home, take me seriously when I talk about working, so you'll get that I don't peck at a computer and imagine all day, so you'll hear me when I say that I understand that a dream job is not about dreaming.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat, no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, very hard, and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I'm hard at work, when I'm deep in it, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">For me, my work is at all times building a nation out of thin air.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is manning the troops. It is painting a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">It is hitting every high note. It is running a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">It is being Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And it is all of those things at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love working.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative and mechanical and exhausting and exhilarating and hilarious and disturbing and clinical and maternal and cruel and judicious, and what makes it all so good is the hum.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is some kind of shift inside me when the work gets good.</seg>
<seg id="614">A hum begins in my brain, and it grows and it grows and that hum sounds like the open road, and I could drive it forever.</seg>
<seg id="615">And a lot of people, when I try to explain the hum, they assume that I'm talking about the writing, that my writing brings me joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">And don't get me wrong, it does.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the hum -- it wasn't until I started making television that I started working, working and making and building and creating and collaborating, that I discovered this thing, this buzz, this rush, this hum.</seg>
<seg id="618">The hum is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The hum is action and activity. The hum is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The hum is music. The hum is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The hum is God's whisper right in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And when you have a hum like that, you can't help but strive for greatness.</seg>
<seg id="623">That feeling, you can't help but strive for greatness at any cost.</seg>
<seg id="624">That's called the hum.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or, maybe it's called being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it's called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it's called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Maybe it's just fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I just know that I'm not built for failure, and I just know that I love the hum.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just know that I want to tell you I'm a titan, and I know that I don't want to question it.</seg>
<seg id="632">But here's the thing: the more successful I become, the more shows, the more episodes, the more barriers broken, the more work there is to do, the more balls in the air, the more eyes on me, the more history stares, the more expectations there are.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I need to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love working, right?</seg>
<seg id="636">The nation I'm building, the marathon I'm running, the troops, the canvas, the high note, the hum, the hum, the hum.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like that hum. I love that hum.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need that hum. I am that hum.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I nothing but that hum?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the hum stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Overworked, overused, overdone, burned out.</seg>
<seg id="642">The hum stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now, my three daughters are used to the truth that their mother is a single working titan.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people, "My mom won't be there, but you can text my nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">And Emerson says, "Honey, I'm wanting to go to ShondaLand."</seg>
<seg id="646">They're children of a titan.</seg>
<seg id="647">They're baby titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3, and 1 when the hum stopped.</seg>
<seg id="649">The hum of the engine died.</seg>
<seg id="650">I stopped loving work. I couldn't restart the engine.</seg>
<seg id="651">The hum would not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My hum was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I was doing the same things I always did, all the same titan work, 15-hour days, working straight through the weekends, no regrets, never surrender, a titan never sleeps, a titan never quits, full hearts, clear eyes, yada, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no hum.</seg>
<seg id="655">Inside me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four television programs, 70 hours of TV, three shows in production at a time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four television programs, 70 hours of TV, three shows in production at a time ...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a titan you could take home to your mother.</seg>
<seg id="660">All the colors were the same, and I was no longer having any fun.</seg>
<seg id="661">And it was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">It was all I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the hum, and the hum was me.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do when the thing you do, the work you love, starts to taste like dust?</seg>
<seg id="665">Now, I know somebody's out there thinking, "Cry me a river, stupid writer titan lady."</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know, you do, if you make, if you work, if you love what you do, being a teacher, being a banker, being a mother, being a painter, being Bill Gates, if you simply love another person and that gives you the hum, if you know the hum, if you know what the hum feels like, if you have been to the hum, when the hum stops, who are you?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">If the song of my heart ceases to play, can I survive in the silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my Southern waitress toddler asks me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">I'm on my way out the door, I'm late, and she says, "Momma, wanna play?"</seg>
<seg id="673">And I'm just about to say no, when I realize two things.</seg>
<seg id="674">One, I'm supposed to say yes to everything, and two, my Southern waitress didn't call me "honey."</seg>
<seg id="675">She's not calling everyone "honey" anymore.</seg>
<seg id="676">When did that happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I'm missing it, being a titan and mourning my hum, and here she is changing right before my eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">And so she says, "Momma, wanna play?"</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">There's nothing special about it.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play, and we're joined by her sisters, and there's a lot of laughing, and I give a dramatic reading from the book Everybody Poops.</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing out of the ordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">And yet, it is extraordinary, because in my pain and my panic, in the homelessness of my humlessness, I have nothing to do but pay attention.</seg>
<seg id="684">I focus.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am still.</seg>
<seg id="686">The nation I'm building, the marathon I'm running, the troops, the canvas, the high note does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists are sticky fingers and gooey kisses and tiny voices and crayons and that song about letting go of whatever it is that Frozen girl needs to let go of.</seg>
<seg id="688">It's all peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air is so rare in this place for me that I can barely breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can barely believe I'm breathing.</seg>
<seg id="691">Play is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me loosens.</seg>
<seg id="694">A door in my brain swings open, and a rush of energy comes.</seg>
<seg id="695">And it's not instantaneous, but it happens, it does happen.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">A hum creeps back.</seg>
<seg id="698">Not at full volume, barely there, it's quiet, and I have to stay very still to hear it, but it is there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the hum, but a hum.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I know a very magical secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">Well, let's not get carried away.</seg>
<seg id="702">It's just love. That's all it is.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. No secret. It's just love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It's just something we forgot.</seg>
<seg id="705">The hum, the work hum, the hum of the titan, that's just a replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I have to ask you who I am, if I have to tell you who I am, if I describe myself in terms of shows and hours of television and how globally badass my brain is, I have forgotten what the real hum is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The hum is not power and the hum is not work-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">The hum is joy-specific.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real hum is love-specific.</seg>
<seg id="710">The hum is the electricity that comes from being excited by life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real hum is confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real hum ignores the stare of history, and the balls in the air, and the expectation, and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real hum is singular and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real hum is God's whisper in my ear, but maybe God was whispering the wrong words, because which one of the gods was telling me I was the titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It's just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We could all use a little more love, a lot more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">Any time my child asks me to play, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I make it a firm rule for one reason, to give myself permission, to free me from all of my workaholic guilt.</seg>
<seg id="719">It's a law, so I don't have a choice, and I don't have a choice, not if I want to feel the hum.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it were that easy, but I'm not good at playing.</seg>
<seg id="721">I'm not interested in doing it the way I'm interested in doing work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth is incredibly humbling and humiliating to face.</seg>
<seg id="723">I don't like playing.</seg>
<seg id="724">I work all the time because I like working.</seg>
<seg id="725">I like working more than I like being at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">Facing that fact is incredibly difficult to handle, because what kind of person likes working more than being at home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, me.</seg>
<seg id="728">I mean, let's be honest, I call myself a titan.</seg>
<seg id="729">I've got issues.</seg>
<seg id="730">And one of those issues isn't that I am too relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="731">We run around the yard, up and back and up and back.</seg>
<seg id="732">We have 30-second dance parties.</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing show tunes. We play with balls.</seg>
<seg id="734">I blow bubbles and they pop them.</seg>
<seg id="735">And I feel stiff and delirious and confused most of the time.</seg>
<seg id="736">I itch for my cell phone always.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is OK.</seg>
<seg id="738">My tiny humans show me how to live and the hum of the universe fills me up.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and I play until I begin to wonder why we ever stop playing in the first place.</seg>
<seg id="740">You can do it too, say yes every time your child asks you to play.</seg>
<seg id="741">Are you thinking that maybe I'm an idiot in diamond shoes?</seg>
<seg id="742">You're right, but you can still do this.</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time.</seg>
<seg id="744">You know why? Because you're not Rihanna and you're not a Muppet.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child does not think you're that interesting.</seg>
<seg id="746">You only need 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My two- and four-year-old only ever want to play with me for about 15 minutes or so before they think to themselves they want to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">It's an amazing 15 minutes, but it's 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">If I'm not a ladybug or a piece of candy, I'm invisible after 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="750">And my 13-year-old, if I can get a 13-year-old to talk to me for 15 minutes I'm Parent of the Year.</seg>
<seg id="751">15 minutes is all you need.</seg>
<seg id="752">I can totally pull off 15 minutes of uninterrupted time on my worst day.</seg>
<seg id="753">Uninterrupted is the key.</seg>
<seg id="754">No cell phone, no laundry, no anything.</seg>
<seg id="755">You have a busy life. You have to get dinner on the table.</seg>
<seg id="756">You have to force them to bathe. But you can do 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="757">My kids are my happy place, they're my world, but it doesn't have to be your kids, the fuel that feeds your hum, the place where life feels more good than not good.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your kids, it's about joy.</seg>
<seg id="759">It's about playing in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Give yourself the 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="761">Find what makes you feel good.</seg>
<seg id="762">Just figure it out and play in that arena.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect at it. In fact, I fail as often as I succeed, seeing friends, reading books, staring into space.</seg>
<seg id="764">"Wanna play?" starts to become shorthand for indulging myself in ways I'd given up on right around the time I got my first TV show, right around the time I became a titan-in-training, right around the time I started competing with myself for ways unknown.</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes? What could be wrong with giving myself my full attention for 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">Turns out, nothing.</seg>
<seg id="767">The very act of not working has made it possible for the hum to return, as if the hum's engine could only refuel while I was away.</seg>
<seg id="768">Work doesn't work without play.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes a little time, but after a few months, one day the floodgates open and there's a rush, and I find myself standing in my office filled with an unfamiliar melody, full on groove inside me, and around me, and it sends me spinning with ideas, and the humming road is open, and I can drive it and drive it, and I love working again.</seg>
<seg id="770">But now, I like that hum, but I don't love that hum.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need that hum.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not that hum. That hum is not me, not anymore.</seg>
<seg id="773">I am bubbles and sticky fingers and dinners with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">I am that hum.</seg>
<seg id="775">Life's hum.</seg>
<seg id="776">Love's hum.</seg>
<seg id="777">Work's hum is still a piece of me, it is just no longer all of me, and I am so grateful.</seg>
<seg id="778">And I don't give a crap about being a titan, because I have never once seen a titan play Red Rover, Red Rover.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and more play, and somehow I still run my world.</seg>
<seg id="780">My brain is still global. My campfires still burn.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the happier I am, and the happier my kids are.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel like a good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the freer my mind becomes.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I feel the hum, the nation I'm building, the marathon I'm running, the troops, the canvas, the high note, the hum, the hum, the other hum, the real hum, life's hum.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel that hum, the more this strange, quivering, uncocooned, awkward, brand new, alive non-titan feels like me.</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel that hum, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I'm a writer, I make stuff up, I imagine.</seg>
<seg id="789">That part of the job, that's living the dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">That's the dream of the job.</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dream job should be a little bit dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said yes to less work and more play.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans need not apply.</seg>
<seg id="794">Wanna play?</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="796">So I'm a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">And like most of my colleagues, I have to deal, every day, with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I realize how your life can change from one second to the other after a major stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">And what is very frustrating for us neurosurgeons is to realize that unlike other organs of the body, the brain has very little ability for self-repair.</seg>
<seg id="800">And after a major injury of your central nervous system, the patients often remain with a severe handicap.</seg>
<seg id="801">And that's probably the reason why I've chosen to be a functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">It's a doctor who is trying to improve a neurological function through different surgical strategies.</seg>
<seg id="804">You've certainly heard of one of the famous ones called deep brain stimulation, where you implant an electrode in the depths of the brain in order to modulate a circuit of neurons to improve a neurological function.</seg>
<seg id="805">It's really an amazing technology in that it has improved the destiny of patients with Parkinson's disease, with severe tremor, with severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">However, neuromodulation does not mean neuro-repair.</seg>
<seg id="807">And the dream of functional neurosurgeons is to repair the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">I think that we are approaching this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">And I would like to show you that we are very close to this.</seg>
<seg id="810">And that with a little bit of help, the brain is able to help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">So the story started 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At that time, I was a chief resident working days and nights in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often had to take care of patients with head trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You have to imagine that when a patient comes in with a severe head trauma, his brain is swelling and he's increasing his intracranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="815">And in order to save his life, you have to decrease this intracranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">you sometimes have to remove a piece of swollen brain.</seg>
<seg id="817">So instead of throwing away these pieces of swollen brain, we decided with Jean-François Brunet, who is a colleague of mine, a biologist, to study them.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from these pieces of tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">It's not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Growing cells from a piece of tissue is a bit the same as growing very small children out from their family.</seg>
<seg id="822">So you need to find the right nutrients, the warmth, the humidity and all the nice environments to make them thrive.</seg>
<seg id="823">So that's exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">And after many attempts, Jean-François did it.</seg>
<seg id="825">And that's what he saw under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">And that was, for us, a major surprise.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">Because this looks exactly the same as a stem cell culture, with large green cells surrounding small, immature cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">And you may remember from biology class that stem cells are immature cells, able to turn into any type of cell of the body.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but they're very rare and they're located in deep and small niches in the depths of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">So it was surprising to get this kind of stem cell culture from the superficial part of swollen brain we had in the operating theater.</seg>
<seg id="832">And there was another intriguing observation: Regular stem cells are very active cells -- cells that divide, divide, divide very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">And they never die, they're immortal cells.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behave differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They divide slowly, and after a few weeks of culture, they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we were in front of a strange new cell population that looked like stem cells but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">And it took us a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">All of you have them in your brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They represent four percent of your cortical brain cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They have a very important role during the development stage.</seg>
<seg id="843">When you were fetuses, they helped your brain to fold itself.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay in your head?</seg>
<seg id="845">This, we don't know.</seg>
<seg id="846">We think that they may participate in brain repair because we find them in higher concentration close to brain lesions.</seg>
<seg id="847">But it's not so sure.</seg>
<seg id="848">But there is one clear thing -- that from these cells, we got our stem cell culture.</seg>
<seg id="849">And we were in front of a potential new source of cells to repair the brain.</seg>
<seg id="850">And we had to prove this.</seg>
<seg id="851">we decided to design an experimental paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="852">The idea was to biopsy a piece of brain in a non-eloquent area of the brain, and then to culture the cells exactly the way Jean-François did it in his lab.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then label them, to put color in them in order to be able to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">And the last step was to re-implant them in the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call these autologous grafts -- autografts.</seg>
<seg id="856">So the first question we had, "What will happen if we re-implant these cells in a normal brain, and what will happen if we re-implant the same cells in a lesioned brain?"</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of professor Eric Rouiller, we worked with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">So in the first-case scenario, we re-implanted the cells in the normal brain and what we saw is that they completely disappeared after a few weeks, as if they were taken from the brain, they go back home, the space is already busy, they are not needed there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second-case scenario, we performed the lesion, we re-implanted exactly the same cells, and in this case, the cells remained -- and they became mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">And that's the image of what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">Those are the cells that were re-implanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">And the proof they carry, these little spots, those are the cells that we've labeled in vitro, when they were in culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">But we could not stop here, of course.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover after a lesion?</seg>
<seg id="865">So for that, we trained monkeys to perform a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to retrieve food pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They were very good at it.</seg>
<seg id="868">And when they had reached a plateau of performance, we did a lesion in the motor cortex corresponding to the hand motion.</seg>
<seg id="869">So the monkeys were plegic, they could not move their hand anymore.</seg>
<seg id="870">And exactly the same as humans would do, they spontaneously recovered to a certain extent, exactly the same as after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are completely plegic, and then they try to recover due to a brain plasticity mechanism, they recover to a certain extent, exactly the same for the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">So when we were sure that the monkey had reached his plateau of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">So on the left side, you see the monkey that has spontaneously recovered.</seg>
<seg id="874">He's at about 40 to 50 percent of his previous performance before the lesion.</seg>
<seg id="875">He's not so accurate, not so quick.</seg>
<seg id="876">And look now, when we re-impant the cells: Two months after re-implantation, the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="877">It was also very exciting results for us, I tell you.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time, we've understood much more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We know that we can cryopreserve them, we can use them later on.</seg>
<seg id="880">We know that we can apply them in other neuropathological models, like Parkinson's disease, for example.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implant them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">And I really hope that I'll be able to show you soon that the human brain is giving us the tools to repair itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is amazing, and I'm sure that right now, there are several dozen people in the audience, possibly even a majority, who are thinking, "I know somebody who can use this."</seg>
<seg id="885">I do, in any case.</seg>
<seg id="886">And of course the question is, what are the biggest obstacles before you can go into human clinical trials?</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: The biggest obstacles are regulations. So, from these exciting results, you need to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to be able to go through these kind of trials.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: Which is understandable, the brain is delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: Yes, it is, but it takes a long time and a lot of patience and almost a professional team to do it, you know?</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: If you project yourself -- having done the research and having tried to get permission to start the trials, if you project yourself out in time, how many years before somebody gets into a hospital and this therapy is available?</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: So, it's very difficult to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">It depends, first, on the approval of the trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the regulation allow us to do it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">And then, you have to perform this kind of study in a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">So it takes, already, a long time to select the patients, do the treatment and evaluate if it's useful to do this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">And then you have to deploy this to a multicentric trial.</seg>
<seg id="897">You have to really prove first that it's useful before offering this treatment up for everybody.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: And safe, of course. JB: Of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for coming to TED and sharing this.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">In the West, we make a colossal mistake taking it for granted.</seg>
<seg id="903">We see democracy not as the most fragile of flowers that it really is, but we see it as part of our society's furniture.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to think of it as an intransigent given.</seg>
<seg id="905">We mistakenly believe that capitalism begets inevitably democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">It doesn't.</seg>
<seg id="907">Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew and his great imitators in Beijing that it is perfectly possible to have a flourishing capitalism, spectacular growth, while politics remains democracy-free.</seg>
<seg id="908">Indeed, democracy is receding in our neck of the woods, here in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">Earlier this year, while I was representing Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- in the Eurogroup as its Finance Minister, I was told in no uncertain terms that our nation's democratic process -- our elections -- could not be allowed to interfere with economic policies that were being implemented in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At that moment, I felt that there could be no greater vindication of Lee Kuan Yew, or the Chinese Communist Party, indeed of some recalcitrant friends of mine who kept telling me that democracy would be banned if it ever threatened to change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">Tonight, here, I want to present to you an economic case for an authentic democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I want to ask you to join me in believing again that Lee Kuan Yew, the Chinese Communist Party and indeed the Eurogroup are wrong in believing that we can dispense with democracy -- that we need an authentic, boisterous democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">And without democracy, our societies will be nastier, our future bleak and our great, new technologies wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">Speaking of waste, allow me to point out an interesting paradox that is threatening our economies as we speak.</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the twin peaks paradox.</seg>
<seg id="916">One peak you understand -- you know it, you recognize it -- is the mountain of debts that has been casting a long shadow over the United States, Europe, the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the mountain of debts.</seg>
<seg id="918">But few people discern its twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of idle cash belonging to rich savers and to corporations, too terrified to invest it into the productive activities that can generate the incomes from which you can extinguish the mountain of debts and which can produce all those things that humanity desperately needs, like green energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">Now let me give you two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the last three months, in the United States, in Britain and in the Eurozone, we have invested, collectively, 3.4 trillion dollars on all the wealth-producing goods -- things like industrial plants, machinery, office blocks, schools, roads, railways, machinery, and so on and so forth.</seg>
<seg id="922">$3.4 trillion sounds like a lot of money until you compare it to the $5.1 trillion that has been slushing around in the same countries, in our financial institutions, doing absolutely nothing during the same period except inflating stock exchanges and bidding up house prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">So a mountain of debt and a mountain of idle cash form twin peaks, failing to cancel each other out through the normal operation of the markets.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnant wages, more than a quarter of 25- to 54-year-olds in America, in Japan and in Europe And consequently, low aggregate demand, which in a never-ending cycle, reinforces the pessimism of the investors, who, fearing low demand, reproduce it by not investing -- exactly like Oedipus' father, who, terrified by the prophecy of the oracle that his son would grow up to kill him,</seg>
<seg id="925">unwittingly engineered the conditions that ensured that Oedipus, his son, would kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my quarrel with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="927">Its gross wastefulness, all this idle cash, should be energized to improve lives, to develop human talents, and indeed to finance all these technologies, green technologies, which are absolutely essential for saving planet Earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">Am I right in believing that democracy might be the answer?</seg>
<seg id="929">I believe so, but before we move on, what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the constitution in which the free and the poor, being in the majority, control government.</seg>
<seg id="931">Now, of course Athenian democracy excluded too many.</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, migrants and, of course, the slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">But it would be a mistake to dismiss the significance of ancient Athenian democracy on the basis of whom it excluded.</seg>
<seg id="934">What was more pertinent, and continues to be so about ancient Athenian democracy, was the inclusion of the working poor, who not only acquired the right to free speech, but more importantly, crucially, they acquired the rights to political judgments that were afforded equal weight in the decision-making concerning matters of state.</seg>
<seg id="935">Now, of course, Athenian democracy didn't last long.</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that burns brightly, it burned out quickly.</seg>
<seg id="937">And indeed, our liberal democracies today do not have their roots in ancient Athens.</seg>
<seg id="938">They have their roots in the Magna Carta, in the 1688 Glorious Revolution, indeed in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">Whereas Athenian democracy was focusing on the masterless citizen and empowering the working poor, our liberal democracies are founded on the Magna Carta tradition, which was, after all, a charter for masters.</seg>
<seg id="940">And indeed, liberal democracy only surfaced when it was possible to separate fully the political sphere from the economic sphere, so as to confine the democratic process fully in the political sphere, leaving the economic sphere -- the corporate world, if you want -- as a democracy-free zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">Now, in our democracies today, this separation of the economic from the political sphere, it gave rise to an inexorable, epic struggle between the two, with the economic sphere colonizing the political sphere, eating into its power.</seg>
<seg id="942">Have you wondered why politicians are not what they used to be?</seg>
<seg id="943">It's not because their DNA has degenerated.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is rather because one can be in government today and not in power, because power has migrated from the political to the economic sphere, which is separate.</seg>
<seg id="945">I spoke about my quarrel with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is a little bit like a population of predators, that are so successful in decimating the prey that they must feed on, that in the end they starve.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, the economic sphere has been colonizing and cannibalizing the political sphere to such an extent that it is undermining itself, Corporate power is increasing, political goods are devaluing, inequality is rising, aggregate demand is falling and CEOs of corporations are too scared to invest the cash of their corporations.</seg>
<seg id="948">So the more capitalism succeeds in taking the demos out of democracy, the taller the twin peaks and the greater the waste of human resources and humanity's wealth.</seg>
<seg id="949">Clearly, if this is right, we must reunite the political and economic spheres and better do it with a demos being in control, like in ancient Athens except without the slaves or the exclusion of women and migrants.</seg>
<seg id="950">Now, this is not an original idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had that idea 100 years ago and it didn't go very well, did it?</seg>
<seg id="952">The lesson that we learned from the Soviet debacle is that only by a miracle will the working poor be reempowered, as they were in ancient Athens, without creating new forms of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: eliminate the working poor.</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism's doing it by replacing low-wage workers with automata, androids, robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is that as long as the economic and the political spheres are separate, automation makes the twin peaks taller, the waste loftier and the social conflicts deeper, including -- soon, I believe -- in places like China.</seg>
<seg id="956">So we need to reconfigure, we need to reunite the economic and the political spheres, but we'd better do it by democratizing the reunified sphere, lest we end up with a surveillance-mad hyperautocracy that makes The Matrix, the movie, look like a documentary.</seg>
<seg id="957">So the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technological innovations it is spawning.</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism will be succeeded by something resembling a Matrix dystopia or something much closer to a Star Trek-like society, where machines serve the humans and the humans expend their energies exploring the universe and indulging in long debates about the meaning of life in some ancient, Athenian-like, high tech agora.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we can afford to be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">But what would it take, what would it look like to have this Star Trek-like utopia, instead of the Matrix-like dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical terms, allow me to share just briefly, a couple of examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">At the level of the enterprise, imagine a capital market, where you earn capital as you work, and where your capital follows you from one job to another, from one company to another, and the company -- whichever one you happen to work at at that time -- is solely owned by those who happen to work in it at that moment.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income stems from capital, from profits, and the very concept of wage labor becomes obsolete.</seg>
<seg id="964">No more separation between those who own but do not work in the company and those who work but do not own the company; no more tug-of-war between capital and labor; no great gap between investment and saving; indeed, no towering twin peaks.</seg>
<seg id="965">At the level of the global political economy, imagine for a moment that our national currencies have a free-floating exchange rate, with a universal, global, digital currency, one that is issued by the International Monetary Fund, on behalf of all humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">And imagine further that all international trade is denominated in this currency -- let's call it "the cosmos," in units of cosmos -- with every government agreeing to be paying into a common fund a sum of cosmos units proportional to the country's trade deficit, or indeed to a country's trade surplus.</seg>
<seg id="967">And imagine that that fund is utilized to invest in green technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funding is scarce.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It's what, effectively, John Maynard Keynes proposed in 1944 at the Bretton Woods Conference.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem is that back then, they didn't have the technology to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Now we do, especially in the context of a reunified political-economic sphere.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world that I am describing to you is simultaneously libertarian, in that it prioritizes empowered individuals, Marxist, since it will have confined to the dustbin of history the division between capital and labor, and Keynesian, global Keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all else, it is a world in which we will be able to imagine an authentic democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will such a world dawn?</seg>
<seg id="975">Or shall we descend into a Matrix-like dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer lies in the political choice that we shall be making collectively.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is our choice, and we'd better make it democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis ...</seg>
<seg id="980">It was you who described yourself in your bios as a libertarian Marxist.</seg>
<seg id="981">What is the relevance of Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: Well, if there was any relevance in what I just said, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">Because the whole point of reunifying the political and economic is -- if we don't do it, then technological innovation is going to create such a massive fall in aggregate demand, what Larry Summers refers to as secular stagnation.</seg>
<seg id="984">With this crisis migrating from one part of the world, as it is now, it will destabilize not only our democracies, but even the emerging world that is not that keen on liberal democracy.</seg>
<seg id="985">So if this analysis holds water, then Marx is absolutely relevant.</seg>
<seg id="986">But so is Hayek, that's why I'm a libertarian Marxist, and so is Keynes, so that's why I'm totally confused.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: Indeed, and possibly we are too, now.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: If you are not confused, you are not thinking, OK?</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: That's a very, very Greek philosopher kind of thing to say -- YV: That was Einstein, actually -- BG: During your talk you mentioned Singapore and China, and last night at the speaker dinner, you expressed a pretty strong opinion about how the West looks at China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to share that?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: Well, there's a great degree of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies, we have a semblance of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">It's because we have confined, as I was saying in my talk, democracy to the political sphere, while leaving the one sphere where all the action is -- the economic sphere -- a completely democracy-free zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a sense, if I am allowed to be provocative, China today is closer to Britain in the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">Because remember, we tend to associate liberalism with democracy -- that's a mistake, historically.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, liberal, it's like John Stuart Mill.</seg>
<seg id="997">John Stuart Mill was particularly skeptical about the democratic process.</seg>
<seg id="998">So what you are seeing now in China is a very similar process to the one that we had in Britain during the Industrial Revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">And to be castigating China for doing that which the West did in the 19th century, smacks of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many people here are wondering about your experience as the Finance Minister of Greece earlier this year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I knew this was coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: Yes.</seg>
<seg id="1003">BG: Six months after, how do you look back at the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: Extremely exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing, because we had an opportunity to reboot the Eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not just Greece, the Eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1006">To move away from the complacency and the constant denial that there was a massive -- and there is a massive architectural fault line going through the Eurozone, which is threatening, massively, the whole of the European Union process.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had an opportunity on the basis of the Greek program -- was the first program to manifest that denial -- to put it right.</seg>
<seg id="1008">And, unfortunately, the powers in the Eurozone, in the Eurogroup, chose to maintain denial.</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what happens.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union.</seg>
<seg id="1011">When you try to keep alive an economic system that architecturally cannot survive, through political will and through authoritarianism, you may succeed in prolonging it, but when change happens it happens very abruptly and catastrophically.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: What kind of change are you foreseeing?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: Well, there's no doubt that if we don't change the architecture of the Eurozone, the Eurozone has no future.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: Did you make any mistakes when you were Finance Minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: Every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: For example? YV: Anybody who looks back -- No, but seriously.</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there's any Minister of Finance, or of anything else for that matter, who tells you after six months in a job, especially in such a stressful situation, that they have made no mistake, they're dangerous people.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The greatest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of a loan agreement in the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I was imagining that there was a genuine interest on the side of the creditors to find common ground.</seg>
<seg id="1021">And there wasn't.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They were simply interested in crushing our government, just because they did not want to have to deal with the architectural fault lines that were running through the Eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">And because they didn't want to admit that for five years they were implementing a catastrophic program in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one-third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">This is worse than the Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="1026">And no one has come clean from the troika of lenders that have been imposing this policy to say, "This was a colossal mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: Despite all this, and despite the aggressiveness of the discussion, you seem to be remaining quite pro-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: Absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">Look, my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone comes from a person who lives and breathes Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1030">My greatest fear is that the Eurozone will not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">Because if it doesn't, the centrifugal forces that will be unleashed and they will destroy the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1032">And that will be catastrophic not just for Europe but for the whole global economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the largest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">And if we allow ourselves to fall into a route of the postmodern 1930's, which seems to me to be what we are doing, then that will be detrimental to the future of Europeans and non-Europeans alike.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: We definitely hope you are wrong on that point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you for coming to TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">Roy Price is a man that most of you have probably never heard about, even though he may have been responsible for 22 somewhat mediocre minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">He may have also been responsible for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">And all of that goes back to a decision that Roy had to make about three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">So you see, Roy Price is a senior executive with Amazon Studios.</seg>
<seg id="1042">That's the TV production company of Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He's 47 years old, slim, spiky hair, describes himself on Twitter as "movies, TV, technology, tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">And Roy Price has a very responsible job, because it's his responsibility to pick the shows, the original content that Amazon is going to make.</seg>
<seg id="1045">And of course that's a highly competitive space.</seg>
<seg id="1046">I mean, there are so many TV shows already out there, that Roy can't just choose any show.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows that are really, really great.</seg>
<seg id="1048">So in other words, he has to find shows that are on the very right end of this curve here.</seg>
<seg id="1049">So this curve here is the rating distribution of about 2,500 TV shows on the website IMDB, and the rating goes from one to 10, and the height here shows you how many shows get that rating.</seg>
<seg id="1050">So if your show gets a rating of nine points or higher, that's a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a top two percent show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">That's shows like "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire," so all of these shows that are addictive, whereafter you've watched a season, your brain is basically like, "Where can I get more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">That kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left side, just for clarity, here on that end, you have a show called "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- which should tell you enough about what's going on on that end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Now, Roy Price is not worried about getting on the left end of the curve, because I think you would have to have some serious brainpower to undercut "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">So what he's worried about is this middle bulge here, the bulge of average TV, you know, those shows that aren't really good or really bad, they don't really get you excited.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he needs to make sure that he's really on the right end of this.</seg>
<seg id="1058">So the pressure is on, and of course it's also the first time that Amazon is even doing something like this, so Roy Price does not want to take any chances.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to engineer success.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs a guaranteed success, and so what he does is, he holds a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">So he takes a bunch of ideas for TV shows, and from those ideas, through an evaluation, they select eight candidates for TV shows, and then he just makes the first episode of each one of these shows and puts them online for free for everyone to watch.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And so when Amazon is giving out free stuff, you're going to take it, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">So millions of viewers are watching those episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">What they don't realize is that, while they're watching their shows, actually, they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are being watched by Roy Price and his team, who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">They record when somebody presses play, when somebody presses pause, what parts they skip, what parts they watch again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">So they collect millions of data points, because they want to have those data points to then decide which show they should make.</seg>
<seg id="1068">And sure enough, so they collect all the data, they do all the data crunching, and an answer emerges, and the answer is, "Amazon should do a sitcom about four Republican US Senators."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They did that show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">So does anyone know the name of the show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems like not too many of you here remember that show, actually, because it didn't turn out that great.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's actually just an average show, actually -- literally, in fact, because the average of this curve here is at 7.4, and "Alpha House" lands at 7.5, so a slightly above average show, but certainly not what Roy Price and his team were aiming for.</seg>
<seg id="1073">Meanwhile, however, at about the same time, at another company, another executive did manage to land a top show using data analysis, and his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, who is the Chief Content Officer of Netflix, and just like Roy, he's on a constant mission to find that great TV show, and he uses data as well to do that, except he does it a little bit differently.</seg>
<seg id="1074">So instead of holding a competition, what he did -- and his team of course -- was they looked at all the data they already had about Netflix viewers, you know, the ratings they give their shows, the viewing histories, what shows people like, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1075">And then they use that data to discover all of these little bits and pieces about the audience: what kinds of shows they like, what kind of producers, what kind of actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">And once they had all of these pieces together, they took a leap of faith, and they decided to license not a sitcom about four Senators but a drama series about a single Senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">You guys know the show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards," and Netflix of course, nailed it with that show, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"House of Cards" gets a 9.1 rating on this curve, so it's exactly where they wanted it to be.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Now, the question of course is, what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">So you have two very competitive, data-savvy companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect all of these millions of data points, and then it works beautifully for one of them, and it doesn't work for the other one.</seg>
<seg id="1083">So why?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic kind of tells you that this should be working all the time.</seg>
<seg id="1085">I mean, if you're collecting millions of data points on a decision you're going to make, then you should be able to make a pretty good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics to rely on.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You're amplifying it with very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least you could expect is good TV, right?</seg>
<seg id="1089">And if data analysis does not work that way, then it actually gets a little scary, because we live in a time where we're turning to data more and more to make very serious decisions that go far beyond TV.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone here know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that's good actually.</seg>
<seg id="1092">OK, so Multi-Health Systems is a software company, and I hope that nobody here in this room ever comes into contact with that software, because if you do, it means you're in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone here in the US is in prison, and they apply for parole, then it's very likely that data analysis software from that company will be used in determining whether to grant that parole.</seg>
<seg id="1094">So it's the same principle as Amazon and Netflix, but now instead of deciding whether a TV show is going to be good or bad, you're deciding whether a person is going to be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">And mediocre TV, 22 minutes, that can be pretty bad, but more years in prison, I guess, even worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">And unfortunately, there is actually some evidence that this data analysis, despite having lots of data, does not always produce optimum results.</seg>
<seg id="1097">And that's not because a company like Multi-Health Systems doesn't know what to do with data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the most data-savvy companies get it wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google gets it wrong sometimes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that they were able, with data analysis, to predict outbreaks of influenza, the nasty kind of flu, by doing data analysis on their Google searches.</seg>
<seg id="1101">And it worked beautifully, and it made a big splash in the news, including the pinnacle of scientific success: a publication in the journal "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked beautifully for year after year after year, until one year it failed.</seg>
<seg id="1103">And nobody could even tell exactly why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It just didn't work that year, and of course that again made big news, of a publication from the journal "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">So even the most data-savvy companies, Amazon and Google, they sometimes get it wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1106">And despite all those failures, data is moving rapidly into real-life decision-making -- into the workplace, law enforcement, medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should better make sure that data is helping.</seg>
<seg id="1108">Now, personally I've seen a lot of this struggle with data myself, because I work in computational genetics, which is also a field where lots of very smart people are using unimaginable amounts of data to make pretty serious decisions like deciding on a cancer therapy or developing a drug.</seg>
<seg id="1109">And over the years, I've noticed a sort of pattern or kind of rule, if you will, about the difference between successful decision-making with data and unsuccessful decision-making, and I find this a pattern worth sharing, and it goes something like this.</seg>
<seg id="1110">So whenever you're solving a complex problem, you're doing essentially two things.</seg>
<seg id="1111">The first one is, you take that problem apart into its bits and pieces so that you can deeply analyze those bits and pieces, You put all of these bits and pieces back together again to come to your conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1112">And sometimes you have to do it over again, but it's always those two things: taking apart and putting back together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the crucial thing is that data and data analysis is only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help you taking a problem apart and understanding its pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1115">It's not suited to put those pieces back together again and then to come to a conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There's another tool that can do that, and we all have it, and that tool is the brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there's one thing a brain is good at, it's taking bits and pieces back together again, even when you have incomplete information, and coming to a good conclusion, especially if it's the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">And that's why I believe that Netflix was so successful, because they used data and brains where they belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to first understand lots of pieces about their audience that they otherwise wouldn't have been able to understand at that depth, but then the decision to take all these bits and pieces and put them back together again and make a show like "House of Cards," that was nowhere in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team made that decision to license that show, which also meant, by the way, that they were taking a pretty big personal risk with that decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">And Amazon, on the other hand, they did it the wrong way around.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data all the way to drive their decision-making, first when they held their competition of TV ideas, then when they selected "Alpha House" to make as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Which of course was a very safe decision for them, because they could always point at the data, saying, "This is what the data tells us."</seg>
<seg id="1124">But it didn't lead to the exceptional results that they were hoping for.</seg>
<seg id="1125">So data is of course a massively useful tool to make better decisions, but I believe that things go wrong when data is starting to drive those decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful, data is just a tool, and to keep that in mind, I find this device here quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will ...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the decision-making device to use.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many of you will know this.</seg>
<seg id="1130">This toy here is called the Magic 8 Ball, and it's really amazing, because if you have a decision to make, a yes or no question, all you have to do is you shake the ball, and then you get an answer -- "Most Likely" -- right here in this window in real time.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I'll have it out later for tech demos.</seg>
<seg id="1132">Now, the thing is, of course -- so I've made some decisions in my life where, in hindsight, I should have just listened to the ball.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, you know, of course, if you have the data available, you want to replace this with something much more sophisticated, like data analysis to come to a better decision.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But that does not change the basic setup.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So the ball may get smarter and smarter and smarter, but I believe it's still on us to make the decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary, on the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I find that a very encouraging message, in fact, that even in the face of huge amounts of data, it still pays off to make decisions, to be an expert in what you're doing and take risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because in the end, it's not data, it's risks that will land you on the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you.</seg>
