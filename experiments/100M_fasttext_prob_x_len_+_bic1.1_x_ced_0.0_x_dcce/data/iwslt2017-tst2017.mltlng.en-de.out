this is James R@@ isen .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times re@@ porter .
&quot; long before someone heard from Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he published spectacular that the N@@ SA illeg@@ ally heard tel@@ eph@@ ones of Americans . &quot;
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
&quot; in this , he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation in which the CIA transferred literally dra@@ fts for a nuclear bomb . &quot;
&quot; if that sounds crazy , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who didn &apos;t like the chapter ?
the U.S. government .
&quot; for almost 10 years , the government has determined against crises and asked him to call his alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this turn , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern to condemn whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and spy on journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the First Constitution , the media has the right to publish secret information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to apply this right , if media do not receive this information , and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous ones they reveal . &quot;
&quot; so when the government kno@@ cked at R@@ isen , he did something that many brave re@@ porters did before him : he refused and said he would rather go to jail . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen was living with the risk of being imprisoned . &quot;
&quot; but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , even though they had argued for years that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government have been dropped . &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring the re@@ porters and sources can always hide less .
&quot; instead of failing and giving rise to statements , this could also carry out his digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , kept his phone @-@ proof secret , &quot;
&quot; just like its e @-@ mail data , financial and bank information , its credit facility , and even a number of impulses with the list of its flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ ens supposedly Source . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers in his attempt to protect whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , but instead the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned him more than all US governments in front of him . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as a secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article about national security has been the result of whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers going to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional review , because the government has more and more possibilities to sp@@ lash out all . &quot;
&quot; but just as the government &apos;s technology allows re@@ vis@@ ing the rights of re@@ porters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; and indeed , they can take this from the moment they contact , rather than in hind@@ sight , in the witness stand . &quot;
&quot; today , there is communication software that has not yet existed when R@@ isen has written his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls . &quot;
&quot; such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open @-@ source transmission system for whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers , originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is today developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation where I work . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an email , go to a news website , such as the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload documents or send information , just like with any ordinary contact form . &quot;
&quot; these are then encrypted and stored on a server , to which only the respective news agency access has access . &quot;
&quot; so the government cannot obtain more information in secret , and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset . &quot;
&quot; Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is , however , only a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new spi@@ onage technologies that thre@@ aten us all . &quot;
&quot; it is important to us to ensure that not only technology divi@@ ders , such as Edward Snow@@ den , have a possibility to commit wrong@@ doing . it is equally important that we protect the next whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers , &quot;
or to report about gri@@ ev@@ ances in the supply of soldiers and report about crowded hospitals . or the next environmental employee who suggests the alarm for poll@@ uted water from Flin@@ t . or a wall@@ street insi@@ der that warns us about the next financial crisis .
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes but to protect our constitutional rights . &quot;
thank you .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 the largest data leak in history was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Papers &quot; reveal that rich and mighty &#93; have hidden &#91; enormous sums of money in tax ha@@ v@@ ens &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness &#93; this week . &#93; this week we were sent by news about a leak of 11 million documents of the Panama @-@ based law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works , as it works . &quot;
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Iceland Prime Minister has res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has let@@ ter@@ box companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; it is said that a track of $ 2 billion to Russian President Vladimir Putin is leading to a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cell@@ ist . &quot;
now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others waiting nerv@@ ously for the next release and on the next uncovered documents .
now it sounds like the plot of an agent artist or a John Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ novel .
&quot; it seems to we@@ ep away from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we do that ?
&quot; but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads . &quot;
and that concerns all of us .
&quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal . &quot;
&quot; in the whole world , media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by some few to hide and disgu@@ ise their assets -- something that we have been discussing and covering for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people seem very conf@@ using this whole world , and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work . &quot;
I always imagine it like a Mat@@ ry@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
&quot; so one has a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what matters . &quot;
I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this issue in the United States .
&quot; probably because there were no prominent Americans , who were present in these revelations , this sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; now , it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; but by the principle , after which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we had a data le@@ ck from the Cay@@ man Islands , or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples of connections to the USA . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in some US states there is less information needed to provide less information to found a company than to get a library card . &quot;
this kind of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to pick up school children .
it has allowed sc@@ amm@@ ers to rip off particularly vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
&quot; our investig@@ ator turned out to be an African minister who wanted to bring suspi@@ cious money to the USA to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
it really shocked us that all except one lawyer made proposals to our investig@@ ator how he could transfer his money .
&quot; none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course no one was given money to anyone . however , it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important not to consider this as an individual case .
it &apos;s not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator .
&quot; it &apos;s not about a single top politi@@ cian , involved in sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; and to handle this , we need to change the rules of the game . &quot;
we need to change the rules to complic@@ ate this kind of behavior .
&quot; this may sound very melanch@@ oly as if we could do nothing against it , as if nothing had ever changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful . &quot;
&quot; but as a borrow@@ ed optim@@ ist , I see that a lot has started to change . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , we have seen incidents of more transparency regarding the owners of companies . &quot;
the theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
&quot; since then , the EU has gathered in central registers on a national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is la@@ gging behind .
&quot; representatives of both parties submitted a bill in both parliam@@ ent@@ arians , but this does not make the progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama expos@@ ures , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure more transparency in the US and globally . &quot;
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who are angry when they see other people hide their true identity behind apparent firms .
we need leaders in the economy who get up and say : &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and are committed to ending this kind of in@@ transparency through laws . &quot;
&quot; together we can finally end the in@@ transparency , which now allows this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot;
this is the story of how I almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das .
&quot; one day after I finished my design studies , I made a back yard sale . &quot;
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my things .
he bought one of my works of art .
&quot; he was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country . after that , he would go to the peace cor@@ ps . &quot;
I invited him on a beer . he excit@@ edly told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I got tired .
&quot; while paying the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot;
he made the whole thing even worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
&quot; and I thought , &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to get ab@@ duc@@ ted in the trunk of a Maz@@ das ! &quot;
this is a small suit@@ case !
then I heard to say : &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room .
&quot; a voice in my head said : &quot; &quot; u@@ h , how please ? &quot;
&quot; at night , I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; Oh , man ! what have I burned ? &quot;
a stranger who sleeps in my living room .
what if he is mad ?
&quot; I got such a fear that I went out of bed , sle@@ e@@ pless on toes to the door , and shut down my bedroom door . &quot;
but he was not mad at all .
we are still in touch .
the artwork he bought from me today hangs in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it completely changed my point of view .
perhaps the people who were sold to me during childhood were friends who were only waiting to be discovered ?
&quot; to accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s take a time leap , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate moves out and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create it to turn fear into fun .
&quot; I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; &quot; Brian , I think about how we could earn something for it . our apartment becomes a designer Bed and Breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , plus a mattress and breakfast each morning . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and created &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors .
they found it great and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese ham O@@ mel@@ ets tasted very different because we made them for our guests .
&quot; we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we said goodbye to our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I star@@ ed at us . &quot;
had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things came rolling .
&quot; my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out if we could make a business concept from it .
&quot; so we presented to investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people publicly post pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms - the kind of rooms whose doors one closes when visiting . &quot;
&quot; over the Internet , they can then invite other people to stay with them . &quot;
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited that the missi@@ le would ign@@ ite .
but they do not .
&quot; no one who is yet in comfort would invest in a business , allowing foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people . &quot;
why ?
because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous .
&quot; if you have a problem , you look at things you can do well . we were able to design . &quot;
&quot; at the Kunst@@ akademie , we learned that design is much more than just appearance and hap@@ tics -- it &apos;s the overall experience . &quot;
&quot; we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who had never met before . &quot;
can design achieve such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a taste of what degree of trust we are striving for .
it &apos;s a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up if you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone .
give your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left seat room@@ mate .
this quiet approach of panic that you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to keep the un@@ locked phone of a stranger in his hands ?
most feel the responsibility .
&quot; in this way , most guests feel like they stay somewhere else . &quot;
only for this reason our company can exist .
&quot; just like that , who is actually Al Gor@@ es &apos;s mobile phone ? &quot;
could you please tell Twitter that he is chann@@ eling for the Office of the President ?
you can return the mobile phones now .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build up . I would like to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail of this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbor had first presented himself with his name ; if he had told , where does he come from , how his dog or his children are called ? &quot;
imagine you would have 150 assessments that all say : &quot; he really can hold very well un@@ locked mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you had to give up your mobile phone ?
a well thought out feedback system strengthens trust decisi@@ vely .
in the beginning we made some things wrong .
it was hard for people to surrender negative jud@@ gements .
&quot; finally , we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had delivered their assessments before we put them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how similar they are regarding age and place of residence .
we trust the most similar to the people who are most similar to us .
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social bias .
it will be exciting when you add a person &apos;s call -- in our case through jud@@ gements .
&quot; if you have less than three convic@@ tions , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but if you have more than ten , everything changes . &quot;
a good reputation encourages com@@ mon@@ alities .
the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
&quot; in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you cost of yourself . &quot;
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if you tell too little , like &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot;
&quot; you tell too much , for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request will not be accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , e.g. &quot; &quot; great works of art in your apartment ! I &apos;m doing holiday with my family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how can design be created to make this degree of openness possible ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text . we also give tips on which topics to write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces against foreigners .
what we did not reck@@ on was the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudi@@ ces .
here you can see how many people claim our offer .
you can see three things .
&quot; first , unbeliev@@ ably good luck . &quot;
second : the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
third : a need that had not been covered before .
&quot; for us , the business is doing very well . &quot;
&quot; of course , there are times when not everything runs smoothly . &quot;
there were guests who have allowed un@@ lawful parties or have devast@@ ated apartments .
hosts have guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the forefront when trust was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts already if I only think of it .
&quot; the disappointment that one hears in the voice of the call@@ ers , was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the 123 million spent over@@ nights only had a fraction of one problem . &quot;
for people rightly trusted in one another .
&quot; if trust works , there can be wonderful things . &quot;
one of our guests made a holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
perfect house for travellers who tend to heart attacks due to sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
&quot; J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels , who save a life even though they don &apos;t know it properly . &quot;
&quot; you drive one in your own car to the hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot;
&quot; because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring books by . &quot;
you can stay even longer without calcul@@ ating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
&quot; of course , not every stay is complete . &quot;
but these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
&quot; when I stum@@ bled upon this term for the first time , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the thought of sharing coinci@@ de with money transactions ?
it is an economic trade .
&quot; but now just call &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; , &quot; the thing is not fair . &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
&quot; people leave a part of themselves open , and that changes everything . &quot;
&quot; when you travel today , you can compare it with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic . &quot;
&quot; what would be , however , if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions ? &quot;
&quot; what if at any place you visit , a group of residents would wait to fill a thoroughly and show one at a pub tour quarter of which you have never heard before ; &quot;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
&quot; nowadays , flats are designed according to the principle of privacy . &quot;
what if we would design apartments from scratch ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would take the thought of shared participation ?
&quot; I imagine cities that enable society and relationships , rather than sol@@ itude and isolation . &quot;
&quot; in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already started . &quot;
were now offered residents . students looking for a place to stay
were medi@@ ated to people whose children were moved out . incub@@ ators were launched ;
&quot; to be able to finance new start @-@ ups in the share economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85@@ ,000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a for@@ eig@@ ner or even host . &quot;
so the idea doesn &apos;t seem to be as crazy as it was taught us .
we have not re@@ invented the wheel .
hospitality has existed before .
there were similar websites before us .
so why did our work just work ?
&quot; apart from happiness and timing , we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust . &quot;
design can help us overcome deep rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I find this amazing
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da drives past me .
&quot; of course , we know that design cannot solve any problem . &quot;
&quot; but if it could help us , if it had this big impact , I wonder why we can use design in the near future . &quot;
thank you .
what do you think when you look at me ?
a believer ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or is it supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ? &quot;
or simply a delay in the airport security check .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t blame you for your negative impressions .
so the media portra@@ y people that look like me .
one study found that 80 % of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that the Americans believe that most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
&quot; for those who have never met a Muslim , it &apos;s great to meet you . &quot;
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra . &quot;
&quot; I am intro@@ ver@@ ted , &quot;
&quot; a fitness @-@ fitness fan@@ atic , &quot;
&quot; and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim . &quot;
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born so . &quot;
I decided to do so .
when I was 17 years old I decided to ou@@ ten .
&quot; no , not as a hom@@ osexual person , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover . &quot;
&quot; my feminist friends were horri@@ fied , &quot; Why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the funny thing was : at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence , in contrast to the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old , to adapt to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal . &quot;
I have not only pas@@ sively accepted the faith of my parents .
I have strug@@ gled with the Qur &apos;an .
&quot; I read it , thought , posed in question , doub@@ ted and ultimately believed . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow dedication that deep@@ ened with every reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of rhythm sometimes brings me to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
&quot; have you ever felt that someone you perceive you fully understands , and yet loves anyway ? &quot;
this is how it feels .
&quot; later I married and started , like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer . &quot;
&quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot; &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had had breakfast in the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; breaking news . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , air@@ planes flew in buildings , people jumped out of the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical mal@@ function ?
my shock quickly changed into rebellion .
why should I do something like that ?
&quot; I changed the television channel and heard : ... &quot; &quot; Muslim terrorists ... , ... &quot; &quot; in the name of Islam ... , ... &quot; &quot; ... jihadi@@ st ... , ... &quot; &quot; bom@@ bed Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; it is not only my country that has been attacked , but in the N@@ u the deeds of others transformed me from a citizen into a susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to drive through the Middle West of the USA to move to a new city and start the post@@ graduate studies . &quot;
&quot; I remember , as I left , as we held silent -- so deep it went down into my seat , and I was the first time I was afraid to be recognized as Muslim . &quot;
&quot; we went to our apartment in this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and when I heard , I saw and read the warnings of the national Islam@@ ist organizations saying , &quot; Be vi@@ gil@@ ant , &quot; &quot; Be watch@@ ful , &quot; &quot; Rem@@ ain in well lighted areas , &quot; do not be sam@@ pled . &quot;
I stayed in the whole week indoors .
then it became Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; warnings : &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot;
I looked at the extensive coverage .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered , and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or people who were held for Muslims to go free and beat them . &quot;
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this land attacked our country .
I have beaten the anger of the people to the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to have to explain oneself constantly .
&quot; I have nothing to ask , I love questions . &quot;
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
today we can actually hear people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims .
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as a tumor in the body of the US .
it only raises the question : are we vi@@ cious or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a malign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumour can only be observed under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is incorrect .
&quot; like all other Americans , Muslims are not a tumor in the US body , but a vital organ . &quot;
thank you !
&quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first @-@ hand and Olympi@@ ans . &quot;
will the closure of mos@@ ques America be more secure ?
&quot; there may be some parking lots , but not stopping the terror . &quot;
&quot; the regular visit of a mosque means to look at people of other fai@@ ths more tolerant , and to show greater civi@@ c participation . &quot;
&quot; and as a director of the police in the Washington DC area , DC recently told : people are actually not radic@@ alized in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radic@@ alized in their cellars or in bed in front of a computer .
&quot; when it comes to the radic@@ alization process , it has been established that it begins online . first , the person is cut off from their community , even from their family , so that the extre@@ mi@@ sts feel that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who abh@@ ors their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or rejected by faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radic@@ alisation , we must stop people to go to the mosque . &quot;
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human , I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
but we would add to their imag@@ inations if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology based on their &quot; holy book . &quot;
&quot; but when one casts a glance at them , it does not force them to read what they read in their &quot; Holy Scriptures . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that allows them to read these things into Scripture .
an outstanding ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she would have joined the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every cl@@ ergy who spoke to them brought them to silence and told her that their anger , their sense of injustice in the world , would only bring them into trouble . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing and something that would have made sense to her anger , she was a major goal for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised her a solution . &quot;
this ima@@ m restored the connection to God and their church .
&quot; instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world . &quot;
she learned what she learned in the mosque to join the IS .
this was an insight into how Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day on our freedom of thought ?
&quot; a study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen . &quot;
&quot; we rather accept an authorit@@ arian system of governance , conformity , and prejudi@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; a study reveals that when people submit news reports , in which neg@@ atively reported about Muslims , they rather have military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an academic problem .
&quot; when you see when the mood sw@@ ings against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two election periods .
&quot; so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror , as I expected . &quot;
&quot; it can indeed be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society , which has rational and well informed citizens . &quot;
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
&quot; we may feel it first , but the toxic air of fear har@@ ms us all . &quot;
&quot; when it comes to assign@@ ing collective guilt , it is not just about having to explain oneself . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
&quot; he was talented at the dental faculty , talented , promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would say that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous man she knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was amazed and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; when has I become such an experienced young man from my brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; only a few weeks after her visit to Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , murdered her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting in the afternoon . &quot;
he shot at De@@ ah eight times .
&quot; fan@@ ati@@ cism can be fatal , not only im@@ moral , but also deadly . &quot;
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mosque or did we stay safe at home ?
&quot; we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about what America we want to leave our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can freely exercise our religion . &quot;
we chose the mosque .
&quot; with our son in the child &apos;s seat , we travelled sil@@ ently , with high pressure to the mosque . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , pulled off my shoes , went into the hall of prayer , and what I saw let me stop . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the congregation was Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us . &quot;
at this moment I have collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had advanced courage and compassion panic and prejudi@@ ces .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe on number ?
or will you join those who think : we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia you seem to have hit a nerve .
&quot; but I wonder what do you say to those who might say that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a mind@@ set with drau@@ ght , working in a clas@@ sy think tank , i.e. an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
&quot; D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t dec@@ eive yourself . I am completely normal . &quot;
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
&quot; when one looks at the Muslims all over the world , and I did that with the greatest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world , people want normal things . &quot;
&quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want to work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
&quot; so , in no way , I am an exception . &quot;
&quot; when people seem like an exception usually appear , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what started as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is shortly before becoming a billi@@ on@@ aire business .
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the potential applications for commercial dr@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; before the air package has penet@@ rated our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the FRA@@ C Centre in France has built a six @-@ metre @-@ high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago , they started to fly with ropes . &quot;
&quot; by connecting , flight devices reach high speed and acceleration in the tigh@@ test space . &quot;
you can also build up @-@ to @-@ yourself resili@@ ent structures .
&quot; they have learned to bear loads , deal with turbul@@ ence and generally respond to natural laws . &quot;
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight .
&quot; in order for a system to work autonom@@ ously , it is necessary to know collectively where the mobile objects are located in the room . &quot;
in our laboratory at the ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
&quot; for today &apos;s demos , we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a publisher of our laboratory . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
&quot; each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine the calculations on board what the machine should do . &quot;
&quot; external commands are available at the highest eb@@ . e. g. &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; land &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; rear starter &quot; , &quot; &quot;
a flight device trying to strike two flies with one flap .
&quot; like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in forward flight , much more efficient as a helicopter in all its variations . &quot;
&quot; unlike most star@@ ters , it can float and has great advantages when starting and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always one down@@ side . &quot;
a limitation of rear @-@ star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence such as wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flight equipment doesn &apos;t matter in what position the optimum position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay . that &apos;s ok .
&quot; during our research , we often ask for fundamental abstract questions which advance to the heart of the matter . &quot;
such a question would be : what is the smallest number of mo@@ ve@@ able parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
&quot; helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand mo@@ ve@@ able parts , which meet to hurt you . &quot;
&quot; decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly remote @-@ controlled flying devices , which had only two movable parts : one prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder . &quot;
&quot; recently , we discovered that flying with just one works . &quot;
&quot; this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically simplest remote @-@ operated flight machine . it was invented recently . &quot;
&quot; it has only one mo@@ ve@@ able part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and th@@ ru@@ sters , no further actu@@ ators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , very much happens inside the inner life so that it can fly stable and move everywhere in the room . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear @-@ star@@ ters . to bring it to flying , I have to throw it exactly right . &quot;
&quot; the probability to throw it right when I see all is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed last night . &quot;
&quot; if the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in cont@@ ent@@ ment , this machine is here , the bus with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ rical .
this is why it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
&quot; in this way , it receives the extraordinary ability , &quot;
&quot; move in space in all directions , no matter what direction it is rot@@ ated or even rot@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers . &quot;
&quot; some things can be seen in models , the rest will be learned directly while flying . &quot;
let &apos;s look at this .
&quot; if planes are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine consists of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller aircraft .
this is clock@@ wise .
and the other against clock@@ wise .
&quot; when you build them together , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; however , if something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller fails , the electronics or a battery - the machine can fly further , though limited . &quot;
we will demonstrate this by making a half air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration uses synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a palette of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we accepted standard micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where space is in the room and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hopefully you are motiv@@ ating these demonstrations to re@@ think of new revolutionary ideas .
&quot; the particularly safe machine , on the other hand , wants to become a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology . &quot;
&quot; for guys like us , wages are in development and creative act . &quot;
&quot; it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures to form them in such spectacular fashion . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
&quot; 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes orbit@@ ed one another in a very far distant gal@@ axy , so the mass of three suns changed in a tenth of a second in pure energy . &quot;
for this short moment they lit more brigh@@ tly than all the stars together in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the entire universe known to us .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but their energy did not set them free in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into the space @-@ time structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us first arrange the events in time .
&quot; 1.3 billion years ago , multi @-@ cell life was created on Earth . &quot;
&quot; since then , the Earth has produced a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God stand up to us -- even the Internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago , a group of especially courageous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver of Cal@@ tech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , which are caused by col@@ li@@ ding black holes . &quot;
most of them considered them crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses so that the US National Science Foundation financed her idea .
&quot; after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Lig@@ o : the laser interfer@@ omet@@ er- gravity @-@ waves @-@ observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; in the following period , the precision of Lig@@ o could be increased considerably , which greatly improved the performance . &quot;
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o now .
at the beginning of September 2015 Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor and persistent problems .
&quot; on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two col@@ li@@ atory black holes dri@@ lled through the earth . &quot;
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the Bir@@ th of My Dau@@ ghter
and the departure from my sick father .
&quot; basically , they were the fruits of my life . &quot;
&quot; AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been studying gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves from black holes and her through observ@@ atories like Lig@@ o meas@@ urable signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves ? &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a cl@@ attering in the structure of space and time .
&quot; when passing the wave , the room and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and st@@ amped into the other . &quot;
&quot; for illustration , lec@@ turers often conduct a properly vocal dance in courses on the theory of rel@@ ativity . &quot;
&quot; stretch and st@@ ow , stretch and st@@ ow . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous . &quot;
&quot; on September 14th , for example , each of us was stretched and st@@ amped when the waves were hit . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; that is 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . &quot;
&quot; with a five @-@ kilometre laser detector , and that is absurd , this length would have to be measured on less than a thous@@ and@@ th of a radius of a nucleus . &quot;
at the end of his classic text about gra@@ vit@@ ation
&quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in building such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot;
&quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive , and with the support of the public all obstacles will be overcome . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne released this 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes claiming that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I want to explain what that means .
&quot; visible light has a wavel@@ ength that is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your cell . &quot;
&quot; this is quite practical , because so you can make a picture or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light coming from several points around you . &quot;
&quot; with tones , that is different . &quot;
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; this is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce an image of things that are particularly important to you : &quot;
for example the face of your child .
&quot; instead we listen to certain properties like pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume , in order to close the story behind it . &quot;
&quot; now just Alice speaks . &quot;
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts them . &quot;
&quot; du@@ mmer Bob , &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot make simple pictures of objects in space with them .
&quot; but by paying attention to changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
&quot; so when we convert wave patterns into sound , we can hear the All literally . &quot;
&quot; listening to the gra@@ vit@@ ation , can tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy for quite a long time . &quot;
&quot; SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , chir@@ ping simple : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
&quot; turn the two bodies very quickly , you hear the same chir@@ p with an additional key signature . that sounds like the &quot; &quot; u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu &quot; &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; it is a kind of movement vocabulary , im@@ printed in the wa@@ ve@@ form . &quot;
&quot; AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Lig@@ o heard : &#91; Sur@@ render noise &#93; Som@@ e@@ one who knows what to listen , this recognizes as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which rotate around as fast as the rods of your mixer . &quot;
AA : let &apos;s consider briefly what that means .
&quot; two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , orbit a hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we have heard it .
therein lies the permanent meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves an entirely new way to explore the universe as it has never been possible before .
on this way we can listen to the All and listen to the un@@ seen .
we can &apos;t see much in space -- practically or fundamentally -- not .
&quot; a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ ghty stars explo@@ de in super @-@ nov@@ as . &quot;
they are very useful . we have learned a lot about space from them .
&quot; but the exciting physical processes happen in the nucleus , which lies hidden behind thousands of kilometres of iron , carbon and silicon . &quot;
we will never see through because these op@@ ak are .
&quot; gravity waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the cosmos , but we will never see it since the Big B@@ ang is covered by its own glimpse . &quot;
using gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
&quot; and the most important thing : I am optimistic that there exist in the universe that we have never seen , which we will never see and of which we have no idea . things that we only discover by listening . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Lig@@ o found things right in the first attempt that we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says on this subject : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , as Lig@@ o watches them , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are , so to speak , the din@@ osau@@ rs for our archaeological work . &quot;
&quot; Lig@@ o gives us a completely different perspective on the events in space , the formation of the stars and ultimately also on how we emerged from this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge is to be as bold as possible .
&quot; thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and chir@@ ping of the universe . &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories - a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be nic@@ er than listening to the Big B@@ ang itself ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; for one year I would say &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; , &quot; in front of which I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; whether it made me nervous , brought me into uncomfortable situations , I forced myself to say &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak in public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to be live on TV ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to start playing ?
&quot; no , no , no , but yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : exactly what I was afraid of , removed my fear . &quot;
&quot; my anxiety to keep talking , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , gone . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; has changed my life .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
&quot; but there was a certain yes that deeply changed my life , to an unexpected style . it began with a question of my smallest . &quot;
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; little kit@@ ten , I need milk for my beak @-@ cup . &quot;
&quot; she asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
this yes was the beginning
&quot; from then on , I swear to always play with them as soon as you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing , or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I am not perfect , but I am very tired . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , my children , to our family . &quot;
&quot; but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently , I fully understood that the &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; to play with my children saved my career . &quot;
I have a real dream job .
I am a writer . I think of things and get you to life .
dream job .
no . no .
I am a titanium .
dream job .
I revol@@ ve television . I produce television .
&quot; I make television , in a large style . &quot;
in this TV season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program into the world .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production . &quot;
each stream offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for one episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
&quot; a new episode every nine days and four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollars television , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three shows simultaneously in production are four , 16 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV , &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
&quot; in America , my TV series are running on Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; all over the world , my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers . &quot;
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts that I have created myself , and not only produced , so on top of it . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to assemble my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fires burning around the world . &quot;
do you know who else does that ?
&quot; no one , therefore I am a titanium . &quot;
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with it .
I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
&quot; I tell you , so that all of you who work so hard , whether you run a company , a country or a classroom , take me seriously when I talk about work , so that you understand that I am not just lying on the computer and f@@ anci@@ ful , and it &apos;s true when I say : I understand that it &apos;s not dre@@ aming about a dream job . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work a lot , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I am immersed in the work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
it &apos;s like I set up troops when I painted on a canvas .
&quot; as a result , you have a high sound , deliver a marathon . &quot;
it feels like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love working .
&quot; she is creative , mechan@@ ically , exhau@@ sting and intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and sensible . and the best thing about it is the sum . &quot;
there is such a change in me when work goes well .
&quot; a bu@@ zz begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz@@ ing sounds like a busy road , I could always drive on it . &quot;
many people assume when I declare to them the sums that I &apos;m talking about writing that writing is joy .
&quot; don &apos;t understand me wrong , it does . &quot;
&quot; but the sum -- when I started with television production , when I started working and working , building , creating and working together , I discovered this thing , this sum , this energy . &quot;
the sum is more than writing .
the sum is action and activity . the sum is a drug .
the bu@@ zz is music . the bu@@ zz is light and air .
the sum is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a bu@@ zz , then you can &apos;t look different to size . &quot;
&quot; the feeling of not being different than striving for size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called the sum .
or perhaps it also means being a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it is called genius .
perhaps it is ego .
perhaps it is the fear of the failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; I know only that I am not made for failure , and I only know that I love the sum . &quot;
&quot; I just want to tell you , I am a titanium and I know that I don &apos;t want to question it . &quot;
&quot; to make one thing clear : the more successful I become , the more episodes , the more episodes , the more work there is , the more work there is , the more I write history , the more expectations there is . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more I must work . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; the land I created , the marathon which I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound , the sum , the sum , the sum . &quot;
I like this sum . I love the bu@@ zz .
I need the sum . I am the sum .
am I just this sum ?
and then the sw@@ um stopped .
&quot; over@@ hau@@ led , over@@ loaded , over@@ done , burnt out . &quot;
the bu@@ zz stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mo@@ m is a single working institute .
&quot; Har@@ per tells people , &quot; My m@@ um will not be there , but you can write to my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; little kit@@ ten , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da country . &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ an .
they are baby Tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sum ceased . &quot;
the sum of the engine was silent .
I didn &apos;t love my work any more . the engine was off .
the sum did not come back .
my bu@@ zz was broken .
&quot; I made the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours days , worked weekends , no regret , nothing deleg@@ ating , a titanium does not sleep , doesn &apos;t give up , with all your heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no bu@@ zz .
in me was silence .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
&quot; I was a pre @-@ emin@@ ent Titan , &quot;
&quot; everything was grey , I just had no fun anymore . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the bu@@ zz@@ ing and the sum was me .
&quot; so what do you do when what you do , the work you love , suddenly fade away ? &quot;
&quot; I know some may think : &quot; present thyself , stupid author @-@ titanium . &quot;
&quot; but you know you do it , you do it , you &apos;re working , you love what you &apos;re doing , a teacher , a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love another and that gives one the sum if you knew the sum , who is one then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; if the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ? &quot;
and then my &quot; southern servant wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; asks me a question .
&quot; I &apos;m out on the way out , late on it and she says , &quot; M@@ om , do you like playing ? &quot;
and I want to say no when two things become aware of me :
&quot; first , I have to say yes to all and secondly , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; &quot; babies &quot; . &quot; &quot;
she doesn &apos;t call anyone any more .
when did this happen ?
&quot; I miss it when I am Titan and my tot@@ um smo@@ other , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; M@@ um , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about it .
&quot; we play and her sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of bu@@ oy@@ ancy , I can &apos;t do anything except to watch out . &quot;
I am focused .
I am silent .
&quot; the country I created , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; everything that exists are sti@@ cky finger and wet kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax al@@ pen@@ cils and the song in which it &apos;s about letting go , or whatever the girl is releasing into &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot; &quot;
everywhere peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so tight that I can barely breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ solves .
a mental door enters and an energy boost comes in .
&quot; and that &apos;s not immediately , but it happens , it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the bu@@ zz is slowly coming back .
&quot; no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there . &quot;
&quot; not the bu@@ zz@@ ing , but a bu@@ zz . &quot;
and now I feel as if I know a magic mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
&quot; the sums , the working sums , the titan@@ ic sums , that &apos;s only the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , when I describe myself with the help of shows and TV hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real bu@@ zz is . &quot;
the sum is not a force and it is not work @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real bu@@ zz depends on love .
the sum is the current coming from the lust of life .
the real bu@@ zz is self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; real sums ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be completed , the expectation and the pressure . &quot;
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
&quot; the real sum is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered to me the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ? &quot;
it is just love .
&quot; we all need a bit more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
&quot; I do this as a rule , so I can free myself from any guilt as a work@@ ah@@ olic . &quot;
&quot; it is Law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice if I want to hear the sums again . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so simple . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
&quot; playing is not a way to play , how do you work . &quot;
&quot; the truth hur@@ ts , &quot;
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer working at the workplace than at home .
&quot; this admission is painful , because what a person prefers to work than to be home ? &quot;
&quot; well , I . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; -- &quot;
I have to have problems .
none of it is that I am too relaxed .
&quot; we rage around in the garden , back and forth , back and forth . &quot;
&quot; we make small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bubbles .
&quot; I feel mainly stiff , absent , and confused . &quot;
I always grab my cell phone .
but it is ok .
my children show me how to live and the universe of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing games ?
you can also do it ! always tell Yes if your child wants to play with you .
&quot; perhaps you consider me nai@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; you are right , but you can do it too ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something different .
&quot; it &apos;s wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bird or bis@@ cuit replaces me .
&quot; and talks my teen @-@ daughter whole 15 minutes with me , I am mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; it is only 15 minutes , more needs it not . &quot;
&quot; everyone can bring up 15 minutes a piece , even on a bad mood @-@ day ! &quot;
15 minutes a bit !
&quot; no mobile phone , no laundry , no distra@@ ction . &quot;
&quot; the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to go . &quot;
but 15 minutes are in it !
&quot; my children are my well @-@ being , my world . it must not be the children . it is important to feel the hum@@ ming , to have a place for peace of mind . &quot;
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about pleasure
&quot; to play &quot; &quot; games &quot; &quot; in general . &quot;
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find out and keep it .
&quot; friends meet , read books , enjoy the day -- &quot;
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; is short for everything I have given up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in the training , when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot;
15 minutes of play - why not treat yourself full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sum came back in my free time . the bu@@ zz then seems to return if I do not work .
working does not work without games .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul . &quot;
&quot; I like the sum , but I don &apos;t love it . &quot;
I don &apos;t need it .
&quot; I am not the sum , the sum is not me ... no more . &quot;
&quot; soap bubbles and sti@@ cky finger , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is my sum .
the sums of life .
the sums of love .
&quot; the sum of the work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so thank@@ ful for that . &quot;
&quot; I have never seen a Titan , the journey to Jerusalem . &quot;
I said yes to less work and to play more .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still working . my camp@@ fire is still burning .
&quot; the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children are . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more clear my head is . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the sum . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this sum , the more this unusual , lasting , naked and new feeling of being is spread in me . less titanium -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this sum , the more I know who I am . &quot;
I am a writer . I think of things I get you to life .
&quot; this is part of the job , which means living his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
for a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; I said &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; to less work and to play more . &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am neuro@@ surgeon .
&quot; like most of my colleagues , I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies . &quot;
I know how your life can change from one second to another after a severe stroke or a car accident .
&quot; for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability . &quot;
this is probably the reason why I became functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical measures .
&quot; they certainly have one of the most well @-@ known , known as &quot; &quot; deep @-@ brain stimulation &quot; . &quot; in doing so , an electrode immer@@ ses deep in the brain in order to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons so that the neuro@@ logical function is improved . &quot;
it is truly an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease who suffered from severe trem@@ ors and severe pain .
&quot; neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ cure . &quot;
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close .
with some help the brain can help itself .
history started 15 years ago .
&quot; at that time I was a senior doctor , working day and night in the emergency room . &quot;
often I provided patients with skull @-@ brain trauma .
&quot; you have to imagine , that the brain har@@ ms the brain and increases the internal pressure of the skull . &quot;
&quot; in order to save life , you have to reduce the pressure of the skull . &quot;
&quot; for this , one sometimes needs to remove a portion of s@@ wollen brain mass . &quot;
&quot; instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist . &quot;
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
to let cells grow from one piece of tissue is comparable to very small children extracted from your families .
&quot; you have to find the right nutrition , temperature , humidity and the surroundings to thri@@ ve . &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
&quot; after many attempts , Jean @-@ François managed to do so . &quot;
he saw this under his microscope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells . &quot;
&quot; perhaps you know from biology classes that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells , which can turn into any cell type of the organism . &quot;
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to obtain this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operation .
we did another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die ; they are immort@@ al .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they split slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently . &quot;
we needed long to understand where they came from .
they originate from these cells .
these blue and red cells hot Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex cells .
you play a very important role in our development .
at the stage of the fet@@ us they care for the folding of the brain .
but why do they get us ?
we don &apos;t know that .
&quot; we believe that they take part in the healing of the brain , as we find it at higher concentrations close to brain injuries . &quot;
but this is not so sure .
but one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells .
we are facing a potential cell source that allows brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
&quot; we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ linguistic area , and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did . &quot;
and then color them in color to be able to follow them in the brain .
&quot; in the last step , we took them to the acceptance test of the same individual . &quot;
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ tation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we have these cells in normal brain tissue and what will happen if we have the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ il@@ ler we were able to work with monkeys .
&quot; in the first scenario we checked the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were removed again , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they are not used there , so they disappear . &quot;
&quot; in the second scenario , we inflic@@ ted an injury and they had exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons . &quot;
here you see what we were able to observe under the microscope .
these are the cells that have been re @-@ chlor@@ inated .
&quot; the evidence they show are these little d@@ ots . these are the cells that we dy@@ e in vitro , in culture . &quot;
&quot; of course , we could not stop here . &quot;
will these cells help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take pellets from a tray .
they made it very good .
&quot; when they reached a stable skill level , we injured the motor motor sector in the motor cor@@ tex . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they couldn &apos;t move their hand any more . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen in humans , they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree , just like after a stroke . &quot;
the patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree as well as with the monkey .
&quot; when we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells . &quot;
on the left you can see the monkey that spontaneously recovered .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from injury .
he is not so precise and not so fast .
&quot; now , when we left the cells , the same monkey , two months after the rice plant@@ ation . &quot;
I can tell you that were very exciting results for us too .
since that time we have found out much more about these cells .
we can freeze them and use them later .
&quot; we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
but our dream is still to implant them in humans .
I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
&quot; Fr . Giussani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that right now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can need it . &quot;
I definitely .
&quot; of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials on humans . &quot;
&quot; J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results , one has to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms in order to pass through these kinds of studies . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , and so on . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and have tried to get permission to start the clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes to go to hospital , and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
&quot; first of all , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial . &quot;
will the authorities permit us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select patients to perform the treatments and assess whether it is useful to do this kind of treatment .
then you have to apply it to a multi @-@ centric study .
first you have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
&quot; BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course . &quot;
&quot; BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne , thank you for your visit to TED and that you told us about it . &quot;
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as self @-@ evident .
&quot; we see democracy not as the fragile plant it actually is , but as an inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to consider them as imm@@ utable in@@ firm@@ ity .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
&quot; Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a flour@@ ishing capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; in fact , democracy winds up with us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- I was un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally clear to me as finance minister in the Euro@@ group , that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- will not affect the austerity programs that have been realized in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at that moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my sincere friends who told me repeatedly that democracy would be abol@@ ished if it would change anything . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy . &quot;
&quot; I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China , and even the Euro@@ group of mis@@ belief , could save us democracy , but that we need a tru@@ thful and def@@ en@@ sible democracy . &quot;
&quot; for without democracy our societies are bl@@ amed , our future glo@@ omy and our great , new technologies wasted . &quot;
&quot; on the topic of waste , I would like to point out to an interesting contradiction that currently threat@@ ens our economies . &quot;
&quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; twin summit parad@@ ox &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a top is known to you . you know and recognize him as the mountain of debt , which th@@ rows his long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all recognize the mountain of debt , &quot;
but few recognize its twin .
&quot; a mountain of unused cash , which belongs to the wealthy savers and corporations , who are too anxious to invest in it , where it would be productive and income with which one could produce the mountain of debt , and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; over the past three months , 3,@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars have been invested in the United States , England and the euro area , in all the wealth producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so forth . &quot;
&quot; $ 3.@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion US Dollar sounds like a lot of money , until you compare it with the 5.@@ 1 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars , which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and did absolutely nothing except to infl@@ ate the stock markets and raise real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin summ@@ its , which are not offset by the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 year olds in the United States , Japan and Europe unemployed , and consequently a low aggregate demand which , as in a continuous loop , encourages the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors that would be true that his son would kill him if he is grown up , &quot;
in@@ adver@@ t@@ ently causes the circumstances causing ec@@ edi@@ pus to kill him .
that is my hair with capitalism --
&quot; all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents , and especially to finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the Earth . &quot;
is democracy the solution ?
but before we proceed : what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the Free and the poor as majority control the government .
&quot; the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy , of course , closed too many -- &quot;
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy due to these degrees . &quot;
&quot; the decisive factor in the democracy of Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that she gave up the working arms , and gave them not only the right to freedom of speech but also more important and decisive , which they grant to them the right to political co @-@ determination with the same mood in questions of the State of State . &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy hasn &apos;t kept for a long time --
&quot; like a candle that shines brigh@@ tly , it is burned out quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , our modern liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies did not have their roots in ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a statute for rulers . &quot;
&quot; the liberal democracy first appeared when a complete separation between politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- so the world of corporations - became a more democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in our present demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle took place between the two , while the economy slowly under@@ mined the politics and dis@@ ma@@ yed them . &quot;
are you wondering why the politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not due to a degeneration of its DNA .
&quot; it is because the government can now be in the government and still not in power , because the power is immig@@ rated from politics into the economy and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my hair with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it is like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es that sustain@@ ably dec@@ im@@ ated the animals that they feed on , that they are star@@ ving at the end . &quot;
&quot; the power of corporations is growing , political goods are de@@ valued , political goods are de@@ valued , the general economic demand falls , and the general managers of corporations are too sc@@ ared to invest in the cash of their companies . &quot;
&quot; the more successful capitalism distri@@ butes the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; from democracy , the higher the twin summ@@ its , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity . &quot;
&quot; if that is true , it is obvious that we have to bring together politics and the economy again , and it would be better if the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; keeps control , just as in ancient Athens , aside from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
&quot; by the way , this is not a new idea . &quot;
the Marxist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it was not very good .
the doctrine of the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only regain their position as in ancient Athens without creating new ways of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is one solution : the working poor abol@@ ish !
capitalism does it by replacing low wage workers through automation and robots .
&quot; the problem is , as long as economics and politics are separate areas , the automation makes the twin peaks higher , the waste becomes more sub@@ lime , and the social conflicts deeper , as it is -- very soon , as I believe -- in countries like China . &quot;
&quot; so we have to re@@ design the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and make sure that we democr@@ ati@@ ze the re@@ united area , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cracy that makes the film &quot; Matrix &quot; appear as a documentation . &quot;
so the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that he has produced .
&quot; the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to that in &quot; matrix , &quot; or by something that the society in &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; resembles in which machines serve people and people indulge their energy in the exploration of the universe , or to indulge in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long discussions the meaning of life . &quot;
I think we must be optimistic .
so what would it be like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; like D@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples , in a nut@@ shell . &quot;
&quot; in the area of companies : please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from one job to another , from a company to the next , and the company -- no matter where you are working -- is property of those who currently work in the company . &quot;
&quot; then all income comes from capital and proceeds , and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
&quot; there is no differentiation between those who belong to the enterprises , who do not work in it , and employees who work there , but not belong to the company . no more exchange between capital and labour , no big gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no up@@ lifting twin peaks . &quot;
&quot; in the sphere of global political economy : please introduce briefly that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate in a universal , global , digital currency , issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; in the interests of the whole of mankind . &quot;
&quot; imagine that the world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the Cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund is investing in green technology , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed at Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
&quot; today , we have them , especially against the background of a re @-@ united politics and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world I describe to you is simultaneously liber@@ ating , in which they prefer privileged persons , and Mar@@ xi@@ an because they will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the tr@@ ash of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , globally key@@ nes@@ ian . &quot;
&quot; but above all , it is a world in which we can imagine real democracy . &quot;
we will wake up in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better democratic .
thank you .
Bruno Giussani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography as the liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we not do this , technological developments will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers said as &quot; &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; by transferring this crisis from one part of the world to the next , as we are currently experiencing , it will not only dest@@ abil@@ ise our demo@@ cra@@ cies but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is true , then Marx is quite relevant , &quot;
&quot; like Ha@@ ye@@ k , that is why I am a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and therefore I am completely s@@ wir@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; BG : indeed , and now we are . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said that . BG : in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at supp@@ er the speakers you have said very clearly what you think of the West &apos;s point of view on China . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the appearance of democracy .
&quot; as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy on politics , while the area where most plays out -- the area of economics -- is a completely democratic area . &quot;
&quot; in a certain sense , if I may say that pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar today to the England of the 19th century . &quot;
for -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is an error historically regarded .
&quot; liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill -- &quot;
he was particularly scep@@ tical concerning the democratic development .
&quot; what we can observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , particularly the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; now to blame China now to do what the West did in the 19th century itself , smells enormous after hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I sen@@ sed that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later for the first half of the year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing , as we had the opportunity to make a new start with the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; to say good @-@ bye to the self @-@ compl@@ ac@@ ency , and the continual denial that a massive fault line went through the Eurozone , and continues , which massi@@ vely threat@@ ens the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first suggestion that revealed this denial -- &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the European Union , have continued to adopt the denial . &quot;
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; if you try to get an economic system that is not viable , by political will and authorit@@ ari@@ anism , you might be able to delay it for a while , but when the changes occur , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive . &quot;
BG : what changes do you fores@@ ee ?
&quot; Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future , if we do not change its structure . &quot;
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Ernst ...
&quot; if there is a Minister of Finance , or any Minister who is in office after 6 months , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he claims that he has made no mistake , then this is a dangerous person . &quot;
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the motion for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the sides of the don@@ or to find a common solution .
but there was no such thing .
&quot; they just wanted to bring our government down , just because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions going through the euro@@ zone . &quot;
they didn &apos;t want to admit that they had been a disa@@ strous program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
this is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; none of the len@@ ders of the credi@@ tors imposed on us by this policy stood up : &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal error . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all that , and despite the aggressive tone of the talks , you seem to be still quite pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe .
my biggest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive .
&quot; for if it does not survive , the shared centri@@ fu@@ ges will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not have disa@@ strous consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire world economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; if we allow ourselves to adopt the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 what it appears to me , it will be equally int@@ ol@@ erable for the future of Europeans as well as non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope that you will be wrong at this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you for being with TED . &quot;
Y@@ V : thank you .
&quot; Roy Price has never heard most of them , although he probably is responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 . &quot;
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for very many of you .
this goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is senior employee at Amazon Studios
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has an I@@ gel@@ fr@@ is@@ ur and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; Mo@@ vies , TV , Techni@@ que , Tac@@ os . &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for choosing the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
&quot; of course , this is a very hard fought industry . &quot;
there are so many TV shows that Roy can &apos;t choose any .
&quot; he has to find shows , which are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he has to find shows that are located quite right on this corner . &quot;
this curve is the valuation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the website IM@@ DB . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review is received .
&quot; will your show be judged with nine and higher , this is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; - all the shows that are addic@@ tive where , after watching a relay , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left side , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price is not worried about getting to the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to under@@ mine &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he has more thoughts about the medium payout , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t exc@@ ite . &quot;
so he must ensure that he is really on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is present , and of course it &apos;s the first time Amazon is doing something , so Roy Price wants nothing to risk . &quot;
he wants to create successes .
&quot; he needs a guaranteed success , so he holds a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online , where they can watch for free . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon releases things for free , you &apos;re going to get right ? &quot;
millions of viewers watch these episodes .
&quot; however , they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows . &quot;
you are watched by Roy and his team who are recording everything .
&quot; you record when you start the show , when you pause , which parts you ski@@ ps or look again . &quot;
they collect millions of data in order to determine which show they should produce with these data .
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them , and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com via four republi@@ can American sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t that good . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7,@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- i.e. slightly above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; about the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find it a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it something different . &quot;
&quot; instead of hosting a competition , he and his team have looked at the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews they give the shows , their course , what shows they like etc . &quot;
&quot; then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , which producers , which actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the parts together , they entered a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com over four Sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; &quot; House of Cards &quot; . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x thus landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 review on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
&quot; of course , the question is : what happened here ? &quot;
&quot; there are two very competitive , data @-@ sealed companies . &quot;
&quot; they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company . &quot;
what is this ?
because logic somehow says that it should work with everything .
&quot; if you collect millions of data , for a decision you meet , you should make a good decision . &quot;
you have 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
it optimi@@ zes it with very powerful computers .
&quot; what you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis does not work , then this is a bit frigh@@ tening because we live in a time in which we reach more and more to statistics to make serious choices , far beyond television . &quot;
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems here ?
&quot; no one . OK , that &apos;s even good . &quot;
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one in this room will ever come into contact with this software . come into contact with it you are in prison .
&quot; if someone is in jail here in the U.S. and asks for dis@@ mis@@ sal , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine if there is a dis@@ mis@@ sal or not . &quot;
&quot; just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it is decided whether a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; moderate TV , 22 minutes , this can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
not always the best results are produced . that &apos;s not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
the data of the most experienced companies is also wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that it could predict out@@ breaks from flu , the bad way -- by analyzing data from Google &apos;s research . &quot;
it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked fine , year by year , until it suddenly stopped functioning , &quot;
and nobody could say why .
&quot; it simply did not work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data experienced companies like Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; despite all these errors , data streams into decisions of life -- at work , in law enforcement , in medicine . &quot;
so we should better make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ aided genetics -- an area where some very smart people use uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able many data to make serious choices as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years I have recognized some patterns regarding the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
&quot; if you have to solve a complex problem , do two things : &quot;
&quot; first disman@@ tle this problem into its parts , so that you can analyze the individual components ; as a second , put the individual parts together again in order to make a decision . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again . &quot;
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool and we all possess it : our brain .
&quot; if there is something in which the brain is good , it is necessary to put parts and pieces together again , even if the information is incomplete , in order to make a good decision - especially if it is the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I think , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and minds where they also belong in the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their audience , what else they wouldn &apos;t have been able to do . but the decision on how to take all these parts and make a show like &quot; House of Cards , &quot; was not in the data . &quot;
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team made this decision for this show which meant that they had a great personal risk with this decision .
&quot; Amazon however , did this in the wrong way . &quot;
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first as they competing for TV ideas , then selecting &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show . &quot;
&quot; it was a safe decision , because they could always say , &quot; &quot; This is the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data is helpful for better decisions , but I think things go wrong when data start to ste@@ er our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and to not forget this , this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will ...
&quot; before there was data , this was the device for decision making . &quot;
many know it .
&quot; it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a ja@@ - or no @-@ question , you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- right here at this moment . &quot;
I will challenge it later with a technical demo .
&quot; so far I have made some decisions in my life , whereby I should have listened to the ball afterwards . &quot;
&quot; but , as you naturally know when you have the data available , you want to replace it with a much more elaborate , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the basic structure .
&quot; in the end , it is up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data it still pays off to make decisions , to be an expert in what you are doing and risks . &quot;
&quot; in the end , it is not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thank you very much .
