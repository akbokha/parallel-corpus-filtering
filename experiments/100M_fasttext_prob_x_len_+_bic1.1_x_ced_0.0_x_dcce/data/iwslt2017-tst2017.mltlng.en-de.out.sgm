<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before someone heard from Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacular that the NSA illegally heard telephones of Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in this, he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation in which the CIA transferred literally drafts for a nuclear bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if that sounds crazy, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who didn't like the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for almost 10 years, the government has determined against crises and asked him to call his alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this turn, he became a symbol of the government's pattern to condemn whistleblowers and spy on journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the First Constitution, the media has the right to publish secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"but it is impossible to apply this right, if media do not receive this information, and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous ones they reveal."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government knocked at Risen, he did something that many brave reporters did before him: he refused and said he would rather go to jail."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen was living with the risk of being imprisoned."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, even though they had argued for years that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government have been dropped."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring the reporters and sources can always hide less.</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of failing and giving rise to statements, this could also carry out his digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so the investigators, without his consent, kept his phone-proof secret,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"just like its e-mail data, financial and bank information, its credit facility, and even a number of impulses with the list of its flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA Whistleblower and Risens supposedly Source."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama promised to protect whistleblowers in his attempt to protect whistleblowers, but instead the judiciary has condemned him more than all US governments in front of him."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of its work as a secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, almost every article about national security has been the result of whistleblowers going to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional review, because the government has more and more possibilities to splash out all."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just as the government's technology allows revising the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and indeed, they can take this from the moment they contact, rather than in hindsight, in the witness stand."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today, there is communication software that has not yet existed when Risen has written his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such technology is SecureDrop, an open-source transmission system for whistle-blowers, originally developed by the Internet-famous Aaron Swartz, and is today developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation where I work."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an email, go to a news website, such as the Washington Post."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can upload documents or send information, just like with any ordinary contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">"these are then encrypted and stored on a server, to which only the respective news agency access has access."</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government cannot obtain more information in secret, and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset."</seg>
<seg id="36">"SecureDrop is, however, only a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century."</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new spionage technologies that threaten us all."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is important to us to ensure that not only technology dividers, such as Edward Snowden, have a possibility to commit wrongdoing. it is equally important that we protect the next whistle-blowers,"</seg>
<seg id="39">Or to report about grievances in the supply of soldiers and report about crowded hospitals. or the next environmental employee who suggests the alarm for polluted water from Flint. or a wallstreet insider that warns us about the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes but to protect our constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016 the largest data leak in history was published.] [the "Panama Papers" reveal that rich and mighty] have hidden [enormous sums of money in tax havens] [what does that mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness] this week.] this week we were sent by news about a leak of 11 million documents of the Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies like Mossack Fonseca and say:" okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this? "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works, as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland Prime Minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has letterbox companies in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is said that a track of $2 billion to Russian President Vladimir Putin is leading to a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist."</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others waiting nervously for the next release and on the next uncovered documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the plot of an agent artist or a John Grisham-novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems to weep away from you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do that?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads."</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"in the whole world, media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax havens are used by some few to hide and disguise their assets -- something that we have been discussing and covering for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people seem very confusing this whole world, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a Matryjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so one has a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what matters."</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this issue in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="63">"probably because there were no prominent Americans, who were present in these revelations, this scandal."</seg>
<seg id="64">"now, it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their wealth in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="65">"but by the principle, after which these tax havens work, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we had a data leck from the Cayman Islands, or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples of connections to the USA."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, in some US states there is less information needed to provide less information to found a company than to get a library card."</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to pick up school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed scammers to rip off particularly vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigator turned out to be an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the USA to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">It really shocked us that all except one lawyer made proposals to our investigator how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">"none of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course no one was given money to anyone. however, it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as an individual case.</seg>
<seg id="78">It's not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our covert investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">"it's not about a single top politician, involved in scandal."</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and to handle this, we need to change the rules of the game."</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to complicate this kind of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">"this may sound very melancholy as if we could do nothing against it, as if nothing had ever changed; as if there will always be the rich and powerful."</seg>
<seg id="84">"but as a borrowed optimist, I see that a lot has started to change."</seg>
<seg id="85">"over the past few years, we have seen incidents of more transparency regarding the owners of companies."</seg>
<seg id="86">The theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU has gathered in central registers on a national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties submitted a bill in both parliamentarians, but this does not make the progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how these Panama exposures, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure more transparency in the US and globally."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are angry when they see other people hide their true identity behind apparent firms.</seg>
<seg id="93">We need leaders in the economy who get up and say: "transparency is not good for business."</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and are committed to ending this kind of intransparency through laws."</seg>
<seg id="95">"together we can finally end the intransparency, which now allows this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story of how I almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">"one day after I finished my design studies, I made a back yard sale."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my things.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">"he was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country. after that, he would go to the peace corps."</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him on a beer. he excitedly told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I got tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"while paying the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "where do you sleep tonight?"</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing even worse: "I don't know yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought," Oh, man! "</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just got to know him! he says he would go to peace corps, but I don't know if he really plans it. I don't want to get abducted in the trunk of a Mazdas!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small suitcase!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard to say: "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="112">"a voice in my head said:" "uh, how please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night, I was lying in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought," Oh, man! what have I burned? "</seg>
<seg id="114">A stranger who sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is mad?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such a fear that I went out of bed, sleepless on toes to the door, and shut down my bedroom door."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not mad at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork he bought from me today hangs in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it completely changed my point of view.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me during childhood were friends who were only waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">"to accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress."</seg>
<seg id="123">"let's take a time leap, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I'm unemployed, almost broke, my roommate moves out and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create it to turn fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky:" "Brian, I think about how we could earn something for it. our apartment becomes a designer Bed and Breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk included, plus a mattress and breakfast each morning."</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and created "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese ham Omelets tasted very different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we toured with them through the whole city. when we said goodbye to our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I stared at us."</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if we could make a business concept from it.</seg>
<seg id="138">"so we presented to investors:" we want to create a website where people publicly post pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms - the kind of rooms whose doors one closes when visiting. "</seg>
<seg id="139">"over the Internet, they can then invite other people to stay with them."</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the missile would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">"no one who is yet in comfort would invest in a business, allowing foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if you have a problem, you look at things you can do well. we were able to design."</seg>
<seg id="147">"at the Kunstakademie, we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it's the overall experience."</seg>
<seg id="148">"we had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, between people who had never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design achieve such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a taste of what degree of trust we are striving for.</seg>
<seg id="152">It's a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up if you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your unlocked mobile phone to your left seat roommate.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet approach of panic that you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">The only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the unlocked phone of a stranger in his hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">"in this way, most guests feel like they stay somewhere else."</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">"just like that, who is actually Al Gores's mobile phone?"</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please tell Twitter that he is channeling for the Office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can return the mobile phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build up. I would like to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail of this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbor had first presented himself with his name; if he had told, where does he come from, how his dog or his children are called?"</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 assessments that all say: "he really can hold very well unlocked mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to give up your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">A well thought out feedback system strengthens trust decisively.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to surrender negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">"finally, we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had delivered their assessments before we put them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how similar they are regarding age and place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">We trust the most similar to the people who are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting when you add a person's call -- in our case through judgements.</seg>
<seg id="182">"if you have less than three convictions, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but if you have more than ten, everything changes."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation encourages commonalities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">"in addition, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you cost of yourself."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if you tell too little, like" Hi!, "you don't get an answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"you tell too much, for example:" I have problems with my mother "-- -- the request will not be accepted."</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g." "great works of art in your apartment! I'm doing holiday with my family." ""</seg>
<seg id="191">How can design be created to make this degree of openness possible?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text. we also give tips on which topics to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices against foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not reckon was the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people claim our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">"first, unbelievably good luck."</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a need that had not been covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">"for us, the business is doing very well."</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are times when not everything runs smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have allowed unlawful parties or have devastated apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the forefront when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts already if I only think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">"the disappointment that one hears in the voice of the callers, was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve."</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, the 123 million spent overnights only had a fraction of one problem."</seg>
<seg id="209">For people rightly trusted in one another.</seg>
<seg id="210">"if trust works, there can be wonderful things."</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made a holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">Perfect house for travellers who tend to heart attacks due to sitting activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">"Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels, who save a life even though they don't know it properly."</seg>
<seg id="218">"you drive one in your own car to the hospital, when you die, and wait while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books by."</seg>
<seg id="220">You can stay even longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">"of course, not every stay is complete."</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I stumbled upon this term for the first time, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the thought of sharing coincide with money transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but now just call" "rental industry", "the thing is not fair."</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">"people leave a part of themselves open, and that changes everything."</seg>
<seg id="230">"when you travel today, you can compare it with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">"what would be, however, if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions?"</seg>
<seg id="232">"what if at any place you visit, a group of residents would wait to fill a thoroughly and show one at a pub tour quarter of which you have never heard before;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">"nowadays, flats are designed according to the principle of privacy."</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would design apartments from scratch?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would take the thought of shared participation?</seg>
<seg id="238">"I imagine cities that enable society and relationships, rather than solitude and isolation."</seg>
<seg id="239">"in South Korea's capital Seoul, this project has already started."</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered residents. students looking for a place to stay</seg>
<seg id="241">Were mediated to people whose children were moved out. incubators were launched;</seg>
<seg id="242">"to be able to finance new start-ups in the share economy. over our platform alone, 785,000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a foreigner or even host."</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea doesn't seem to be as crazy as it was taught us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We have not reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality has existed before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work just work?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from happiness and timing, we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find this amazing</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda drives past me.</seg>
<seg id="253">"of course, we know that design cannot solve any problem."</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us, if it had this big impact, I wonder why we can use design in the near future."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"or is it suppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the airport security check.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't blame you for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media portray people that look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">One study found that 80% of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show that the Americans believe that most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">"for those who have never met a Muslim, it's great to meet you."</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">"I am introverted,"</seg>
<seg id="271">"a fitness-fitness fanatic,"</seg>
<seg id="272">"and I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born so."</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old I decided to outen.</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to wear Hijab, my head cover."</seg>
<seg id="277">"my feminist friends were horrified," Why do you suppress yourself? "</seg>
<seg id="278">"the funny thing was: at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence, in contrast to the pressure I felt as 17-year-old, to adapt to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only passively accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have struggled with the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, thought, posed in question, doubted and ultimately believed."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was trust and slow dedication that deepened with every reading of the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of rhythm sometimes brings me to tears.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">"have you ever felt that someone you perceive you fully understands, and yet loves anyway?"</seg>
<seg id="287">This is how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">"later I married and started, like all the good Egyptians, my career as an engineer."</seg>
<seg id="289">"later, after my marriage, I had a child, and basically lived the" Egyptian-American Dream. ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came that terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I sat in my kitchen, had had breakfast in the end, looked at the screen and saw the word" "breaking news." ""</seg>
<seg id="293">"there was smoke, airplanes flew in buildings, people jumped out of the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical malfunction?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock quickly changed into rebellion.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should I do something like that?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I changed the television channel and heard:..." "Muslim terrorists...,..." "in the name of Islam...,..." "... jihadist...,..." "bombed Mecca!"</seg>
<seg id="300">"Oh, my God."</seg>
<seg id="301">"it is not only my country that has been attacked, but in the Nu the deeds of others transformed me from a citizen into a suspects."</seg>
<seg id="302">"on the same day, we had to drive through the Middle West of the USA to move to a new city and start the postgraduate studies."</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember, as I left, as we held silent -- so deep it went down into my seat, and I was the first time I was afraid to be recognized as Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="304">"we went to our apartment in this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"and when I heard, I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamist organizations saying," Be vigilant, "" Be watchful, "" Remain in well lighted areas, "do not be sampled."</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed in the whole week indoors.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it became Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"warnings:" do not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal. "</seg>
<seg id="309">I looked at the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were understandably unfiltered, and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or people who were held for Muslims to go free and beat them."</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked this land attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have beaten the anger of the people to the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to have to explain oneself constantly.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I have nothing to ask, I love questions."</seg>
<seg id="319">It is the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Today we can actually hear people say: "there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we get rid of them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church as a tumor in the body of the US.</seg>
<seg id="324">It only raises the question: are we vicious or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumor is removed as a whole and a benign tumour can only be observed under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is incorrect.</seg>
<seg id="327">"like all other Americans, Muslims are not a tumor in the US body, but a vital organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">"Muslims are inventors and teachers, first-hand and Olympians."</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques America be more secure?</seg>
<seg id="331">"there may be some parking lots, but not stopping the terror."</seg>
<seg id="332">"the regular visit of a mosque means to look at people of other faiths more tolerant, and to show greater civic participation."</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as a director of the police in the Washington DC area, DC recently told: people are actually not radicalized in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalized in their cellars or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"when it comes to the radicalization process, it has been established that it begins online. first, the person is cut off from their community, even from their family, so that the extremists feel that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who abhors their behavior and ideology is a traitor or rejected by faith."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalisation, we must stop people to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"as a Muslim, as a mother, as a human, I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imaginations if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux-Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology based on their "holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but when one casts a glance at them, it does not force them to read what they read in their" Holy Scriptures. ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that allows them to read these things into Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she would have joined the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said the problem was exactly the opposite. every clergy who spoke to them brought them to silence and told her that their anger, their sense of injustice in the world, would only bring them into trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"inspired by nothing and something that would have made sense to her anger, she was a major goal for the instrumentalization by extremists who promised her a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This imam restored the connection to God and their church.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of accusing them for their anger, he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">She learned what she learned in the mosque to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">"a study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear, at least three things happen."</seg>
<seg id="359">"we rather accept an authoritarian system of governance, conformity, and prejudice."</seg>
<seg id="360">"a study reveals that when people submit news reports, in which negatively reported about Muslims, they rather have military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"when you see when the mood swings against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">"so Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror, as I expected."</seg>
<seg id="365">"it can indeed be a tool to manipulate the public to undermine the foundation of a free society, which has rational and well informed citizens."</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">"we may feel it first, but the toxic air of fear harms us all."</seg>
<seg id="368">"when it comes to assigning collective guilt, it is not just about having to explain oneself."</seg>

<seg id="372">"his sister would say that he was the sweetest, most generous man she knew."</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was amazed and said:</seg>

<seg id="375">"only a few weeks after her visit to Suzanne with her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, murdered her, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was visiting in the afternoon."</seg>

<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or did we stay safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about what America we want to leave our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can freely exercise our religion."</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the child's seat, we travelled silently, with high pressure to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took him out, pulled off my shoes, went into the hall of prayer, and what I saw let me stop."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the congregation was Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us."</seg>
<seg id="387">At this moment I have collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had advanced courage and compassion panic and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose in the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be safe on number?</seg>

<seg id="407">What started as a platform for hobbyists is shortly before becoming a billionaire business.</seg>
<seg id="408">"control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the potential applications for commercial drones."</seg>
<seg id="409">"before the air package has penetrated our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the FRAC Centre in France has built a six-metre-high tower from 1 500 bricks. some years ago, they started to fly with ropes."</seg>
<seg id="410">"by connecting, flight devices reach high speed and acceleration in the tightest space."</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build up-to-yourself resilient structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">"they have learned to bear loads, deal with turbulence and generally respond to natural laws."</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"in order for a system to work autonomously, it is necessary to know collectively where the mobile objects are located in the room."</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at the ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos, we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a publisher of our laboratory."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">"each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, determine the calculations on board what the machine should do."</seg>
<seg id="420">"external commands are available at the highest eb. e. g." "start" "and" "land". ""</seg>
<seg id="421">"this is a so-called" "rear starter", ""</seg>
<seg id="422">A flight device trying to strike two flies with one flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">"like other starters, it is efficient in forward flight, much more efficient as a helicopter in all its variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"unlike most starters, it can float and has great advantages when starting and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always one downside."</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear-starters is that they react sensitively to turbulence such as wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flight equipment doesn't matter in what position the optimum position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay. that's ok.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often ask for fundamental abstract questions which advance to the heart of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be: what is the smallest number of moveable parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">"helicopters are known as machines with a thousand moveable parts, which meet to hurt you."</seg>
<seg id="434">"decades ago, trained pilots were able to fly remote-controlled flying devices, which had only two movable parts: one propeller and a stern rudder."</seg>
<seg id="435">"recently, we discovered that flying with just one works."</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the monospinner, the mechanically simplest remote-operated flight machine. it was invented recently."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only one moveable part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no flaps, hinges and thrusters, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanically simple, very much happens inside the inner life so that it can fly stable and move everywhere in the room."</seg>
<seg id="440">"however, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear-starters. to bring it to flying, I have to throw it exactly right."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the probability to throw it right when I see all is low, so I'll show you a video that was filmed last night."</seg>
<seg id="442">"if the monospinner is an exercise in contentment, this machine is here, the bus with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">This is why it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">"in this way, it receives the extraordinary ability,"</seg>
<seg id="447">"move in space in all directions, no matter what direction it is rotated or even rotated."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight propellers."</seg>
<seg id="449">"some things can be seen in models, the rest will be learned directly while flying."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's look at this.</seg>
<seg id="451">"if planes are to be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate two-propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This is clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">"when you build them together, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter."</seg>
<seg id="456">"however, if something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller fails, the electronics or a battery - the machine can fly further, though limited."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate this by making a half airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration uses synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a palette of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">We accepted standard micro-quadcopter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where space is in the room and is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully you are motivating these demonstrations to rethink of new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">"the particularly safe machine, on the other hand, wants to become a flying lampshade on Broadway."</seg>
<seg id="464">"of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology."</seg>
<seg id="465">"for guys like us, wages are in development and creative act."</seg>
<seg id="466">"it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures to form them in such spectacular fashion."</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">"1.3 billion years ago, two black holes orbited one another in a very far distant galaxy, so the mass of three suns changed in a tenth of a second in pure energy."</seg>
<seg id="470">For this short moment they lit more brightly than all the stars together in all galaxies of the entire universe known to us.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But their energy did not set them free in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into the space-time structure itself and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us first arrange the events in time.</seg>
<seg id="476">"1.3 billion years ago, multi-cell life was created on Earth."</seg>
<seg id="477">"since then, the Earth has produced a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans and -- God stand up to us -- even the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="478">"about 25 years ago, a group of especially courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever of Caltech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gravitational-waves, which are caused by colliding black holes."</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them considered them crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses so that the US National Science Foundation financed her idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">"after decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Ligo: the laser interferometer- gravity-waves-observatory."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the following period, the precision of Ligo could be increased considerably, which greatly improved the performance."</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced Ligo now.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015 Ligo was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor and persistent problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">"on September 14, 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detector, the gravitational-waves of the two colliatory black holes drilled through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The Birth of My Daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the departure from my sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">"basically, they were the fruits of my life."</seg>
<seg id="492">"AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been studying gravitational-waves from black holes and her through observatories like Ligo measurable signals. but what are gravitational-waves?"</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a clattering in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"when passing the wave, the room and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and stamped into the other."</seg>
<seg id="495">"for illustration, lecturers often conduct a properly vocal dance in courses on the theory of relativity."</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretch and stow, stretch and stow."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational-waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on September 14th, for example, each of us was stretched and stamped when the waves were hit. the elongation of an average man was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"that is 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five-kilometre laser detector, and that is absurd, this length would have to be measured on less than a thousandth of a radius of a nucleus."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">"Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, described the hunt for the waves as follows:" the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous. "</seg>
<seg id="503">"but physicists are inventive, and with the support of the public all obstacles will be overcome."</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne released this 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott likes claiming that Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what that means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your cell."</seg>
<seg id="508">"this is quite practical, because so you can make a picture or a map of things by perceiving the light coming from several points around you."</seg>
<seg id="509">"with tones, that is different."</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"this is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce an image of things that are particularly important to you:"</seg>
<seg id="512">For example the face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead we listen to certain properties like pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume, in order to close the story behind it."</seg>
<seg id="514">"now just Alice speaks."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"dummer Bob,"</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot make simple pictures of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by paying attention to changes in amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">"so when we convert wave patterns into sound, we can hear the All literally."</seg>
<seg id="522">"listening to the gravitation, can tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been busy for quite a long time."</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, non-rotating holes, chirping simple: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">"turn the two bodies very quickly, you hear the same chirp with an additional key signature. that sounds like the" "u-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu" "!"</seg>
<seg id="525">"it is a kind of movement vocabulary, imprinted in the waveform."</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Ligo heard: [Surrender noise] Someone who knows what to listen, this recognizes as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with 30-fold solar mass, which rotate around as fast as the rods of your mixer."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's consider briefly what that means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, orbit a hundred times a second before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know of it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the permanent meaning of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves an entirely new way to explore the universe as it has never been possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the All and listen to the unseen.</seg>
<seg id="535">We can't see much in space -- practically or fundamentally -- not.</seg>
<seg id="536">"a supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereighty stars explode in super-novas."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we have learned a lot about space from them.</seg>
<seg id="538">"but the exciting physical processes happen in the nucleus, which lies hidden behind thousands of kilometres of iron, carbon and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through because these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gravity waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the cosmos, but we will never see it since the Big Bang is covered by its own glimpse."</seg>
<seg id="541">Using gravitational-waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">"and the most important thing: I am optimistic that there exist in the universe that we have never seen, which we will never see and of which we have no idea. things that we only discover by listening."</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, Ligo found things right in the first attempt that we did not expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says on this subject: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes, as Ligo watches them, are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"they are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are, so to speak, the dinosaurs for our archaeological work."</seg>
<seg id="546">"Ligo gives us a completely different perspective on the events in space, the formation of the stars and ultimately also on how we emerged from this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is to be as bold as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">"thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and chirping of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories - a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be nicer than listening to the Big Bang itself?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"for one year I would say" "Yes", "in front of which I was afraid."</seg>
<seg id="556">"whether it made me nervous, brought me into uncomfortable situations, I forced myself to say" Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak in public?</seg>
<seg id="558">"no, but yes!"</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">"no, but yes!"</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start playing?</seg>
<seg id="562">"no, no, no, but yes, yes."</seg>
<seg id="563">"and a crazy thing happened: exactly what I was afraid of, removed my fear."</seg>
<seg id="564">"my anxiety to keep talking, my social anxiety -- puff, gone."</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes" has changed my life.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">"but there was a certain yes that deeply changed my life, to an unexpected style. it began with a question of my smallest."</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson."</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"little kitten, I need milk for my beak-cup."</seg>
<seg id="572">"she asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"from then on, I swear to always play with them as soon as you ask me. no matter what I'm doing, or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">"almost. I am not perfect, but I am very tired."</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, my children, to our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">"but it also has an amazing side effect: only recently, I fully understood that the" "yes" "to play with my children saved my career."</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am a writer. I think of things and get you to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No. no.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I revolve television. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">"I make television, in a large style."</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">"four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production."</seg>
<seg id="588">Each stream offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for one episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"a new episode every nine days and four shows, so every nine days 20 million dollars television, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three shows simultaneously in production are four, 16 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours TV,"</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">"in America, my TV series are running on Thursday evening."</seg>
<seg id="594">"all over the world, my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers."</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broadcasts that I have created myself, and not only produced, so on top of it. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to assemble my fans around the campfire and tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfires burning around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who else does that?</seg>
<seg id="598">"no one, therefore I am a titanium."</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with it.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think when the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">"I tell you, so that all of you who work so hard, whether you run a company, a country or a classroom, take me seriously when I talk about work, so that you understand that I am not just lying on the computer and fanciful, and it's true when I say: I understand that it's not dreaming about a dream job."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I work a lot, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"when I am immersed in the work, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">It's like I set up troops when I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">"as a result, you have a high sound, deliver a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">It feels like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all this at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love working.</seg>
<seg id="612">"she is creative, mechanically, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and sensible. and the best thing about it is the sum."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when work goes well.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a buzz begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzzing sounds like a busy road, I could always drive on it."</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people assume when I declare to them the sums that I'm talking about writing that writing is joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">"don't understand me wrong, it does."</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the sum -- when I started with television production, when I started working and working, building, creating and working together, I discovered this thing, this sum, this energy."</seg>
<seg id="618">The sum is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sum is action and activity. the sum is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The buzz is music. the buzz is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sum is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a buzz, then you can't look different to size."</seg>
<seg id="623">"the feeling of not being different than striving for size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sum.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it also means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of the failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I know only that I am not made for failure, and I only know that I love the sum."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I just want to tell you, I am a titanium and I know that I don't want to question it."</seg>
<seg id="632">"to make one thing clear: the more successful I become, the more episodes, the more episodes, the more work there is, the more work there is, the more I write history, the more expectations there is."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to be successful, the more I must work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love work, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the land I created, the marathon which I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound, the sum, the sum, the sum."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sum. I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sum. I am the sum.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this sum?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the swum stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">"overhauled, overloaded, overdone, burnt out."</seg>
<seg id="642">The buzz stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mom is a single working institute.</seg>
<seg id="644">"Harper tells people," My mum will not be there, but you can write to my Nanny. "</seg>
<seg id="645">"Emerson says:" "little kitten, I want to go to Shonda country."</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1 when the sum ceased."</seg>
<seg id="649">The sum of the engine was silent.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my work any more. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sum did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My buzz was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I made the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours days, worked weekends, no regret, nothing delegating, a titanium does not sleep, doesn't give up, with all your heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no buzz.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">"I was a pre-eminent Titan,"</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was grey, I just had no fun anymore."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzzing and the sum was me.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what do you do when what you do, the work you love, suddenly fade away?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know some may think:" present thyself, stupid author-titanium. "</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know you do it, you do it, you're working, you love what you're doing, a teacher, a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love another and that gives one the sum if you knew the sum, who is one then?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"if the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern servant waitress" asks me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I'm out on the way out, late on it and she says," Mom, do you like playing? "</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say no when two things become aware of me:</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I have to say yes to all and secondly, she didn't call me" "babies". ""</seg>
<seg id="675">She doesn't call anyone any more.</seg>
<seg id="676">When did this happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I miss it when I am Titan and my totum smoother, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says," Mum, do you like to play? ""</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about it.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and her sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" "Everybody Poops". ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding because my pain and panic, loneliness and lack of buoyancy, I can't do anything except to watch out."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am silent.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the country I created, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist."</seg>
<seg id="687">"everything that exists are sticky finger and wet kisses, delicate voices, wax alpencils and the song in which it's about letting go, or whatever the girl is releasing into" The Ice Queen. ""</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so tight that I can barely breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door enters and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and that's not immediately, but it happens, it happens."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The buzz is slowly coming back.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, hardly there, it's quiet, hardly audible, but it is there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the buzzing, but a buzz."</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel as if I know a magic mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the sums, the working sums, the titanic sums, that's only the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, when I describe myself with the help of shows and TV hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real buzz is."</seg>
<seg id="707">The sum is not a force and it is not work-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real buzz depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sum is the current coming from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real buzz is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"real sums ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be completed, the expectation and the pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"the real sum is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered to me the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a Titan?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a bit more love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"as soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">"I do this as a rule, so I can free myself from any guilt as a workaholic."</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is Law, I have no other choice. I have no other choice if I want to hear the sums again."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be so simple. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">"playing is not a way to play, how do you work."</seg>
<seg id="722">"the truth hurts,"</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer working at the workplace than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this admission is painful, because what a person prefers to work than to be home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well, I."</seg>
<seg id="728">"honestly, I call myself" Titan "--"</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">None of it is that I am too relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="731">"we rage around in the garden, back and forth, back and forth."</seg>
<seg id="732">"we make small dance parties,"</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">"I feel mainly stiff, absent, and confused."</seg>
<seg id="736">I always grab my cell phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is ok.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live and the universe of the universe fills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever stopped playing games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also do it! always tell Yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">"perhaps you consider me naive, for a daydreamer."</seg>
<seg id="742">"you are right, but you can do it too!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something different.</seg>
<seg id="748">"it's wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybird or biscuit replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">"and talks my teen-daughter whole 15 minutes with me, I am mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"it is only 15 minutes, more needs it not."</seg>
<seg id="752">"everyone can bring up 15 minutes a piece, even on a bad mood-day!"</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a bit!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction."</seg>
<seg id="755">"the day is short: dinner, the children are ready to go."</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in it!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my well-being, my world. it must not be the children. it is important to feel the humming, to have a place for peace of mind."</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children. it's about pleasure</seg>
<seg id="759">"to play" "games" "in general."</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you are doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and keep it.</seg>
<seg id="763">"friends meet, read books, enjoy the day --"</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" is short for everything I have given up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in the training, when I wanted to surpass myself more and more. "</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes of play - why not treat yourself full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sum came back in my free time. the buzz then seems to return if I do not work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul."</seg>
<seg id="770">"I like the sum, but I don't love it."</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">"I am not the sum, the sum is not me... no more."</seg>
<seg id="773">"soap bubbles and sticky finger, dinner with friends."</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my sum.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">"the sum of the work is part of me, but just a part. and I am so thankful for that."</seg>
<seg id="778">"I have never seen a Titan, the journey to Jerusalem."</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and to play more.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still working. my campfire is still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">"the more I play, the happier I and my children are."</seg>
<seg id="782">"the more I play, the more I feel as a good mother."</seg>
<seg id="783">"the more I play, the more clear my head is."</seg>
<seg id="784">"the more I play, the better I work."</seg>
<seg id="785">"the more I play, the more I hear the sum."</seg>
<seg id="786">"the more I feel this sum, the more this unusual, lasting, naked and new feeling of being is spread in me. less titanium -- more I!"</seg>
<seg id="787">"the more I feel this sum, the more I know who I am."</seg>
<seg id="788">I am a writer. I think of things I get you to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">"this is part of the job, which means living his dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">"this is the dream of this job,"</seg>
<seg id="791">For a dream job should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">"I said" "yes" "to less work and to play more."</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">"like most of my colleagues, I have to do every day with human tragedies."</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another after a severe stroke or a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgeons, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">"they certainly have one of the most well-known, known as" "deep-brain stimulation". "in doing so, an electrode immerses deep in the brain in order to influence the circuits of neurons so that the neurological function is improved."</seg>
<seg id="805">It is truly an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease who suffered from severe tremors and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">"neuromodulation, however, does not mean neuro-cure."</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">History started 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">"at that time I was a senior doctor, working day and night in the emergency room."</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I provided patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">"you have to imagine, that the brain harms the brain and increases the internal pressure of the skull."</seg>
<seg id="815">"in order to save life, you have to reduce the pressure of the skull."</seg>
<seg id="816">"for this, one sometimes needs to remove a portion of swollen brain mass."</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">To let cells grow from one piece of tissue is comparable to very small children extracted from your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">"you have to find the right nutrition, temperature, humidity and the surroundings to thrive."</seg>
<seg id="823">That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">"after many attempts, Jean-François managed to do so."</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw this under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells, surrounded by small, unripe cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">"perhaps you know from biology classes that stem cells are unripe cells, which can turn into any cell type of the organism."</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operation.</seg>
<seg id="832">We did another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They split slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells, but behaved differently."</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They originate from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells hot Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our cerebral cortex cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">You play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">At the stage of the fetus they care for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they get us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We don't know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they take part in the healing of the brain, as we find it at higher concentrations close to brain injuries."</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so sure.</seg>
<seg id="848">But one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that allows brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">"we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area, and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean-François did."</seg>
<seg id="853">And then color them in color to be able to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">"in the last step, we took them to the acceptance test of the same individual."</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplantation -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we have these cells in normal brain tissue and what will happen if we have the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario we checked the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were removed again, they go back home. the room is already occupied, they are not used there, so they disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">"in the second scenario, we inflicted an injury and they had exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neurons."</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we were able to observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been re-chlorinated.</seg>
<seg id="862">"the evidence they show are these little dots. these are the cells that we dye in vitro, in culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">"of course, we could not stop here."</seg>
<seg id="864">Will these cells help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">"when they reached a stable skill level, we injured the motor motor sector in the motor cortex."</seg>
<seg id="869">"as a result, the monkeys were paralyzed, they couldn't move their hand any more."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it would happen in humans, they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree, just like after a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover to a certain degree as well as with the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left you can see the monkey that spontaneously recovered.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">He is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now, when we left the cells, the same monkey, two months after the rice plantation."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were very exciting results for us too.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found out much more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and use them later.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use them in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease."</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implant them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">"Fr. Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that right now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think:" I know someone who can need it. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials on humans."</seg>
<seg id="887">"Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results, one has to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms in order to pass through these kinds of studies."</seg>
<seg id="888">"BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, and so on."</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">"BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and have tried to get permission to start the clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it takes to go to hospital, and this therapy will be available."</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first of all, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authorities permit us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select patients to perform the treatments and assess whether it is useful to do this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply it to a multi-centric study.</seg>
<seg id="897">First you have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">"BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course."</seg>
<seg id="899">"BG: Jocelyne, thank you for your visit to TED and that you told us about it."</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them as self-evident.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we see democracy not as the fragile plant it actually is, but as an inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as immutable infirmity.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">"Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a flourishing capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy winds up with us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- I was unequivocally clear to me as finance minister in the Eurogroup, that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- will not affect the austerity programs that have been realized in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at that moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my sincere friends who told me repeatedly that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">"at this point, I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy."</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China, and even the Eurogroup of misbelief, could save us democracy, but that we need a truthful and defensible democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"for without democracy our societies are blamed, our future gloomy and our great, new technologies wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the topic of waste, I would like to point out to an interesting contradiction that currently threatens our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">"I call it the" "twin summit paradox". ""</seg>
<seg id="916">"a top is known to you. you know and recognize him as the mountain of debt, which throws his long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all recognize the mountain of debt,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize its twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash, which belongs to the wealthy savers and corporations, who are too anxious to invest in it, where it would be productive and income with which one could produce the mountain of debt, and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs, for example" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"over the past three months, 3,4 trillion US dollars have been invested in the United States, England and the euro area, in all the wealth producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so forth."</seg>
<seg id="922">"$3.4 trillion US Dollar sounds like a lot of money, until you compare it with the 5.1 trillion US dollars, which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions, and did absolutely nothing except to inflate the stock markets and raise real estate prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"debt and unproductive capital form the twin summits, which are not offset by the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54 year olds in the United States, Japan and Europe unemployed, and consequently a low aggregate demand which, as in a continuous loop, encourages the pessimism of investors that would be true that his son would kill him if he is grown up,"</seg>
<seg id="925">Inadvertently causes the circumstances causing ecedipus to kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">That is my hair with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents, and especially to finance all the technologies," green "technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the Earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we proceed: what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the Free and the poor as majority control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">"the Athenian democracy, of course, closed too many --"</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of the Athenian democracy due to these degrees."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decisive factor in the democracy of Athenian democracy was and is that she gave up the working arms, and gave them not only the right to freedom of speech but also more important and decisive, which they grant to them the right to political co-determination with the same mood in questions of the State of State."</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy hasn't kept for a long time --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle that shines brightly, it is burned out quickly."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our modern liberal democracies did not have their roots in ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the Athenian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for rulers."</seg>
<seg id="940">"the liberal democracy first appeared when a complete separation between politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics, while the economy -- so the world of corporations - became a more democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in our present democracies, since the time this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle took place between the two, while the economy slowly undermined the politics and dismayed them."</seg>
<seg id="942">Are you wondering why the politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not due to a degeneration of its DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is because the government can now be in the government and still not in power, because the power is immigrated from politics into the economy and the areas are separated."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hair with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"if you think about it, it is like a herd of carnivores that sustainably decimated the animals that they feed on, that they are starving at the end."</seg>
<seg id="947">"the power of corporations is growing, political goods are devalued, political goods are devalued, the general economic demand falls, and the general managers of corporations are too scared to invest in the cash of their companies."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful capitalism distributes the" Demos "from democracy, the higher the twin summits, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if that is true, it is obvious that we have to bring together politics and the economy again, and it would be better if the" Demos "keeps control, just as in ancient Athens, aside from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">"by the way, this is not a new idea."</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it was not very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine of the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only regain their position as in ancient Athens without creating new ways of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: the working poor abolish!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low wage workers through automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is, as long as economics and politics are separate areas, the automation makes the twin peaks higher, the waste becomes more sublime, and the social conflicts deeper, as it is -- very soon, as I believe -- in countries like China."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so we have to redesign the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and make sure that we democratize the reunited area, otherwise we end up in a pathological surveillance hyperautocracy that makes the film" Matrix "appear as a documentation."</seg>
<seg id="957">So the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that he has produced.</seg>
<seg id="958">"the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to that in" matrix, "or by something that the society in" Star Trek "resembles in which machines serve people and people indulge their energy in the exploration of the universe, or to indulge in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians" Agora, "in long discussions the meaning of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it be like to have this "Star Trek" -like utopia instead of the "Matrix" like Dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples, in a nutshell."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the area of companies: please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from one job to another, from a company to the next, and the company -- no matter where you are working -- is property of those who currently work in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">"then all income comes from capital and proceeds, and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="964">"there is no differentiation between those who belong to the enterprises, who do not work in it, and employees who work there, but not belong to the company. no more exchange between capital and labour, no big gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no uplifting twin peaks."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the sphere of global political economy: please introduce briefly that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate in a universal, global, digital currency, issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund] and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging countries] in the interests of the whole of mankind."</seg>
<seg id="966">"imagine that the world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it" the Cosmos, "in units of" Cosmos "-- and every government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund."</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that this fund is investing in green technology, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed at Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today, we have them, especially against the background of a re-united politics and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world I describe to you is simultaneously liberating, in which they prefer privileged persons, and Marxian because they will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the trash of history, and Keynesian, globally keynesian."</seg>
<seg id="973">"but above all, it is a world in which we can imagine real democracy."</seg>
<seg id="974">We will wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratic.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography as the libertarian Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">"Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I have just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant."</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... Do we not do this, technological developments will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand, which Larry Summers said as" "long-term stagnation." ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"by transferring this crisis from one part of the world to the next, as we are currently experiencing, it will not only destabilise our democracies but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is true, then Marx is quite relevant,"</seg>
<seg id="986">"like Hayek, that is why I am a libertarian Marxist, and like Keynes, and therefore I am completely swirling."</seg>
<seg id="987">"BG: indeed, and now we are."</seg>
<seg id="988">"YV: if you don't work, you don't think enough."</seg>
<seg id="989">"BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said that. BG: in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at supper the speakers you have said very clearly what you think of the West's point of view on China."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the appearance of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy on politics, while the area where most plays out -- the area of economics -- is a completely democratic area."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in a certain sense, if I may say that provocative, China is similar today to the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- this is an error historically regarded.</seg>
<seg id="996">"liberalism, liberals, like John Stuart Mill --"</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical concerning the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">"what we can observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, particularly the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"now to blame China now to do what the West did in the 19th century itself, smells enormous after hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I sensed that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later for the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing, as we had the opportunity to make a new start with the Eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the Eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"to say good-bye to the self-complacency, and the continual denial that a massive fault line went through the Eurozone, and continues, which massively threatens the development of the whole European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way, the first suggestion that revealed this denial --"</seg>
<seg id="1008">"unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the European Union, have continued to adopt the denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if you try to get an economic system that is not viable, by political will and authoritarianism, you might be able to delay it for a while, but when the changes occur, it happens abruptly and destructive."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you foresee?</seg>
<seg id="1013">"YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future, if we do not change its structure."</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- Ernst...</seg>
<seg id="1017">"if there is a Minister of Finance, or any Minister who is in office after 6 months, especially in such a tense situation, he claims that he has made no mistake, then this is a dangerous person."</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the motion for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest on the sides of the donor to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But there was no such thing.</seg>
<seg id="1022">"they just wanted to bring our government down, just because they did not want to deal with the distortions going through the eurozone."</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't want to admit that they had been a disastrous program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">This is worse than during the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">"none of the lenders of the creditors imposed on us by this policy stood up:" "this was a colossal error."</seg>
<seg id="1027">"BG: despite all that, and despite the aggressive tone of the talks, you seem to be still quite pro-European."</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1030">My biggest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">"for if it does not survive, the shared centrifuges will be demonic and destroy the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1032">"this will not have disastrous consequences for Europe alone, but for the entire world economy."</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">"if we allow ourselves to adopt the way of a post-modern 1930 what it appears to me, it will be equally intolerable for the future of Europeans as well as non-Europeans."</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you will be wrong at this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">"Yanis, thank you for being with TED."</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">"Roy Price has never heard most of them, although he probably is responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on April 19, 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is senior employee at Amazon Studios</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slim, has an Igelfrisur and describes himself on Twitter as" Movies, TV, Technique, Tacos. ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for choosing the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very hard fought industry."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV shows that Roy can't choose any.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he has to find shows, which are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he has to find shows that are located quite right on this corner."</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the valuation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the website IMDB. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review is received.</seg>
<seg id="1050">"will your show be judged with nine and higher, this is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these are shows like" Breaking Bad, "" Game of Thrones, "" The Wire "- all the shows that are addictive where, after watching a relay, your brain asks:" where are there more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left side, here at this end, shows like" Toddlers and Tiaras "-- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1055">"Roy Price is not worried about getting to the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to undermine" Toddlers and Tiaras. ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he has more thoughts about the medium payout, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't excite."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must ensure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the pressure is present, and of course it's the first time Amazon is doing something, so Roy Price wants nothing to risk."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he needs a guaranteed success, so he holds a competition."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online, where they can watch for free."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon releases things for free, you're going to get right?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers watch these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">You are watched by Roy and his team who are recording everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you record when you start the show, when you pause, which parts you skips or look again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data in order to determine which show they should produce with these data.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they collect the data, process them, and this results in the answer, and this is:" Amazon should make a sitcom via four republican American senators. ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," Alpha House, "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't that good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it's just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7,4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- i.e. slightly above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"about the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking to find it a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it something different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of hosting a competition, he and his team have looked at the existing data on the Netflix audience, so the reviews they give the shows, their course, what shows they like etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, which producers, which actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all the parts together, they entered a venture and decided not to make a sitcom over four Senators, but a drama series about a senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," "House of Cards". "Netflix thus landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons."</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9.1 review on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">"of course, the question is: what happened here?"</seg>
<seg id="1081">"there are two very competitive, data-sealed companies."</seg>
<seg id="1082">"they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company."</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow says that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"if you collect millions of data, for a decision you meet, you should make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It optimizes it with very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"what you can expect is good television, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis does not work, then this is a bit frightening because we live in a time in which we reach more and more to statistics to make serious choices, far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health Systems here?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"no one. OK, that's even good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one in this room will ever come into contact with this software. come into contact with it you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if someone is in jail here in the U.S. and asks for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine if there is a dismissal or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it is decided whether a person will be good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"moderate TV, 22 minutes, this can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are produced. that's not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data of the most experienced companies is also wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"in 2009, Google announced that it could predict outbreaks from flu, the bad way -- by analyzing data from Google's research."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked fine, year by year, until it suddenly stopped functioning,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And nobody could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it simply did not work, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of publication in the magazine" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data experienced companies like Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"despite all these errors, data streams into decisions of life -- at work, in law enforcement, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should better make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very smart people use unimaginable many data to make serious choices as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I have recognized some patterns regarding the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"if you have to solve a complex problem, do two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"first dismantle this problem into its parts, so that you can analyze the individual components; as a second, put the individual parts together again in order to make a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to dismantle a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we all possess it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">"if there is something in which the brain is good, it is necessary to put parts and pieces together again, even if the information is incomplete, in order to make a good decision - especially if it is the brain of an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"therefore, I think, Netflix was so successful because they used data and minds where they also belong in the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to better understand their audience, what else they wouldn't have been able to do. but the decision on how to take all these parts and make a show like" House of Cards, "was not in the data."</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team made this decision for this show which meant that they had a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">"Amazon however, did this in the wrong way."</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their decisions, first as they competing for TV ideas, then selecting" Alpha House "as a show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">"it was a safe decision, because they could always say," "This is the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data is helpful for better decisions, but I think things go wrong when data start to steer our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and to not forget this, this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before there was data, this was the device for decision making."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"it is also called" Magic 8 Ball. "it's amazing. for decisions using a ja- or no-question, you just have to shake the ball to get an answer." most likely "-- right here at this moment."</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will challenge it later with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"so far I have made some decisions in my life, whereby I should have listened to the ball afterwards."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you naturally know when you have the data available, you want to replace it with a much more elaborate, such as data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"in the end, it is up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data it still pays off to make decisions, to be an expert in what you are doing and risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"in the end, it is not the data, but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
