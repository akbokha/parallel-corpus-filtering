Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
an Ir@@ ren @-@ Anst@@ alt for young people to meet today .
a chapel that is now dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
farmers cultivate the former basis of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories about days .
it anno@@ ys when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows this because the car @-@ Nav@@ i showed a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bayern @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ al Bavaria of the state government , are anything but up to date - but just therefore very informative . &quot;
especially when compared with current online maps .
then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread @-@ area of Munich &apos;s Merk@@ ur since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work carpet that is not immediately recognized as such .
&quot; detailed maps , so @-@ called document sheets , were incorporated into the large overview map for towns and municipalities . &quot;
these were created according to the Bavarian sur@@ veying management between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French military leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
&quot; even though the French troops finally departed with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on 9 February 18@@ 01 , the present @-@ day neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria map . &quot;
&quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV Joseph drove the project forward , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bavarian sur@@ veying management . &quot;
the manuscript for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is to be found like all others on the website of the Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek .
&quot; the comparison of earlier / today is most impressive , for example , the state capital . &quot;
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
&quot; an example of this is the sub@@ conscious , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 . &quot;
&quot; he was born 21 years after the drawing up of the map , in 18@@ 77 , in the district of Munich . &quot;
&quot; today , Unter@@ send@@ ling is in the middle of the city . &quot;
&quot; the houses of Unter@@ send@@ ling are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the present Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ strasse , which was named after George Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser until 1878 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today is the West@@ park , one sees nothing as fields - at first sight : when zo@@ oming in appears a small @-@ part card with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ written numbered fl@@ ur@@ ings from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; urine &quot; &quot; from which the basic tax was derived . &quot;
small plots show no more farmers there today - but small@@ gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; Land in sun . &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ send@@ ling .
&quot; Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , the site of the Oktober@@ fest since 18@@ 10 , was actually still a meadow - and no concrete desert . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the field of the present district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; &quot; Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; &quot; or the &quot; &quot; Auf der Lü@@ fte &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße , one once locked people with del@@ u@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 , the Munich District @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; On der Au@@ er Lü@@ fte &quot; was born there . &quot;
&quot; from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden led the institution - the psychiat@@ rist , who was brought to the death of King Ludwig II . &quot;
&quot; he was progressive for his time and , for example , ended the anchor of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot;
&quot; he also for@@ bi@@ ds the personnel to employ violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who has worked for an exhibition with the institution . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients it was first place , later it was extended to 500 seats . &quot;
at some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the circular ren@@ dez@@ v@@ ous in hair 1905 .
&quot; since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ric centres , has been located there since 2006 . &quot;
&quot; at the site of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt , young people now meet in the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um . &quot;
the order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it to a youth hostel with training facilities .
&quot; West is the football field of the TS@@ V Munich East , east of residential buildings from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was built - architec@@ turally reminiscent of the original building of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , which was destroyed during the Second World War in bombing ra@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was registered in 18@@ 56 as &quot; Main Square , &quot; the Kauf@@ inger@@ straße was named &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot; &quot;
the Second World War brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
&quot; in December 1944 , the Al@@ lied bombs burst into the city centre . &quot;
a large remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
&quot; the English institute , small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days will be the prepar@@ atory work and on April 5 , 2017 , the ground @-@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn commu@@ ter line . &quot;
&quot; with the slider , the old Munich @-@ map can be compared with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof . &quot;
civil Rights Group publishes warnings for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for Far@@ ab@@ by has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to the discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks of the state .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which will enter into force by August 28 , 2017 , ur@@ ges af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to pay special attention when travelling through the state , as a series of question@@ able , race @-@ based incidents occur throughout the country and will be noted here , &quot; says the Group &apos;s opinion . &quot;
&quot; a recently adopted law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it people harder to claim discrimination , as well as prosec@@ uting authorities of the state who are dispro@@ portion@@ ately targeting minorities , prompted the group to release the warning , said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot;
they have violations of civil rights that happen to people .
&quot; they are stopped because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the president of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot;
we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet .
it is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States .
&quot; the group cited incidents such as rac@@ ist crimes against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no more fuel during the journey , and was put into custody by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i without being accused of a crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council also points out a recent report by the Office of the Mis@@ sour@@ i At@@ tor@@ ney General , which shows that black drivers will be held in the state 75 percent more often than wh@@ ites . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot;
people need to be willing to bring money or to know relatives that they travel through the state .
&quot; Mis@@ sour@@ i awarded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the F@@ BI &apos;s hate crime report , which rank the state with respect to the number of such injuries to the 16th position of the country . &quot;
the warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company for housing or employment discrimination .
&quot; prior to that , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states passed immigration laws that commit local law enforcement authorities to arrest people because of immigration violations , which will contribute to further racial profil@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but lately stakeholders have used the measure to respond to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
turn@@ down project is elementary
the Fischer@@ bach Wei@@ de@@ fence project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year .
the CD@@ U Par@@ liam@@ entary Committ@@ ees Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have provided an image on the spot .
representatives of the Fisch@@ bacher @-@ CD@@ U @-@ centre @-@ association gathered together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties at the right @-@ grab@@ bing family of Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
&quot; Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann granted first insights into his company , in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 milk cows and also many young animals and accommodated in five apartments holiday palaces . &quot;
&quot; for him , the &quot; Black Forest milk &quot; is the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows , such as Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este is only Regi@@ on@@ ales .
&quot; since he is also the chair of BL@@ H@@ V , he called the &quot; &quot; electric fence project &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; elementary importance &quot; . &quot; &quot;
I cannot profit on such steep areas .
&quot; the grass@@ land surface care for a lot of work , a lot must be processed with the br@@ ush@@ cutter . &quot;
&quot; we have here to fight with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; stressed Mr Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental operation and managed this without chemical plant protection and fer@@ til@@ iser , even if he did not conduct bio @-@ operation . &quot;
&quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; the Commune has recognised the significance of the electric fence project and is happy about the promotion of its leaders . &quot;
&quot; at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are , farmers would have to be supported . &quot;
I hope that the aff@@ or@@ estation of the areas could be extended quite a while .
&quot; the biggest treasure we have are the people who work in agriculture and think about how to continue their business , &quot; said the mayor . &quot;
the farmers are often critici@@ zed for the promotion
&quot; in 2013 , a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in over the electric fence feed . &quot;
&quot; thus , the area of disclosure is 40 hectares , which cannot be aff@@ or@@ ested until at least 20@@ 23 . &quot;
&quot; half of the total cost of 71 500 euros was promoted via Leader , a quarter carried the municipality of Fisch@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; thus , farmers stayed 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 km of pasture @-@ fence . &quot;
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ gevity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; you are doing a really good job without farmers and farmers . &quot;
&quot; Peter Weiss also stood firm : &quot; &quot; here , best gro@@ c@@ eries are produced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ scape Conservation Line ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows state support of pasture @-@ f@@ ences .
the aim is to maintain the Black Forest .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; in addition , the fen@@ cing area must not be pass@@ able ( han@@ de@@ ft above 35 per cent ) and must therefore be threatened by the aff@@ or@@ estation . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , eight participants with 24 plots , who would like to build a fence around 16 kilometres of fence , are currently running for the Fis@@ her@@ men Wei@@ z@@ aun@@ ching Project 2018 . &quot;
&quot; the area of disclosure corresponds to 35 hectares , and the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros . &quot;
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tru@@ mp takes up the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
&quot; the Americans like this as well as any other - therefore , the sor@@ tu@@ ally staged fall of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 . &quot;
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tru@@ mp Regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated quar@@ rel with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CN@@ N about the President &apos;s proposals for the dr@@ astic limitation of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to be fair , Miller didn &apos;t handle the statue himself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of boat owners and liberty im@@ it@@ ators would have liked him if he had done it .
&quot; but it resor@@ ted to its importance , and in particular the significance it was attributed to when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base . &quot;
&quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta compla@@ ined , &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a complete thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world . &quot;
the poem on which you refer to which was later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty .
&quot; Miller is fac@@ tu@@ ally correct , but as he formulated it himself , it is not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary resonance of the angry words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your tired , your poor , / your afflicted masses , who y@@ earn to breathe freely , and the mis@@ erable waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time in which the &quot; mis@@ erable garbage &quot; on our screens was better to see .
Miller didn &apos;t get involved in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people were not welcome in Tru@@ mp@@ s USA .
this conflict because of the meaning of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation : it is in fact a conflict about the importance of America .
&quot; Lazarus - and her friends , who set themselves to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they had performed a highly political act . &quot;
the sculpture was to show the ties between French and American Repub@@ lic@@ anism by portra@@ ying the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classical depic@@ tion .
&quot; Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice . &quot;
and she gives herself a completely different name : mother of the ex@@ iles .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist cou@@ p and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , the people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the great writing of R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tru@@ mp , argued that the Statue of Liberty is not a drawer but rather an early neo @-@ conservative , who brings the American flame to the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward . &quot;
it is intended to carry out the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
the torch is not meant to enligh@@ ten the way to the United States . &quot;
&quot; quite unusual , Lim@@ bau@@ gh has come across something here . &quot;
the meaning of the statue is completely and even a question of the point of view of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , mis@@ erable , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible voy@@ ages on the deck of ships . &quot;
it is in the tru@@ est sense to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and have a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear .
&quot; of course , this is not the perspective that Miller and Tru@@ mp have ever wanted to acknowledge . &quot;
&quot; their torch should not light the way , but ign@@ ite the hatred that is their only source of power . &quot;
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish Members of the Great Britain team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle reminis@@ ces about a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the team of Great Britain
&quot; the Director of Ath@@ le@@ tics of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship loader will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes were selected for London 2017 that ki@@ cks off on Friday .
&quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; Scotland is developing something special &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn from it . &quot;
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it , and we will continue it until we find it out , &quot; Black said . &quot;
I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances is , it &apos;s absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ wand - who are competing against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m circuit , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was chosen by the team to captain . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest . &quot;
&quot; your captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or where ever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h brought together was great .
&quot; the Com@@ mon@@ wealth Silver medal winner , who will compete in their fifth world champi@@ onships in the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; unbelievable &quot; that 16 Scot@@ sman are in the British team . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 . &quot;
the road @-@ runner Mu@@ ir leads along this road and last year has set up five British and two European records .
&quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman , which one should observe after a great season which included the British Team Tri@@ als and Anni@@ versary Games . &quot;
Do@@ yle reminis@@ ces about their first world champi@@ onships when the only other Scot@@ sman was in Team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell .
&quot; the team captain tells them that they are &quot; enormously proud &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases they will also be involved in the medals and fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the special thing about being a team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my team@@ mates voted for me and chose me , makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
obviously I am very proud of all the Scot@@ sman who belong to the team .
it only shows how far we have come .
&quot; and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to rise to po@@ di@@ ums . &quot;
what concerns my speech as captain ?
&quot; yes , I think she went well . &quot;
I have only pointed out that in this situation we are very happy as we have a home world championship .
so it &apos;s really important to put on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion Berlin .
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there .
blocking criticism from critics on Facebook : don &apos;t worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate the heating of voters
the father of our country knew somewhat of bad press .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not last long until the newspapers hit him because of everything , from domestic politics to his political principles . &quot;
&quot; he kno@@ cked at the cri@@ tique , sure . &quot;
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot;
&quot; this brings me to Mary@@ land governor Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an , who has to work on being more like Washington . &quot;
Ho@@ gans employees have blocked and deleted posts by at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union accused him of this in the beginning of this week .
&quot; the governor &apos;s staff dismissed the suit as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online comment was full of a counter reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; many people said . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it is a guy like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is aston@@ ish@@ ingly popular .
it has the second highest agreement of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary heat @-@ head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very skill@@ ful to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and to debate his hair @-@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
therefore the blocking of persons coming to the side of the governor - which is a public forum known as officially and of employees paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans spokes@@ woman Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse defended the governor &apos;s actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation . &quot;
but it &apos;s too easy to use the picture of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hat@@ eful people who swing the whi@@ p online .
the mail talked to some of the real people blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; and these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur and a pastor , no troll@@ s . &quot;
&quot; they all said their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and non @-@ professional . &quot;
the pastor cited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
&quot; attorney Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not bot@@ tled , but she asked for Hass@@ an . &quot;
&quot; I commented pol@@ itely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary box of the news agency &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t really appreciate this idea , if a number of people take a position on the same topic , then they are desp@@ ised by some rather than a so @-@ called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the Govern@@ ors referred to as &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attacks &quot; , &quot; others would probably call &quot; interc@@ ession . &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment .
&quot; it is much cleaner than in earlier times , if you have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles , or to arrest and silence prot@@ esters . &quot;
but this is exactly what happens digital .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public official who critic@@ ises Facebook and other social media .
President Tru@@ mp is accused of Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell last week in Virginia .
&quot; the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County viol@@ ated the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to US District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when she ban@@ ished a vot@@ er from her Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
it should not be that difficult .
&quot; at the time of Washington , the time of an affordable port had a similar effect on the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers was multiplied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous writing writers crashed into his leadership . &quot;
and even then Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
&quot; people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot;
&quot; the peti@@ tions , which critici@@ zed his position on the contract of am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Britain , over@@ came his office , according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project . &quot;
but he did not silence her .
&quot; freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses belong to the foundation of our nation . &quot;
and true leadership means accepting this .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort at Renaissance Club
former European Union No 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for home comfort over the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , who last year led alongside Arch@@ er@@ field Links to En@@ dr@@ unde , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is associated with the new location and acts as tournament ambassador in the name of the association founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built and we see how he achieved fame with this event , &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; players will see this course from their best side , it &apos;s in a great state . &quot;
Jer@@ ry did a great job when he set up this place .
he is a keen advocate of this game and is proud of his achievement here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
&quot; the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , even though he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career . &quot;
&quot; this really feels special , &quot; said the player based in South@@ port . &quot;
&quot; I cannot defend Extre@@ ma@@ dur@@ a Open , as it was taken out of the program in the year after I won it . &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories of the past year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here . &quot;
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate .
&quot; Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday earlier this year , returns to the action on the home floor . &quot;
this event will be the first Scottish appearance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a little more when you play at home , &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this additional pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
I am happy about how much has happened .
&quot; the trio on the field are former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ alles . &quot;
&quot; the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belongs to the six Sc@@ ots in the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dru@@ m@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; entrance is free , the parking costs £ 5 per car with a passenger and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers . &quot;
all proceeds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less lung cancer rate due to passive smoking
&quot; over the past two decades , fewer and fewer people have died of lung cancer due to passive smoking . &quot;
scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) are coming to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates , 16@@ 7 lung cancer cases are due to passive smoking per year , &quot; &quot; said Student Director Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot;
&quot; as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this issue of 1994 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , there were still 400 lung cancer cases due to passive smoking per year in Germany . &quot;
the new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health .
house connections prove to be very complex
&quot; construction works in Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; lie reasonably in time , &quot; says the director of the architect Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the house connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as there is much hiding in the underground , which is not mentioned in the plans . &quot;
&quot; traffic , which is constantly ham@@ pered by the construction work , is a big problem for the contractor of the company St@@ ump@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the ignorance of drivers from red lights and barriers is enormous , &quot; reports Hein@@ ze . &quot;
the road is closed and only the scheduled buses are authorized to navigate .
&quot; Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z and Tim Kost@@ or@@ z from the company St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks . &quot;
&quot; the hot days were already quite exhau@@ sting .
&quot; but luckily we were supplied with cool mineral water from our friend Fritz Matt , &quot; Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z says . &quot;
poverty and death in the Indon@@ esian gold@@ land
&quot; when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she doesn &apos;t use a stove . &quot;
it even rarely uses a pot .
&quot; in its wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai rain in the ind@@ ent Indon@@ esian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour , the char@@ red tu@@ ber is removed and dev@@ oured with eag@@ erly , un@@ washed hands . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture , where she also performs her daily work , e.g. clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp . &quot;
a bucket in a homeless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
&quot; as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , her fields were not assigned . &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; of course it can be dangerous to work late : most of the villa@@ gers are unemployed , and many are drinking heavily , and there are soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to run around after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote in front of the occupying troops . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , which stir@@ red up the independence of Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal observers from it . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province was officially distributed in Papua and West Papua , with the independent part of Papua New Guinea covered the eastern part of the island . &quot;
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as remote as it is . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 hour drive with a car .
there is no public transportation .
&quot; the town with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants is made up of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fen@@ cing , and of corrugated boxes , which were converted into several yellow @-@ brown tones through rust . &quot;
&quot; only a few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners . &quot;
&quot; before Christian missionaries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans worshipped a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to their lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , their dark shirt and their bright skirt . &quot;
&quot; in the past , we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot;
&quot; Papua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live under the poverty line and have some of the worst infant mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia . &quot;
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s gold land .
&quot; the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gr@@ ass@@ berg , owned by Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an of Phoenix , lies only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Free@@ port was reduced to $ 3.1 billion in gold and copper . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there is a value of $ 78 billion worth of wood resources . &quot;
&quot; these riches , however , are a source of misery for the Papua which ensure that Indon@@ esi@@ ans have protected a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence . &quot;
&quot; an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid local military units and units between 1998 and 2004 , almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars to a single officer . &quot;
&quot; Pap@@ u@@ anas demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten these golden G@@ ans , and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly . &quot;
&quot; according to information from activists , more than 500@@ ,000 of Papua have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed and imprisoned by the Indon@@ esian military since 1969 . &quot;
&quot; according to the Asia Human Rights Commission , mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s tribal land in the 1970 @-@ s were genocide . &quot;
&quot; in the region alone , the Indon@@ esian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we Will Cre@@ ate Every@@ thing &quot; &quot; is in a report of the Or@@ e dioc@@ ese of Bris@@ ban@@ e from 2016 , in which reports about atro@@ cities of the previous year are contained , such as un@@ lawful exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electro@@ sur@@ ges are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims as every week incidents happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
the bolts have increased since Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic development is changing because Muslim economic migrants are from the population @-@ rich islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ p cant@@ een sells fried chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce served . &quot;
local people fight to keep up here .
&quot; the migrants have begun to sell chi@@ ckens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai indigenous , who moved to work in the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
&quot; it cost the native Papua , the mo@@ m mo@@ m &#91; the women &#93; of Papua - their market . &quot;
&quot; the Indon@@ esian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , popul@@ arly known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised the ine@@ qualities and violations of rights in Papua during his campaign in 2014 . &quot;
the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
&quot; but Papua has changed a little , and today locals feel che@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a low point only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is inauguration in October . &quot;
&quot; on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indon@@ esian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle . &quot;
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should switch on their spot@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers took off@@ ence to their sound and later returned to four soldiers , the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted and beat the group with their guns , said the victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
&quot; a child , 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ o , was so badly beaten that he fell into coma . &quot;
a few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
&quot; about 1,000 young Papua people , women and children gathered on a football pitch in front of the local police station and the Military Command Center to demand justice . &quot;
they carried cerem@@ onial hunting bows and led the Wa@@ ita dance - in a circle continuously and im@@ iti@@ sing a bird song - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators started throwing stones on police and military posts .
&quot; when the mood was heated , the soldiers sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; it says in an official document of TI@@ ME , which was not released to the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto neighbourhood of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the im@@ minent danger and called for peace and urged the crowd to return home . &quot;
no one was in the mood to listen .
&quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot in my left wrist , &quot; &quot; he told TI@@ ME on the ver@@ and@@ ah of his colorful painted wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ aking still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here . &quot;
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was met three times , so his cous@@ in , the witness of the shooting . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and searched his body to make sure he was , &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans only bears a name , the TI@@ ME in glo@@ omy mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I knew him .
&quot; the chief inspec@@ tor of the Papua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , re@@ port@@ edly told re@@ porters that his officers wanted to &quot; back up their station &quot; because they were attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves if people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; said the State Police Spe@@ aker , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ tan@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured . &quot;
the news about the kill@@ ings arrived at the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura for three weeks in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical gri@@ ev@@ ances in Papua .
&quot; I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , Minister of Safety , Wi@@ ran@@ to , said that he had extra@@ judicial mechanism for the settlement of historical human rights violations . &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries have occurred a long time ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to tackle these violations , but there are processes that need to be passed , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; then Wi@@ ran@@ to made a retreat when he spoke to TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta , saying that he had no plans to establish a complaint in Papua . &quot;
&quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Vi@@ ran@@ to , who accused the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; accused more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence vote in 1999 , said that 11 cases of violations of human rights have already been committed in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such claims with fi@@ erc@@ ely un@@ belief .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says he is still living in fear for years .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , afraid to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ robat repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the corp@@ ses , the military sought me , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indon@@ esian police ra@@ ged on villa@@ gers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a confrontation between village residents and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring an unconscious husband to the hospital , a person died and 17 others were injured , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 year old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he f@@ ished in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital . &quot;
excited villa@@ gers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s sit@@ ing office .
the police said the villa@@ gers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( Indon@@ esian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be ven@@ ge@@ ance , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered here , the TI@@ ME . &quot;
&quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai parliament has called for an account of the officers involved and to withdraw the police &apos;s mobile bri@@ g@@ ade from the area .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a flash@@ point for the Indon@@ esian government .
&quot; the lack of meaningful development rein@@ forces the dis@@ content of the family members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , living in the green high@@ lands of Papua . &quot;
&quot; many joined the &quot; Free Papua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army claiming to defend the rights of Papua by encouraging spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indon@@ esian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ den Kog@@ o@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to this , in recent years thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbitr@@ arily taken into custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; securing national sovereignty . &quot; &quot;
some never appear again .
&quot; among the people in Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot;
poverty strengthens dis@@ satisfaction .
&quot; the little rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is too expensive for locals . &quot;
bread is just as out of range .
people here grow everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potato .
&quot; you keep most of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market . &quot;
&quot; ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indon@@ esian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) . &quot;
&quot; in the course of time , economic ine@@ qualities between the local Papua and the new migrants have grown , which have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new flight routes to Nab@@ ire Airport . &quot;
the few jobs that exist in the region tend to go to the better educated and prosper@@ ous migrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Papua people rarely have capital or the necessary skills to make their own companies competitive . &quot;
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribal council of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions on reporting international media remain ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , even though the rare permission for filming was given to them . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy Asian director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ai &apos;s campaign to raise the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists attempting to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ quiet eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua : visa den@@ ying and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indon@@ esian government remains largely confined to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March , six Pacific States - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate &quot; various and widespread violations &quot; in Papua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting . &quot;
the same countries have historically supported the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indon@@ esian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r , rejected the group &apos;s accus@@ ations and told journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; in Indonesia , there is still a democratic system , and there are free media , making it difficult to cover the evidence for human rights cases . &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
&quot; when an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the human right @-@ ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura , visited J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4 , locals broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source , which also took part in the meeting , but would remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua people say that they will probably not vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i again . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribal council . &quot;
&quot; he wants Jok@@ ow@@ i to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military , is in poor educational and health services . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ i says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , consider their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; fault &quot; which he has to pay back . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite threats and in@@ timi@@ dations , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai cas@@ u@@ alties led a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the corp@@ se of an victim was buried on a site exactly opposite the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that they may never give them justice , but at least they do not forget those responsible for their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ robat with lowered head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
&quot; a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai , forcing hundreds of inhabitants to flee from the 3@@ 37 metres high , 79 @-@ storey building . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire that is swept through the sky@@ scra@@ per in just two years , which is called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) by chance . &quot;
&quot; the building was evacu@@ ated , there were no reported injuries and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; we slept and we got up with the fire alarm and at the scre@@ ams of the people .
&quot; we ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; &quot; said a resident who named his name George An@@ ab , Reu@@ ters . &quot;
Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that the fire fighting units were extingu@@ ishing the fire at 4.@@ 00 a.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 clock GMT ) and cooled the building .
the government said it was working on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can revi@@ ve questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rise buildings all over the world .
&quot; a study by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage from facing , outer covering for decoration or insulation , came . &quot;
&quot; in Britain , the police said , they believe that the system of plates for insulation and facing at the London Gren@@ fell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup Reform : next Best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has failed with his big Davis Cup coup at the Annual General Meeting .
&quot; at the Ho Chi Min@@ h City meeting , the proposal to play Davis Cup single only on two winning positions was not supported by the two @-@ third majority . &quot;
&quot; the five @-@ sentence classics , which are often very long , are therefore preserved to the traditional competition . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of the member countries voted for reform , the goal of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only slightly missed . &quot;
we respect this decision but are disappointed that our members have not adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup .
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical competitions , &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
you will continue to work on improving the application .
&quot; not until the vote , after many in@@ consist@@ encies , the proposal had already come to finish the final in a neutral place . &quot;
&quot; new from 2018 are only comparatively small details : in future , the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will have the host right next year in the first round . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements for training positions etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to complete less official media appointments ahead of the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; more than one out of 5 US travelers brings forbidden articles into the aircraft , finds out a survey &quot;
&quot; a survey among passengers sur@@ rendered that more than 20 percent consciously or un@@ consciously prohibited articles were smu@@ g@@ gled to the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft , while they acci@@ dentally wore prohibited knives or other objects with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 percent claimed they had been late to discover that they had gone ast@@ ray with fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; the survey by more than 1,000 people - carried out by a jet charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also stated that younger travellers tend to ignore the rules . &quot;
&quot; by the respon@@ dents who admitted that they have know@@ ingly tried to fly with something banned by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als were compared to less than 15 percent , the members of Generation X were . &quot;
the most common items passed by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
&quot; more than 3 per cent said to have know@@ ingly carried items with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male respon@@ dents confirmed that they had intentionally brought illegal drugs to the aircraft . &quot;
the company said it was asking travelers all over the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally killed smu@@ g@@ gling goods by airport security and how many did it intentionally .
&quot; it is no surprise that people who are most likely smu@@ g@@ gling goods - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry the safety , those who were the most frequent . &quot;
&quot; however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using . &quot;
people are often uns@@ af@@ e what liquids they can take with or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the greatest amount of liquids confis@@ cated by the T@@ SA are forbidden liquids .
for a while people thought T@@ SA could look at books as smu@@ g@@ gling goods .
&quot; liquids are permitted on domestic flights , but not on international flights . &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k does not matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel order
&quot; electro @-@ thous@@ and@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k enjoys a huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , he has hitherto under@@ estimated that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the always trium@@ phant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la @-@ Chef El@@ on Mus@@ k has revealed a different , less gl@@ it@@ tering number when announ@@ cing the latest quar@@ terly balance : the cancell@@ ations on the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Mus@@ k frequently had more than 500@@ ,000 orders for the new car , whose delivery just commen@@ ced . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ k now conce@@ des : from the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre@@ orders 6@@ 3,000 have already been withdrawn . &quot;
critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are merely non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; in case of cancellation Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the USA 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; &quot; reservation payment &quot; &quot; completely . &quot;
&quot; at present 45@@ ,000 such non @-@ binding reservations stipul@@ ate that Mus@@ k admitted in a telephone conference with analysts . &quot;
&quot; however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of up to now about twelve percent of all orders could become a problem . &quot;
&quot; his argument : the challenge with the ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side . &quot;
&quot; last year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; in 2018 , all models will be together - 500@@ ,000 , 2020 a million . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , 1800 bookings are made every day . &quot;
&quot; who orders a &quot; Model 3 &quot; today must expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand new , never @-@ tested production lines without any major interrup@@ tions with maximum capacity utilization . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; however , if there are too much delays , the non @-@ binding of the reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; because then , the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from being in dro@@ ves . &quot;
EPA chief P@@ ru@@ itt withdraw@@ s due to dela@@ ying the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules to reduce emissions
&quot; one day after being su@@ ed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , head of the Environmental Protection Agency , with@@ drew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules in order to reduce emissions of smoke @-@ causing air pollutants . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change when his agency proved to meet the needs of state environmental authorities more responsive than previous administr@@ ations .
&quot; he did not notice the complaint , which had been raised against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it is about a deadline , which expi@@ red on 1 October for states to comply with the 2015 OECD standards for o@@ zone . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would delay the observ@@ ance of one year to give his authority more time to study the plan , and to avoid &quot; interfere with local decisions or im@@ pe@@ de economic growth . &quot; &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was appointed Prosecutor of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a before his appointment , was a reliable opponent of strict environmental regulations for a long time . &quot;
&quot; since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly gone over to block or delay regul@@ ators who oppose the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the most recent legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ eck regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
&quot; last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ al in Washington decided that the EPA authority sur@@ passed its authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce meth@@ anol . &quot;
&quot; in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ ff suggested that his revers@@ al in o@@ zone standards simply pushed the willingness of the EP@@ O to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards . &quot;
&quot; in previous administr@@ ations , the EPA has often not respected the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be indic@@ ted by groups of activists and others , and in an agreement to specify the date for the implementation , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in a regulation through judicial proceedings , and we take deadlines seriously . &quot;
we also take the law and authority that exists to us seriously .
&quot; nevertheless , the EPA statement stated that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use his &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available powers to ensure that the rules &quot; are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a broader revision of the o@@ zone rules .

the measure was not yet set up in the Senate .
&quot; the New York At@@ tor@@ ney General Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of the states , who had su@@ ed the EPA this week , said the group intended to maintain the legal pressure . &quot;

Tum@@ our celebrates 50@@ th anniversary of St. Hil@@ arius Church
&quot; 750 years St. Hil@@ arius @-@ Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche , the old cemetery site in Tum@@ lingen will be invited to a seren@@ ade on Sunday , July 16th , at 4.@@ 30 p.m. &quot;
&quot; whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius system is a popular place to stay . &quot;
visitors to the sixth Bene@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chanted by this powerful place .
the rescue and maintenance of the oldest building in the village have made friends and pat@@ rons of tum@@ ors a matter of their concern .
Walter Mart@@ ini emphas@@ ises : &quot; it is a unique village gem . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was first mentioned in documents in the Württem@@ berg@@ ischer urn Manual : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the parish church of Tum@@ lingen and the V@@ og@@ ler &quot; at Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
&quot; according to the pro@@ clamation of the document , on the Hill of Tum@@ linger , apart from the former parish church , there was also a noble courtyard to which the church or the patron saint belonged and not the other way round . &quot;
so there were people living there .
&quot; as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freuden@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , beside the lower village and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still to be seen today in the place of the village of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; &quot; mountain &quot; &quot; of the third , the man@@ orial housing @-@ centre of the village . &quot;
old maps dating back to 1600 are under@@ lined by these historical conditions .
the law of pat@@ ron@@ age originated from the early medieval equity law .
&quot; a gentle@@ man who built a church , endowed himself with a priest , remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this church . &quot;
&quot; thus , the right to appoint a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop . &quot;
there were three altars in the church and two bells in the tower .
the greatest of the two died on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly created bell rang the first time in 16@@ 92 , but later had to be handed in during World War II in 1942 . &quot;
&quot; in the Thi@@ r@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) , the windows were sm@@ ashed and the bell parts were stolen . &quot;
the roof was le@@ aking .
&quot; in 17@@ 96 , French troops en@@ camped near the church . &quot;
&quot; they broke out the pul@@ pit and church chairs , and used them as fire@@ wood . &quot;
remains of the church threatened to collapse in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demol@@ ished .
only the church tower was left standing .
&quot; in the New Year &apos;s Eve in 18@@ 34 , a storm split into the church tower and half of them collap@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demol@@ ished . &quot;
only the existing tower was preserved as a witness of the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
&quot; today , Horst K@@ all@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em maintain the Hil@@ arius system as the successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn as successor to Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn . &quot;
&quot; as organizers , the friends and promot@@ ers charge Tum@@ lin@@ gens on Sunday , July 16 , to the sixth seren@@ ade to the old cemetery to St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ Chapel . &quot;
this is done by the com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freuden@@ stadt and with contributions by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
head@@ master Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann speaks the final word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is from 3 : 30 p.m .
the seren@@ ity of the seren@@ ade takes place in front of the cemetery .
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view of meadows down to the forest , &quot; the organizers provide the fantastic views . &quot;
the seren@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organizers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius system which is of importance for tum@@ ors and hearing @-@ gather@@ ers .
friends and promot@@ ers of tumours feel particularly committed to home care as Ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Mart@@ ini re@@ affir@@ ms .
association wants to let approval of wind turbines be checked
&quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim refuses to &quot; see no legal pre@@ condition for the construction , and has therefore turned to the Council of Agriculture . &quot;
the Bo@@ is@@ heim Foundation has called on Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette .
it is illegal .
&quot; the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval , no wind turbines could have been approved at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 , since at the time in Vier@@ sen there was only a wind force concentration zone in Vier@@ sen on the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal . &quot;
&quot; within this concentration zone , the construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes the exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city . &quot;
such zones are intended to prevent &quot; spar@@ ing &quot; the landscape .
&quot; the city of Vier@@ sen had decided only a few days before by a change in the land use plan , a second wind force concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette - but which did not appro@@ ve the district government of Düsseldorf , because of a fault . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of planning legal requirements , the granted permit is still un@@ lawful and therefore to decline , &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , president of &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the current state of affairs : before the summer break , the city council once again decided to enter the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette ; approval by the district government is still pending . &quot;
&quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; in this way , the issu@@ ance of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is legally excluded . &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of the invitation .
&quot; the relevant letter has been received from the Vier@@ sen district since last week , &quot; &quot; explained a speaker . &quot;
the circle takes it for the occasion to examine the matter again .
&quot; however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped . &quot;
&quot; in view of ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to cont@@ end with the argument of the &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; association . &quot;
&quot; the NEW Re , a NEW subsidiary , plans to build four 200 metres high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot;
&quot; last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen was indirectly involved , closed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hect@@ are site . &quot;
&quot; with the construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity consumption of around 11 400 households is expected to be covered - roughly one @-@ fifth of the electricity needs of all four households . &quot;
the NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros .
&quot; last summer , Vier@@ sen City Council gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind park near Aachen , as well as a stake in a wind turbine plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in Hein@@ sberg . &quot;
car and tractor crash together : woman dies in terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 am on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was injured in death .
two more persons were easily injured .
the provincial road remained closed for hours .
&quot; after police information , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch entered the L 3@@ 33 with her car as a companion with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother in the direction of Bo@@ gel . &quot;
city and merchants plan &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; -@@ weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ hagen and people from the region will re@@ discover the shopping possibilities in the city centre in September .
the commercial association and the municipal office want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 in order to attract the residents to the city centre .
&quot; as the chairman of the trade association , Christian König , announced the &quot; &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; &quot; weekend to sensi@@ ti@@ ze customers to what offers the private city has to store away from the usual super market goods . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market . &quot;
&quot; in addition , domestic firms should present themselves with their apprenticeship places . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre will invite you to &quot; &quot; midnight shop &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the action was not only aimed at residents of the city and the nearby region . &quot;
&quot; in preparation , commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bags , which point to the action weekend , so Christian König . &quot;
municipal management and commercial society cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
&quot; as a result , the trade association and the city enter into another stage of the &quot; Attrac@@ tive Center &quot; project . &quot;
&quot; this includes new offers such as the first &quot; Active day &quot; to the well @-@ established Brun@@ nen@@ fest , including sales Sunday , talks with all business owners and hosts , in order to move them to active participation . &quot;
also attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees this day are part of the concept .
&quot; in addition , customer potentials should be re @-@ developed or re @-@ developed . &quot;
this includes spa guests and tourists .
but many locals also lost the city centre while shopping .
&quot; in the end , everyone would have to contribute to li@@ ven the city centre - up to land@@ lords , businesses all over the city and clubs . &quot;
&quot; to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network , which partly spread abroad , King said in the spring . &quot;
&quot; Birgit St@@ reich , Head of the Chamber of Industry and Industry in Müh@@ l@@ hausen reported that the third &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; day , for the first time , took part in five Thurin@@ gian cities for the first time . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de . &quot;
&quot; the day should &quot; promote the appreciation of local trade and increase its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot;
the action led by the Chamber of Commerce of the Chamber of Industry and with many partners makes it clear that every citizen with his purchasing behaviour can influence his direct environment .

Tru@@ mp sat down after sa@@ un@@ ed tran@@ scripts from phone calls Mexico under pressure because of payment of the boundary walls
phone calls between US President Donald Tru@@ mp and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
&quot; on 27 January , Tru@@ mp in a telephone conversation with Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena Nie@@ to asked to publicly say that he would not pay for a planned border wall . &quot;
&quot; the US president compla@@ ined because he had publicly den@@ ounced the Wall . according to reports , he said to him , &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and s@@ wore to pay Mexico for the project . &quot;
&quot; tran@@ scripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published , revealing a ten@@ se exchange . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp said Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the United States that emig@@ rated to Australia was &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was medi@@ ated by the Obama administration would make him look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the reloc@@ ation of refugees to the United States .
Mr. Tru@@ mp termin@@ ates the call after having said Mr. Turn@@ bull &quot; this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ore Ford massacre : activists perform rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice
&quot; a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of spectators in rural Mon@@ ro@@ e , Georgia , and caught up on the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , which had four black passengers and a white rider , could reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with rif@@ les to block his way . &quot;
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a middle @-@ aged man in a con@@ i@@ fer &apos;s suit - took a long train to his ci@@ gar and looked through the wind@@ shield .
&quot; inside , the in@@ mates flew in fear . &quot;
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; the man ro@@ ared .
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ ams tore the silence when a young black man was dra@@ gged from the passenger seat .
&quot; fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on July 22nd , is only a follow @-@ up . &quot;
&quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; , &quot; almost all of them met with a very real si@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; since 2005 , citizens &apos; rights have come back to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com , as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - have been reli@@ ed from K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 . &quot;
no one has ever been indic@@ ted for murder .
&quot; it is really in@@ conceivable that in all these years not a single person was arrested - even though we see them in our churches , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps in the organization of post @-@ employment . &quot;
&quot; it is a stain on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gres@@ sman of the state of Georgia and a life @-@ long civil rights lawyer .
it serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ ro@@ e community that an injustice has never been corrected .
&quot; we want prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we need to get justice , &quot; he said . &quot;
we cannot reach healing and reconciliation until we get justice .
&quot; a for@@ en@@ sic doctor lays a sheet over the corp@@ se of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on July 27 , 1946 . &quot;
&quot; according to F@@ BI files received by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ ro@@ e and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the ly@@ n@@ ching process . &quot;
but no one has ever been indic@@ ted .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects have been on the open for decades , citizens &apos; rights say that double motivation for Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city has always been known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of the Supreme Court in Georgia made it possible for the first time to vote on the election campaign in the summer . &quot;
&quot; about the same time as the choice st@@ ach , according to the F@@ BI , the black Far@@ mer Far@@ mer , Roger Mal@@ com , a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , fell down during a fight - allegedly because of a woman . &quot;
Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ or in the city had been that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s &apos;s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she wore didn &apos;t come from her husband .
&quot; on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land owner , paid $ 600 to free Mal@@ com from prison , the F@@ BI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
&quot; but when they moved away from prison and approached Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , Har@@ rison , who has prepared and ordered the mur@@ ders , was a F@@ BI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in kill@@ ings , removing evidence and del@@ ving the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Broo@@ ks puts it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; it was a bal@@ lot massacre , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed in order to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; if you register and if you vote , this will happen here . &quot;
&quot; for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual reproduction of Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de . &quot;
&quot; her presentation is descrip@@ tive , po@@ ign@@ ant and is based in a kind of deep racism , of which many would like to believe that he no longer exists in America . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to watch and even harder to watch , but Gre@@ ene said that is the point . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch , because we are confronted with the ug@@ liness in us all , &quot; she said . &quot;
but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have done through .
&quot; the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest Black - pushed into a room and listened as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ene Co @-@ Director .
&quot; he has played the role of the chief executive member for years , but he said that the role will never become easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story alive because we don &apos;t want to return to these times .
&quot; on the other side of the room , actors Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester cries and ur@@ ges him , fur@@ ious that he has slept with his wife Dor@@ othy . &quot;
&quot; I said , n --- he van@@ ished from my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona rep@@ lies the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; Ras@@ cona asked . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; Gre@@ ene said , always ch@@ ich@@ ang@@ ing . &quot;
I just don &apos;t think that white people said &apos; n --- &apos; .
&quot; but , &quot; &quot; said one of the other black performers . &quot;
&quot; you only have to hit the hard &apos; R. &apos; . &quot;
&quot; and exactly there the energy moves in the room , a feeling of compan@@ i@@ onship replaces the discomfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy doing this right not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene begins again .
&quot; this time when Ras@@ cona says the N word , he says it sharp and with im@@ print . &quot;
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends violent and fast .
&quot; there are scre@@ ams , shots and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman , dressed in mour@@ ning , stands above the corp@@ ses of the actors and seduc@@ es Bil@@ lie holidays mour@@ ning praise to &quot; &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her voice breaks with every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it a group of about four dozen people wi@@ pes sweat and tears out of their eyes .
the audience is almost equally divided between black and white .
&quot; a couple travelled from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down only down the street . &quot;
&quot; they have experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as oppres@@ sive moisture for nearly eight hours , when Broo@@ ks carries her on a pilgrimage to the graves of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; up to this point the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , if one stands on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch Mor@@ de took place , the air feels ghost@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; when the last notes of the song fade out , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the corp@@ se . &quot;
&quot; children ho@@ ck at their heads , register the bog@@ us blood and the silent bodies and whis@@ per one another . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; a little boy mur@@ m@@ urs , as if he wanted to remember . &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ ch@@ sei@@ l and wipe off their tears .
&quot; Brad@@ sha@@ w embra@@ ces Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit that the clan member has played . &quot;
&quot; Nick Ras@@ un embra@@ ces two of his fellow players and breaks together in their arms , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks with him . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you did that for a reason . &quot;
&quot; later , the audience joins the actors for dinner . &quot;
a white couple from Atlanta gr@@ asp@@ ed at a table excited about the post @-@ position with a black pair that they just got to know .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky was struggling to find words that felt the performance .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and who do that , because they look like you , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what this really does with me makes me think that the ly@@ n@@ ching is still going on , &quot; she added , &quot; today it is called police shooting . &quot;
&quot; in the same room , Ty@@ rone feeds Broo@@ ks court at his table , he eats and recalls the civil rights . &quot;
he said he started planning the performance next year .
&quot; the emphasis is in a way inspiring , as it describes the horror of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is so , if we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ar@@ ma@@ ged@@ don &quot; &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bayreuth &quot;
&quot; in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf employs a colorful , fri@@ vol@@ ous staging in front of a giant , six @-@ storey cou@@ l@@ isse . &quot;
&quot; the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows optionally a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner with wall rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; &quot; Pla@@ ste and Ela@@ est &quot; &quot; logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; before that , an open Mercedes classic car park in which the Rhein@@ h@@ amm@@ ers pose as rock energy or alternatively an Is@@ etta . &quot;
&quot; stack@@ ed oil cas@@ ks remind of Cast@@ or@@ f &apos;s leit@@ motif - money , power and greed - that moves through his &quot; Ring &quot; production . &quot;
&quot; the three Rhine @-@ holders - sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke L@@ ehm@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ize as already in the &quot; &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; &quot; wonderful . &quot;

the audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause .
&quot; as a stor@@ my , Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , who mo@@ dest@@ ly and handed down the hands to the Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te , will be celebrated . &quot;
&quot; there is a big applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in casual casual clothing . &quot;
the performance of Frank Cast@@ orf and his regional team was eag@@ erly awaited .
&quot; in 2013 , he had to leave a holding conc@@ erto on himself , five years later , in which the single &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; calls went down . &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner looks forward to this .
&quot; you notice that the audience has grown together with the &quot; Ring &quot; in a certain way , &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot;
&quot; the audience did not only make a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it was also an understanding for his view . &quot;
I draw a positive conclusion .
Max lot works as a volunteer
they work at several places in their volunteer year .
where everywhere ?
&quot; quantity : normally in St@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture stock , once a week I will help in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge . &quot;
and I also worked at the school on an open day .
what are your experiences with it ?
&quot; quantity : it &apos;s a beautiful , wide spectrum that I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; they are now 26 years , thus a late @-@ professional volunteer . &quot;
how does that happen ?
amount : I have taken Ab@@ itur .
&quot; and then a civil engineering course , we say , successfully broken off . &quot;
I realized for myself that it is a wrong for me and I want to do something different to work with people .
and then I asked myself what do you do .
&quot; a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , in the focus maybe too , really . &quot;
and was it so ?
amount : I collected great impressions .
&quot; in the winter semester , I will start my studies in social services . &quot;
&quot; I will study dual , probably in the Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne a social worker training and study in Ham@@ m at the university of applied sciences . &quot;
is it not unusual to have several different places of use during the volunteer service ?
&quot; amount : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
it always depends where you are doing the FS@@ J .
it can be done from Alter@@ sheim to youth work - in all possible aspects of social work .
it was very varied with me .
&quot; I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care . &quot;
&quot; for me , this was exactly what irrit@@ ated me . &quot;
I was able to recognize my own strengths and see how it really works out .
unlike civil engineering studies ?

&quot; one always has other people in front of them , each having a completely different story behind them . &quot;
&quot; whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager , has been taken out of the family , one must always respond to it individually . &quot;
very interesting .
and you had no reservations ?

it is an area that gives a lot .
&quot; lots of love , lots of kindness . &quot;

&quot; Pear@@ son falls short of 3,000 jobs and abbrevi@@ ates the dividend to revi@@ ve the business &quot;
&quot; the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday that they will cut another 3,000 jobs and cut their divi@@ den@@ ds by 72 percent as another restructuring program will be started to overcome the pressure the company faces . &quot;
&quot; the job loss announced by the General Director John Fall@@ on for the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019 is in addition to its previous restructuring , which has already lost 4,000 jobs . &quot;
&quot; in May , Pear@@ son announced a third cost reduction plan to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ( $ 3@@ 94 million ) in order to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the fast pace to digital learning . &quot;
&quot; the company , which had sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to the partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann last month , said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged , after the first half of the year saw an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds . &quot;
con@@ voy ons@@ lau@@ ght of Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier killed in suicide bombing
&quot; a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in Kab@@ ul , Afghan capital , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , say officials . &quot;
&quot; five soldiers and an interpreter were injured , a statement by NATO . &quot;
&quot; according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians were killed in the incident in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district . &quot;
bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan had taken this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at on Tuesday .
&quot; on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul . &quot;
&quot; in a NATO statement it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening had happened , when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afghan army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; impro@@ vised jump &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all injured are in a stable state and are treated in the US military hospital on Bag@@ ram air@@ field .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in nearby Bag@@ ram .
&quot; according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties in Afghanistan during the first half of 2017 , of which 20 % in the capital . &quot;
&quot; at the end of July , a suicide car had killed at least 30 people in a predominantly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul . &quot;
the Taliban said they had launched this attack .
&quot; on May 31 , a massive bombar@@ d@@ ment in the center of the city killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack in the country since the US @-@ led troops pushed the Taliban out of power in 2001 . &quot;
&quot; violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp is considering increasing the number of U.S. troops supporting the military and police in the country . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , their policies and in particular in the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f Gh@@ ani . &quot;
EPA returns decision to delay the smo@@ g rule by col@@ lagen
&quot; the U.S. Environmental Protection Authority has made a decision to delay the regulation of the Obama administration , repe@@ aling what the states are obliged to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this took place one day after 15 states su@@ ed the Agency for its step . &quot;
&quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Oz@@ on@@ regulations 2015 &quot; , &quot; and said it signi@@ fies the commitment of the Agency to cooperate with States . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue and remember that we are responding to our state partners , &quot; said EPA leader Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; in June P@@ ru@@ itt announced the intention of the EPA to determine the o@@ zone regulations , in which in part of the country pollutants emissions must be measured in order to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 largely democratic states , along with the Colom@@ bian district , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tru@@ mp tried to return a wide range of environmental issues imposed by former President Barack Obama , as part of a broader agenda that is to boost economic growth according to Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; however , efforts have caused the set@@ backs of the Democrats and conserv@@ atives who are worried about the impact of major emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the EPA website says that inhal@@ ing air , o@@ zone contains &quot; &quot; reduce lung function &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; intensi@@ fy respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; such as asthma . &quot;
municipal council wants common room
&quot; in the end , the decision was clear : in case of two counter@@ parts , the municipal council of Flu@@ x @-@ Win@@ cken decides to set up a common room in the future retirement home . &quot;
&quot; prior to the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing piece of land was signed , reports mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; although it will still take a while before the church community has been part of the community , there is now no planning obstacle for the project to be managed by a private investor . &quot;
there is a discussion about a common room for this .
one of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
&quot; on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - approximately 55 square meters - and an adjoining terrace with a surface of 70 square meters for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the administration and majority of the Municipal Council were flo@@ ated to view such a common area not only as a meeting point for the residents of the sen@@ i@@ ent living , but openly in the church . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word &quot; &quot; kn@@ itting café &quot; &quot; made the turn . &quot;
the decision which has been decided by the provision of funds for the current budget last autumn will be offset by funding opportunities .
the building is located in the rehabilitation area .
&quot; the establishment of a common room would be , according to T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; the proposed suggestion for the investor to signal that there is no bil@@ let between the legs in this respect , the conclusion that both saddle - which is le@@ aning against the ambient housing - as well as a pul@@ pit roof - which reduces the drop height and the construction of economic power - would be possible . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less to say , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer writes , is this additive . &quot;
&quot; when it helps : unanim@@ ously , he passes the body . &quot;
it is not as easy as the common room .
&quot; Daniela &apos;s reputation points to the many of her own buildings , with which you can &apos;t get ahead so far , but now you rest at the common hall out of the window , she says : &quot; I &apos;m doing a hard job with it . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger is definitely speaking for the common room - but absolutely against a community involvement .
it sees behind it a hidden subsi@@ dy to investors who are already wealthy or even foreign investors .
&quot; this is not the case , because with the purchase of the area one does not grant a subsi@@ dy , but receives a real exchange value which is market@@ able in doubt , is the counter @-@ speech . &quot;
&quot; in the case of Sta@@ ir@@ ers &apos;s proposal to split the proposal accordingly , there are three advoc@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; so it remains with two counter@@ parts in the original program , which Stefan H@@ aller summ@@ ari@@ zes : &quot; if we take the decision , we make a huge step to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;
collision with car : Rad@@ ler is thrown onto road
&quot; when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist was captured by a car on Wednesday in Gar@@ eth , and was seriously injured . &quot;
&quot; as the police told , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was travelling with his bike on the bike path off the road Schwar@@ zer Weg from the direction of Hil@@ den . &quot;
the senior wanted to cross the road to the bush on the bush .
a passenger car driver in the same direction granted him priority .
&quot; when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder drove on the road , he apparently did not care for the counter @-@ traffic . &quot;
&quot; he met a car , which was a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ ess . &quot;
the man was thrown onto the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was transported to a hospital using a ret@@ ou@@ ge car .
Bayern Munich has to ab@@ stain from the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup doesn &apos;t take place without him : David Al@@ aba must leave the game against Dortmund .
&quot; with personnel care , FC Bayern is the first obligatory match of the new season to Dortmund . &quot;
seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the cup winner .
&quot; in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) , personnel worries are getting bigger at cup winner Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) . &quot;
coach Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti didn &apos;t have to do without the BV@@ B on David Al@@ aba .
the Italian confirmed on Friday .
&quot; in addition , Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing . &quot;
&quot; for the five defe@@ ats in the past six years , An@@ cel@@ otti did the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team . &quot;
&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , adding : &quot; &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot;
&quot; last but not least , this was not good . &quot; &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official obligatory match of the season .
&quot; football is also tac@@ tic , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot;
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; we want to play intelligent , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; difficult , intense game . &quot; &quot;

walking in the resin from star to star
&quot; in the Harz , the first &quot; &quot; star nature trail &quot; &quot; is to be created . &quot;
the association Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg is planning this .
there is a planetary pathway in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; Star Path &quot; &quot; is coming to meet the need for information of many visitors , called it . &quot;
&quot; it connects nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance . &quot;
the members want to set up boards along the planned route and inform about stars and star patterns .
&quot; in a first phase up to 2018 , the Association plans &quot; well at@@ tain@@ able installations in five to six locations &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; in question came St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber . &quot;
the information on the boards should be supplemented by internet .
&quot; therefore , a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of the site . &quot;
accessibility is a criterion .
&quot; later , the star@@ base train is to be extended by train . &quot;
&quot; the viewer experiences a lot of interesting facts on the star@@ base , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; the association explained . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors or why an ast@@ er@@ isk sh@@ one more than another , although it was much farther away . &quot;
&quot; also , in which con@@ stellation you find a selected star and when it is best to see . &quot;
&quot; since 2014 , the association operates the highest located observ@@ atory in Northern Germany in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany . &quot;
it is often seen from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a gal@@ axy with naked eye .
&quot; since 2003 , at the initiative of the Planet@@ arium Göttingen , there is something similar to the planned Star@@ wer@@ g - the Plan@@ etary Trail . &quot;
&quot; starting from Geb@@ hard &apos;s Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planetary pathway leads with its stel@@ ae to the H@@ ain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( Community of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
&quot; the stel@@ ae with the single planets - including the Plu@@ to , degra@@ ded to the d@@ warf Planet - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion . &quot;
&quot; the earth shr@@ inks to a bul@@ let of 6.5 milli@@ metres in diameter , while the sun at exactly 75 metres measures 70 centimet@@ ers . &quot;
the entire distance of the planet is about four kilometers .
&quot; while the light from Sun to Plu@@ to requires about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour up to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to . &quot;
&quot; thus , pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos . &quot;
but the march to the next fixed star would last half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ap@@ enko meet for the first time to discuss a possible show@@ down
&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ak@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a collision course to stage the most exciting race fight in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the defeated World Bo@@ xing Council Light@@ weight champion , went down the hall@@ way to greet Lom@@ ap@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing Organisation super @-@ weight champion . &quot;
&quot; after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ division world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday in Show@@ time , both comb@@ at@@ ants are members of the Top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ List . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia held out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; How are you , Champion ? &quot;
I wish you a lot of luck . &quot;
Lom@@ on@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga at 7 pm on Saturday evening on ES@@ PN .
&quot; when the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ on@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas observed that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a former fe@@ ather , &quot; recalls Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; I got up for Bron@@ er &#91; on 140 lbs &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to get down to lightweight .
and he must move to light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that would require the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ on@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxes need this fight . &quot;
&quot; Kli@@ mas asked if it was to be on Pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ap@@ enko must fight with a 135 pound debut this year , in order to arrange a date with Gar@@ cia in the next summer ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell . &quot;
&quot; this fight could take place in the pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all the fans asked him , &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said , and later openly expressed himself openly to fight on the network that offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ...
&quot; Gar@@ cia said he value Lom@@ ap@@ enko as &quot; &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; &quot; and he possibly will participate in his Saturday fight . &quot;
&quot; but Lom@@ ap@@ enko stayed with the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he thinks the three @-@ fight champion from River@@ side looks very slow , sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted the co @-@ off . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show striking strength , then boxes . &quot;
both said they could feel the momentum that was built up for their own struggle .
this is the struggle that must be carried out .
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been waiting for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot;
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four injured after tire plat@@ ters
&quot; in an accident on the A@@ 7 , four people were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; after the first information , the driver of an Opel Za@@ fir@@ a lost control of his vehicle shortly before the end of the market broad@@ band shortly before the end of the market . &quot;
&quot; the car dropped to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he over@@ came himself and then stayed on the roof in the green stri@@ pe . &quot;
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were severely injured in the accident .
&quot; during the first supply of the injured by the ambul@@ ance service , the A@@ 7 was blocked in the direction of the North for about an hour , then the traffic on the left lane could be passed by the accident site . &quot;
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; Drei@@ erk@@ ette works better &quot;
&quot; An@@ other Hoffmann hopes after the 2 : 2 season op@@ ener to the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig , that optim@@ ises the defensive formation in Au@@ e points . &quot;
&quot; with the first match of the season , Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied with the result even if not the two opponents were at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; these were two opponents too much , and we have to look better in Au@@ e , &quot; says the def@@ enders of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains the tri@@ erk@@ ette is to be further optimized .
and a gate after a clas@@ h won &apos;t want to catch the For@@ tun@@ en any more .
&quot; for the future , there will be no more than Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line . &quot;
&quot; Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better able to cope with the three @-@ chain in preparation with the three @-@ chain , than with the four @-@ chain . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know how to operate in Au@@ e , &quot; says his coach Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is confident of his thing , &quot; because we have just finished in the three @-@ chain at the half @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko Gieß@@ el@@ mann , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; the prerequisite is , however , that we harmon@@ ise even better and we do not afford to make so many playback errors under construction . &quot;
&quot; of course , also Hoffmann goes to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; but whether you can speak after a draw from a failed start , don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could be quite okay , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; but if we are at four points on Sunday and can concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to talk about a good season op@@ ener . &quot;
his trainer wanted to know nothing about this .
&quot; I judge the start into the season only after six to eight playing days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who would not want to speak of an advantage over auctions , just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be canc@@ eled pre@@ mat@@ urely because of a thunder@@ storm . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann that the Au@@ e players might even be a little fres@@ her , as they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a career progression in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t know where they are at present , &quot; says the inner def@@ enders of Fort@@ una . &quot;
&quot; although the guests from the Rhin@@ eland become a favourite place on Sunday in the meeting at last ( almost ) , stadium of Au@@ e . &quot;
&quot; that we sweep them away , just because we have the right to come under the first six is bull@@ sh@@ it , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive with only one defeat against nine out of nine games . &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , which you have to hit from the start , &quot; &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as &apos;s executive coach . &quot;
to make such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t .
and so Funk@@ el does not want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish asylum @-@ old application testing published
&quot; the recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , which have been subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the subjects tested are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish For@@ en@@ ic Medic@@ ines Agency ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) started the tests last year .
&quot; during the asylum procedure , they should make the assessment of the age more accurate when the Swedish migration authority ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) has been critic@@ ised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minor . &quot;
&quot; to date , Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et has sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 cases to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
ei@@ ghty per cent ( 2002 ) were assessed as 18 or older while in further 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; may be under 18 years old . &quot;
the tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results have been consistent over the past few months . &quot;
&quot; we see no big difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; he said to the magazine The Local . &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person was judged over 18 years does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied over his age .
&quot; in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there were 4@@ 42 cases suggest@@ ing that the presum@@ ed person was 18 years old or older . &quot;
&quot; when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det reviewed the results published 5@@ 81 , she noticed that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical age assessment , where x @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints are made , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , was also critici@@ zed in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a scep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work involves the assessment of the biological maturity of people in order to see if they were usually going through pu@@ ber@@ ty sooner or later . &quot;
I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used .
assessing the biological age in this way is very uncertain .
&quot; if we cannot say it safely , we should not do as if we could , &quot; &quot; he said to the Metro . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of having a child as an adult is small . &quot;
&quot; the biggest risk lies in the fact that if the person is under 18 , this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in the plan
the work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg is progres@@ sing well .
&quot; on Wednesday , a total of seven tons of heavy concrete were installed on the bridge at the east entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; we are very good at the time , it runs great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , forem@@ an at the Department of Road Construction and Transport in the District Council of Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April , the work began at the same time on all three refurb@@ ishment @-@ based bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
the construction end is scheduled for October and light is sure that the schedule is maintained .
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is a v@@ aul@@ ted concrete arch bridge , covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 metres . &quot;
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; like the two other bridges , it has now come into the years . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated . &quot;
the two other bridges lead over Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 metres long . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday morning , the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has received a 1,@@ 3m wide and seven ton@@ ne weigh@@ ted bridge on the north side . &quot;
this is a boundary fixation which is also used as a operating path .
&quot; on the southern part of the bridge , a width of 2.@@ 20 metres should be used on Friday . &quot;
then the pedestrian path is to run .
&quot; the special thing is that these are finished parts , a patent by Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ vin@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .
a special feeling of t@@ act has necess@@ itated the laying of lines through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable , connected to which many companies are connected . &quot;
the residents were informed about the project prior to the work .
&quot; in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; for the bridges between the building yard and the collective , in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated in a single lane by a traffic light . &quot;
&quot; for the construction on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach village entrance , the road is completely closed in the area of the bridge at the level of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the costs for the three bridge renov@@ ations amount to 700@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the whole thing is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : colorful protest with German potato salad
&quot; it does not happen so often that parties are pulling together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which is otherwise difficult to get under a hat . &quot;
&quot; the parties represented in the circle of volcanic Eifel ( CD@@ U , SPD , Grün@@ e , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Linke ) are part of a broad alliance that flies peac@@ efully on this day because the Af@@ D invites to the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Hall R@@ ond@@ ell to the loud &quot; &quot; big election campaign &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the leading duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the deputy chief of the Austrian Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; but those who are on site hours before the start of the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ eag@@ les , but demonstrate . &quot;
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot;
&quot; originally the city picnic under the motto &quot; &quot; All at a table &quot; &quot; was planned on the well square , but is now on the parking below the Ro@@ un@@ del - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle . &quot;
a colorful picture that offers itself .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chair@@ woman of the forum One World and one of the leading organizers , is really happy : &quot; great , how many people came together here . &quot;
&quot; there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; German potato salad , which the Af@@ D might eat easily , &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot;
&quot; the police ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing presence mainly at the station , which is only a few meters away from the venues . &quot;
how has the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
&quot; Mario Hom@@ pe reports from the Af@@ D vul@@ can@@ ic Eifel , he took care of such an event and received the supplement . &quot;
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us church there were not enough parking places . &quot;
&quot; so now the Ro@@ un@@ del , Hom@@ pe is pleased that &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he says : &quot; this is the good right of people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; there is also a band for entertainment at about 8@@ pm on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz forec@@ our@@ t , in the Stadthalle various speakers , including the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Af@@ D Chairman Uwe Boy . &quot;
&quot; in the hall there are about 200 listeners who wait for the top candidate to hold talks for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the deputy chair@@ person Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; the police presence , but until now , the officials had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; the Af@@ D event takes a little more than an hour , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is time to clean up after 21 o &apos;clock . &quot;
the police can back - no special incidents .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
&quot; a re@@ union with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli can be found in the series &quot; &quot; Has@@ la@@ cher Kloster@@ konz@@ erte &quot; &quot; tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 p.m. in the Kloster Church . &quot;
&quot; together with the Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; meets a classical German training with roots in brass music . &quot;
both solo@@ ists are winners and prize winners of numerous international competitions and have held sol@@ opo@@ si@@ tions in European top orchest@@ ras .
&quot; Pet@@ kov is solo@@ ist at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam , and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is solo@@ ist of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra . &quot;
&quot; both unite the desire not only to cross the borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres . &quot;
&quot; Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new gu@@ ise , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &apos;s &quot; world music &quot; unites with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz musician N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classical , jazz and free play blend into a fascinating total art@@ works . &quot;
this cent@@ re@@ piece of the program was premi@@ ered this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher monastery church with its special acoustics is consciously included into the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their life .
&quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart completely openly about their bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; when I bite into grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood star was the &quot; &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who ultimately dealt bit@@ terly . &quot;
&quot; in spite of all this , the brun@@ ette Dar@@ stell@@ erin is assured of the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Ba@@ z@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was in love with every serious guy I &apos;ve ever had . &quot;
&quot; or do you think , I would have played it ? &quot;
&quot; after their separation , Kri@@ sten insi@@ sted that they were bis@@ exual : &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed the du@@ alism . &quot;
so it has never been confused or hin@@ dered .
I just never liked being taken seriously .
&quot; especially among them , she said &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; but at school time when she dressed like a boy : &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
this really hurt me very much .
&quot; when I was eleven , the children told me that I would look like a boy . &quot;
&quot; I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed . &quot;
&quot; now I look back and think : &apos; girls , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
&quot; especially the public do not like to explain their love life : &quot; &quot; people expect you to be in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me . &quot;
&quot; and perhaps some call me ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself before the whole public . &quot;
the governor of West Virginia announced that he will change the party
&quot; the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Tru@@ mp that he will change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and much reflection ... today I will say to you as a resident of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the re@@ public@@ ans , &quot; &quot; added Justice . &quot;
as a coach I would say it &apos;s time to play another game .
Mr. Tru@@ mp first promised a HU@@ GE announcement at the West Virginia R@@ ally .
Mr. Tru@@ mp won West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
&quot; according to For@@ bes , Justice , which is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; For@@ bes states that he possesses coal mines in five states , and inherited a coal store from his father . &quot;
it is worth approximately $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
&quot; in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee issued a statement on Thursday evening in which it said : &quot; &quot; the party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party which would rather prevent us from working on it to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative corporations in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is from top to bottom without leadership and is not able to find a positive , uni@@ fying message , &quot; said the R@@ NC leader Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News . &quot;
Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal
&quot; the worldwide leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as obvious ap@@ ology from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed . &quot;
Russian athle@@ tics boss D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF congress on the eve of the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships that the ban@@ ishment of his country was correct from the sport and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; he said it was sorry for &quot; &quot; all athletes , who were caught up in competitions of gold and silver medals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; despite his comments , the IA@@ AF congress agreed to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) had found evidence of state @-@ funded dop@@ ing in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer to this day , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e to re@@ porters . &quot;
the entire Council and the entire Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has recognized in itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed .
Co@@ E said he was also &quot; delighted &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re@@ introduction .
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think that progress has been made , but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to re @-@ use Russia , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
we need to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation .
&quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships , which begin on Friday in London , according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors . &quot;
&quot; the head of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia had to meet some of the criteria for re @-@ setting . &quot;
&quot; drug tests are still insufficient and prohibited trainers are still vac@@ ant , he told re@@ porters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot;
funeral procession for soldiers cut off in Mali
&quot; during a funeral celebration in the North @-@ Hessen town of Frit@@ z@@ lar , around 1000 people of the two soldiers arrived in Mali with a helicopter crash . &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security arrangements .
Minister Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing about the un@@ resolved issue of defence .
&quot; they described the two up@@ turned pilots , however , as &quot; bene@@ fici@@ aries of their field . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bow down to this highest sacrifice which they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ s@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen came to life on Wednesday one week ago in the West African Mali .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a watch of the Bundes@@ wehr in the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Cathedral St. Peter .
&quot; at noon , only the members of the church took leave of the church . &quot;
&quot; then began the funeral service in the circle of the family , closest friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr as well as politics . &quot;
&quot; among them were H@@ ess@@ ens &apos;s Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) , and the general inspec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er . &quot;
&quot; grape @-@ branches laid down roses , the relatives stood arm in arm at the coff@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; in front of the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a screen . &quot;
&quot; Minister of Defense of the Le@@ yen called the &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; soldiers as &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; and a sat@@ anic journey . &quot;
the Stab@@ s@@ aup@@ t@@ mann designed the flight operation of the fighter helicopter Tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tig@@ ers of his regi@@ ment .
&quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the regi@@ ment to which the soldiers belong , declared : &quot; if this occupation could not turn the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot;
&quot; at the UN mission in Mali , Minister of the Le@@ yen didn &apos;t show that the use was dangerous . &quot;
&quot; but he is also of great importance &quot; &quot; for a country from which we are only separated by two states , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; after the funeral , the coff@@ ins were taken out of the cathedral . &quot;
&quot; when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information . &quot;
Prince Hen@@ rik wants no grave beside his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death . &quot;
that shared the royal house on Thursday .
&quot; traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the cathedral church of Ros@@ kil@@ de . &quot;
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
&quot; the Queen agreed with her husband &apos;s decision , she said in the message . &quot;
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried is still unclear .
but he does not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would have liked to become king .
in 2016 he retired and also retired the title of &quot; Prince &apos;s Su@@ pper . &quot;
&quot; since Hen@@ rik has not received the title and function he wanted , he does not see himself as equivalent to his wife - not after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the leader of the Danish roy@@ alty . &quot;
&quot; where the last resting @-@ place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , is still unclear . &quot;
&quot; but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the country he has worked for over the last 50 years .
&quot; Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French nobility , met Mar@@ gre@@ the in London in 1965 . &quot;
he worked on the Th@@ ames in the French embassy .
&quot; during his later wife &apos;s sympathy , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy standing in his nearly 50 @-@ year reign with the Dan@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik wrote about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did critici@@ zes . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was stag@@ gering , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stock@@ ings instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation here to be the mark of society @-@ critical intellectuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed .
there were two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants spe@@ edy re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; Dutch Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is after the loss of red @-@ green government majority for a spe@@ edy re @-@ election of the country , but does not want to res@@ ign . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , he was speaking for the resolution of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; previously , the surprising withdrawal of a Green party from its Land@@ tag fraction in Lower Saxony threw the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis . &quot;
&quot; five months before the official deadline for the Parliament elections , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its scar@@ ce majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the former Green MP El@@ ke T@@ westen set up its step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the election in its constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ ü@@ mme ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover . &quot;
group leader Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants his Group to commen@@ ce it .
&quot; with that , CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony State Parliament , SPD and Green 68 seats . &quot;
&quot; until now , the relationship has been revers@@ ed . &quot;
the new Land@@ tag will be officially selected on 14 January next year .
&quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said , the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether to continue to rule in this situation without a majority . &quot;
&quot; however , Stephan Wei@@ l holds it indispensable that the Parliament decides as soon as possible its self @-@ dissolution . &quot;
the CD@@ U faction is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the state constitution also envis@@ ages the possibility that the Parliament &apos;s parliament draws confidence and chooses a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; our constitution offers several options . &quot;
&quot; these opportunities must be legally cleaned , &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; all questions will be discussed in peace , if they are legally audi@@ ted . &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ western &apos;s step &quot; but something curious . &quot;
the politicians themselves stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
she called herself a follow@@ er of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called for the back@@ sliding de@@ pu@@ ties to return to their land convention .
&quot; we assume , of course , that they have returned to their land convention , which they have received over the green country list , with immediate effect , &quot; said the chairman Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; said S &amp; D Group president , Anja P@@ iel : &quot; &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ ests exceedingly . &quot;
she consciously decided not to pron@@ ounce any pron@@ unciation in the faction .
&quot; even against the background that there were no differences in content , we cannot understand this step . &quot;
SPD Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the takeover of the Dutch Gre@@ ens Euro MP El@@ ke T@@ ests at the CD@@ U as treas@@ on .
&quot; the behaviour of the former Green Party members in Lower Saxony is not only a betra@@ yal of voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; wrote the Federal Social Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly elect the Land@@ tag .
the exit of T@@ west costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; the politi@@ cian in her final vanity and in her fru@@ stration her personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; critic@@ ised SPD Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot;
it &apos;s a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony carries out this dirty intri@@ gue game and tries to make political capital from it .
Nieder@@ sachsen &apos;s CD@@ U leader Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his MEPs to include El@@ ke T@@ ests in the CD@@ U .
&quot; the president of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , accused T@@ ests of fal@@ si@@ fying the outcome of the parliamentary election in 2013 with personal career gifts . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U was at that time the strongest force in the SPD , SPD and Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority of one vote in the parliament . &quot;
&quot; agriculture ministers in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from gyp@@ sum , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany discusses contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal have happened ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
&quot; in an interview with the editorial network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) , Minister of Agriculture , Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) , is talking and responding . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Schmidt , How can the consumer protect himself from pois@@ oned eggs ? &quot;
I can only encourage all consumers to check the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp pressure .
&quot; on the consumer protection portal www.@@ feeding war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states present the latest information about the affected eggs . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if , after all , what we currently know is a health hazard virtually impossible . &quot;
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs get out of the offer - because the central role of the clari@@ fier is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the Länder .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has immediately switched off and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of Germany &apos;s concerns . &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
retailers are just the same as manufacturers to ensure that the sold products are market@@ able and harmless to health .
&quot; if the average maximum content of 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are non @-@ transfer@@ able . &quot;
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time not the factories are to blame .
are production plants and consumers sit in the same boat ?
&quot; according to current knowledge , the production companies are not directly liable . &quot;
&quot; rather , due to the presum@@ ed illegal practices of service companies , they have to reck@@ on with economic damage . &quot;
&quot; as always , there are too few controllers in the seri@@ ousness . &quot;
is it lacking only on the staff or in the conclu@@ sive jurisdiction ?
but it was precisely the official controls that have revealed the process .
&quot; the truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out as 100 percent . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a consistent clari@@ fication of such events and hand@@ ing over to the prosec@@ utor in the cases in which crimes can be submitted is crucial . &quot;
I have already made it clear that I expect a complete clari@@ fication of the responsible authorities .
is regular alarm mis@@ m really necessary in food sc@@ and@@ als ?
consumers have the right to only get safe and market@@ able foods .
&quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly ou@@ tra@@ ged . &quot;
&quot; through the pan@@ eled means , manufacturers , dealers and consumers get into a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; basically , it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ delivering animals is not acceptable and must be terminated immediately . &quot;
this must be worked consistently and with high pressure on all levels .
&quot; I expect all relevant authorities , that the facts will be solved quickly and comprehen@@ sively . &quot;
how the Financial Stat@@ ements of Football Imp@@ act on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Mo@@ ving to Paris
&quot; the rules , aimed at preventing un@@ hin@@ dered issues of European football clubs , will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s world record transfer from Spain to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main . &quot;
&quot; any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main of UEF@@ A , as the leading organization that over@@ sees the European game has the power to for@@ bid cre@@ ws from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial Fair Play rules , launched in 2011 by the UEF@@ A , mean that PS@@ G has to prove that the transfer from N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million dollars ) to extract the Brazi@@ li@@ ans from their contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s move to France .
&quot; PS@@ G can certainly make the money loose , so that N@@ ey@@ mar is under@@ writing and bringing it into a gal@@ axy of other stars , given the funding of the team by the power rich ruling family of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money for the acquisition of players , but must be subject to legitimate income sources enabling them to make the break @-@ even point in their football @-@ related business . &quot;
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A president in 2007 .
&quot; the former French player believed that clubs , who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success , effectively che@@ at and ris@@ ked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdraw their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentration on the debt of clubs to monitoring their losses . &quot;
&quot; the change meant that the business model , which originally used Roman Abr@@ am@@ ovi@@ ch in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder matter . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year lease period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million . &quot;
&quot; and although Plat@@ ini fell from the pres@@ idency in dis@@ grace in 2015 , his successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to sc@@ are off excessive spending . &quot;
&quot; certainly FF@@ P is not dead and we will certainly intensi@@ fy the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P over the past week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for invo@@ icing over the duration of its contract . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the revenues for the next five years can be accounted for at EUR 4@@ 4.4 million in the annual financial statements . &quot;
&quot; the first wave of EU sanctions in 2014 has hit PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the he@@ avi@@ est sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( then 82 million dollars ) , which later dropped to EUR 20 million - and it was ordered that the team members for the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players . &quot;
UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could attempt to over@@ list their financial supervision by blowing up their income by companies associated with the owners of a club .
&quot; while a Catalan company could sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , UEF@@ A would not be considered legitimate . &quot;
exactly that happened in 2014 when UEF@@ A decided that the sponsor of the P@@ SA was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that a portion of PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come to Qatar via payments from the 2022 World Cup organising committee .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have disputed that N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s World Cup ambassador is going to be an easy finding out for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators .
&quot; the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will be even more attentive , every effort to ignore the rules . &quot;
&quot; UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , on Thursday the people familiar with the situation . &quot;
they spoke of the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press as they were not authorized to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a turnover of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of 54@@ 2.4 million euros .
the accounts for the last financial year have to be published .
&quot; PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals , merchan@@ dising and tri@@ cot sales . &quot;
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signature .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players going to see and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s move by claiming that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P .
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; said the President of La League , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS with regard to Qatar &apos;s final ownership of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al @-@ Manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose society is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La League against a state financed by an association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; as soon as a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it is very difficult to respect the financial fair@@ play because one can go different ways or have different interests , if a country has such a big player to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss Life in search of a new chim@@ ney supplier
&quot; over the past few years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y has made board chocolate for Swiss . &quot;
now the sweet collaboration is at a possible end : the airline is re@@ writing the order .
Swiss speaker Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed on request of the news agency s@@ da a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; from Friday .
&quot; according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 . &quot;
the products would be insp@@ ected every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; we are very happy with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the spokes@@ woman . &quot;
around 17 million small red and white packed g@@ og@@ g@@ ite panels spread over 14 grams a year before landing to the passengers .
Swiss did not want to provide any information on the costs .
&quot; according to &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz , &quot; industry insi@@ ders estimate the volume of order according to &quot; Nor@@ thwest Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary produces an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs . &quot;
but more important is the advertising effect : for a chocolate producer it is a prestigious order .
Swiss will not be willing to disclose how many applicants are involved in the new bid .
but only Swiss manufacturers come into question .
&quot; according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y tries to renew the contract beyond the spring of 2018 . &quot;
&quot; for the s@@ da , the largest chocolate manufacturer was not available for a comment . &quot;
&quot; since 2006 , chocolate bars distribute the Swiss on board their flights . &quot;
Barry C@@ alle@@ baut has supplied chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g before the Swiss concluded a contract with the Mig@@ ros subsidiary .
&quot; the possibility to place the logo , Swiss introduced two and a half years ago with the start of the cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot;
the airline is working with different Swiss chocolate producers .
&quot; on long @-@ haul flights customers of First Class are treated with goo@@ dies by the confection@@ ery Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in Business Class n@@ apping passengers Sch@@ og@@ gi von Lind@@ t and in Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot;
&quot; also on the short circuit , Swiss Sch@@ og@@ gi of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y distri@@ butes both in Business and Economy Class . &quot;

&quot; also with the first attempt the Polish title defender , Pi@@ ot@@ r Mal@@ ach@@ owski , who raised 6@@ 5,@@ 13 meters , qualified for the final battle . &quot;
nostal@@ gia goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
&quot; this repetition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the 80 @-@ year characters , for the 90 @-@ year @-@ Gr@@ unge era ( as the pioneers David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter the Sk@@ etch @-@ comedy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 before their stars , such as Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd , went to bigger things . &quot;
&quot; as a cultural art@@ ef@@ act , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ enabled era of permanent memories . &quot;
but as fran@@ chise it feels like the time is short .
&quot; first day of camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not only because of his absurd humour ( it contained an original story for a speaking tin of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;
&quot; by sti@@ cking to the core of the g@@ ags - middle @-@ aged actors play great children , who will grow up - nevertheless , they managed to win the last part of the joke . &quot;
&quot; thirty Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults , who are playing adults now , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more after the watering can principle , including a riff on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90@@ s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le . &quot; &quot;
&quot; at one point , a character rum@@ mage through an Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from the year 1991 . &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the lov@@ able C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
&quot; and there &apos;s another crazy vi@@ cious P@@ lot in which Ron@@ ald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) is involved , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression of Michael Ian Black ) . &quot;
&quot; as always , the ex@@ ams are the best part of the fran@@ chise . &quot;
&quot; it is especially fun to see the eternal young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons &apos;s sub@@ li@@ pp@@ ies of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former big @-@ man @-@ on @-@ camp Andy now feels like an old cra@@ cker . &quot;
&quot; these are the moments of random del@@ usion that might appeal to this fran@@ chise as a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he reaches that which I consider to be his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose final scene will show the tapes of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon is now reminiscent of another kind of nostal@@ gia : the revival of the Cold War from &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with its East @-@ West w@@ rest@@ ling icon@@ ography . &quot;
&quot; the comedy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka with Rh@@ ys Thomas as a director is to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est fighting for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the road of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism . &quot;
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alogues are synchron@@ ized by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also an exec@@ utable producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English .
it is an ingeni@@ ous idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to watch ( the police spend the time watching chess on television as Americans might do it with football ) .
&quot; and the list of famous actors - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - brings out the voice for a decent game . &quot;
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so much involved in the ver@@ acity of a desperate propaganda drama - a killer who carries a Re@@ agan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single .
&quot; there are six long episodes , and the comedy is not fast or frequent . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , who has been edited to a lesser extent , could better deliver his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , since Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef are always visiting the American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two big men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot;
the message for the imagined communist public is that Western culture can do everything for money .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and with thei@@ rs .
impact on drugs ma@@ fia in the country
the police have succeeded in a strike against the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on Wednesday morning in the Black Forest Ba@@ ar circle , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Constance , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart many objects were searched , as the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office shared const@@ ancy on Friday . &quot;
&quot; fifteen accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years , and arrest warran@@ ts were already issued against them . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the officials ordered greater amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , as well as several hundred thousand euros . &quot;
&quot; in the case of simultaneous ra@@ ids in Italy , two persons were arrested . &quot;
against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans there were German arrest warran@@ ts .
the two are probably shipped to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators participated in the action .
&quot; in total , more than 300 police officers were in use . &quot;
&quot; the Ma@@ fia &apos;s members are accused of organised drug crimin@@ ality , heavy violence , attempted murder , rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office has been investigating the organised drug trafficking in Southern Germany . &quot;
between the public prosec@@ utions in Constance and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
&quot; for this reason , the large deployment on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo . &quot;
the aim of the investigation was mainly Italian citizens with close relation to the Italian ma@@ fia .
&quot; a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the bank account . &quot;
way large gaps in foreigners register
&quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not emerge &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the foreigners register in Germany has significant short@@ com@@ ings . &quot;
this leads to some serious wrong decisions in case of asylum procedures .
&quot; according to a media report , the Commissioner for Refu@@ gee Management , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , drew attention to large gaps in the country &apos;s central register . &quot;
&quot; defici@@ encies in the registered data could lead to some serious wrong decisions in case of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , &quot; warned in an analysis conducted by the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the data , ten million people with foreign nationality are recorded in the register , among them approximately 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries . &quot;
the data is therefore administered by approximately 600 foreigners in Germany .
&quot; since the data has not been sufficiently maintained , data quality in parts has not been good . &quot;
&quot; in individual cases , data were found in 1921 , &quot; of people who are no longer alive , or citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register . &quot;
&quot; incorrect data inputs can slow down revers@@ al processes , &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in statistics of people travelling to travel , EU citizens are also included , who would not have to leave . &quot;
&quot; however , such incorrect orders led &quot; to a distorted debate on how to deal with the exit of travel , &quot; that is , in the analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the Federal Government has apparently begun to send refugee families back to Italy with children under 16 years of age when they are entered there . &quot;
&quot; it emerges from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rück Newspaper . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the paper therefore means that the &quot; &quot; BA@@ MF lead &quot; &quot; such procedures &quot; &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and young children - again after Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , it has been practically no longer possible , so the newspaper has been referring to the difficult situation on the spot . &quot;
&quot; after the Dublin Agreement , it is responsible for refugees from the EU state that they first reach . &quot;
&quot; if a migrant travels to another EU country , the state can send it back to the country of immigration . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the ministry is now writing : &quot; in the meantime , the capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy has increased significantly . &quot;
Italy gave warran@@ ties for the reception and accommodation of family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) considers these commitments sufficient .
other EU states would also send refugees back there as part of the Dublin Agreement .
&quot; the domestic spokes@@ woman of the left @-@ wing group in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children thre@@ aten human rights of reception and a endanger@@ ment of the child welfare because of the lack of the Italian asylum system . &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood of people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach has already provided the blood donation service for other people .
&quot; at least from the twelve citizens , who were awarded the Friday . &quot;
&quot; Jürgen Gre@@ ski runs ahead , who now has 100 litres of blood with his 100 donations now . &quot;
traditionally the community hon@@ ors multiple willingness to don@@ ate blood at the Municipal Council meeting .
&quot; it is brilliant how our body is designed for it and we pay tribute to the don@@ ors who make their blood available to strangers , still un@@ sel@@ fish , &quot; under@@ lined Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; explained the coordinator of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , for the preserved foods are de@@ composed into their constitu@@ ents . &quot;
this is how three people could benefit from a blood donation .
&quot; at the same time , Mais@@ enb@@ acher reports of the actions carried out in the spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; this year , we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; said the DR@@ K Kreis@@ prepar@@ er Manager . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the change to the theatre house has led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago . &quot;
&quot; before that , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Stra@@ w@@ berry were among the multiple don@@ ors and were awarded for each 50 donated blood donations . &quot;
&quot; half as many re@@ book Herbert M@@ air and Dor@@ othe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ ro@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ mmer , Stef@@ anie St@@ oll and Uwe Vet@@ ter gave ten times each 500 milli@@ liter of their life juice . &quot;
the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
&quot; the Bank of England will probably later announce that interest rates will remain unchanged , after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened speculation about an increase . &quot;
the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain slu@@ gg@@ ish when it retained the interest rates on family income in the midst of an intensi@@ fying pressure .
&quot; the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members in this month to increase , as the weak economic growth weakened the support for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in its quar@@ terly inflation forecast , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on domestic income would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in the fall . &quot;
but it sign@@ alized that in the coming years interest increases would be needed to brid@@ le the inflation heated by Bre@@ x@@ it and she said that credit costs would have to rise more than expected at the financial markets .
members also voted to withdraw part of the Mam@@ mut economic package that was issued a year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
&quot; it will require time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial means for banks from the coming February , although it was said that it is now expected that they will provide 15 billion pounds in the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; the Bank said : &quot; &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , as pressure on the real income of households continues to strain consumption . &quot;
&quot; at the rate of interest , she repeated that &quot; a certain imp@@ unity of monetary policy &quot; would be necessary for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; somewhat bigger &quot; extent than the markets expected . &quot;
the markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; however , the bank asser@@ ted that increases would be &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; limited &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s growth forecasts for this and next year are expected to rise by 1.9 % and 1.7 % in May .
it maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the Po@@ und fell after these messages against the dollar and the euro .
the pound dropped by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 Euro .
&quot; the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ened the rising expectations of an increase in interest rate , and GDP in the second quarter increased from 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % . &quot;
&quot; growth is expected to fall by 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will recover slightly after the Bank at the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the latest inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households that are affected by rising inflation and marginal tax increases , as the tigh@@ tening first becomes worse before it will improve . &quot;
&quot; she added that monetary policy in the next few years cannot &quot; &quot; prevent &quot; &quot; the income statement , but she added that wages will be &quot; &quot; clear &quot; &quot; at the end of their three @-@ year forecast . &quot;
&quot; the economy is also strengthened by the increasing demand for British goods , which is attributable to the weak pounds , which will compensate for some of the lower consumption expenditure . &quot;
&quot; the decision comes after a year after the lowering of interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the lowering of the pounds . &quot;
the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years until this will fully reach the prices and the economy .
&quot; before the Bank &apos;s final decision on interest rates , the call for interest rates rose as inflation increased pressure on hard pressed budgets , with three polic@@ y@@ makers demanding an increase of 0.5 % in July . &quot;
&quot; inflation has dropped from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said it was expected to attract it again in the coming months . &quot;
the Bank said that the exceed@@ ance of its value should be attributed to the weak Po@@ und in proportion to its goal of 2 % .
&quot; said Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director of Cor@@ eco Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; &quot; in view of the recent down@@ fall of swap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive again , as the len@@ ders are looking sil@@ ently to shops and want to end the year in a positive manner . &quot;
&quot; the market sees particularly well for those in which the existing dealers are running out and the new mort@@ g@@ ages fin@@ alize , and many with toll @-@ free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot;
&quot; N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) to prescri@@ be 10,000 people controversial HIV drug &quot;
patients will receive access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment after a fight in front of the High Court against the financing of the drug in the N@@ HS .
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that a pre @-@ exposure proph@@ yla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) recorded before sexual intercourse , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now supplied by health service via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appe@@ al confirmed the Supreme Court ruling last year , after which the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the asser@@ tion that the local authorities should finance it . &quot;
&quot; the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England Chief Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as an &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; , &quot; while the National AIDS Trust ( NA@@ T ) described it as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to enable people to register , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 . &quot;
pre @-@ exposure proph@@ yla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV preparations that are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces HIV transmission in infectious diseases .
to take pre@@ p before sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs in the body of a person are available to prevent HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or as already two hours before sexual intercourse .
&quot; those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated . &quot;
&quot; clinics will identify suitable candidates who agree to the study including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot;
people who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also register for possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic .
the program will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week following an international competitive sourcing .
&quot; the study aims to evaluate the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting and implementing clinical evidence , as it is used in a large scale . &quot;
&quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot;
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in cop@@ ing with one of humanity &apos;s greatest health challenges . &quot;
&quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive Officer at NA@@ T ( National AIDS Trust ) said : &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ p , if targeted at vulnerable and vulnerable people , provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; from September onwards people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and is not subject to negotiations with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives . &quot;
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , Chairman of the Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; the priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind . &quot;
&quot; now that pre@@ p test medicine was procu@@ red , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , Shadow Health Minister , said : &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcomed and over@@ due following months of delay and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation by the government . &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug may be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transfer of this life @-@ alter@@ ing infection .
this experiment brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of pre@@ p .
&quot; now it is important that this study will be carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV @-@ infected , and that it will help us to step closer to the eradic@@ ation of HIV in society . &quot;
living the big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks transformed this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , shr@@ ank in 2014 from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne did not pack and sell her bags .
&quot; before that , I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot;
I looked for something comparable to my price .
&quot; I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings . &quot;
I fell in love with her and made an offer this day . &quot;
&quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot of the apartment has been completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
originally a one @-@ bedroom mansion with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Jo@@ anne &apos;s storage room and mezzanine should add to use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my request , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , she commissioned the architecture and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use the 12.@@ 5 foot high ceilings and to create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms over@@ lap so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating an intermediate floor in which one could stand .
&quot; Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively , in order to solve the requirement . &quot;
&quot; the steel works are rather complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stack@@ ed up , without having to bend down . &quot;
&quot; not only was it necessary to build a simple platform , but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama .
&quot; for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area . &quot;
&quot; mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; using mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
&quot; at both ends , a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to let it work longer . &quot;
&quot; in the kitchen , the mirror feels like a window in another room . &quot;
&quot; at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units offer space for all cutlery and glasses by Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used . &quot;
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering went in , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF @-@ door . &quot;
&quot; it is very important , so that when you push the door , it is very easy to slide . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day , you will sell the base - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on the floor size . &quot;
&quot; here , they have managed to increase the floor space while using high @-@ quality materials that give space to its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things that you touch and which help to create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t de@@ ar@@ est yourself into the electrical outlets in the walls .
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square footage of something standard in something quite amazing .
&quot; in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave them . &quot;
brothers fight for a 500 million US dollar real estate empire
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty in a dispute because of one of the largest real estate imperial Victori@@ as worth over $ 500 million .
&quot; the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and designer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and assets are to be divided . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp confrontation over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars , since the family bought a shop at Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood in 1973 . &quot;
&quot; there , the West@@ co family founded jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores . &quot;
it was sold for $ 85 million in 1999 .
&quot; this money has been invested in real estate , and De Lu@@ tis &apos;s portfolio now includes offices in the city center , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt . Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the suburbs . &quot;
&quot; following an agreement with her late father , Col@@ in is described by Paul as the &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third . &quot;
a court file states that this means that Col@@ in owns property worth $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul in the value of $ 17@@ 6 million .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; the divisions proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I considered the best objects , &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it . &quot;
&quot; last Friday , after several failed attempts , the first court hearing of the Supreme Court took place . &quot;
&quot; the brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business , of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims , expelled him . &quot;
&quot; col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but introduces Paul to manage some possessions in@@ competent . &quot;
&quot; in an early Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it , which was submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian inheritance says that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the costs are in the event , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and from both parties held law firms . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her dead husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , who ran dairy @-@ bars and delicacies from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties . &quot;
they used security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property where Col@@ in opened the first jeans shop of the family .
&quot; Col@@ in says that he began West@@ co there when he was &quot; &quot; in my last years of High School when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass on their property to her sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis Group , although Col@@ in claims that Mark was paid $ 10 million in leaving the company and Luke 26 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; both Luke and Mark are , so Paul says about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
Col@@ in has kept himself very reluct@@ ant even though he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography from 2015 Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire was the best friend of the TV star .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; just Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; I can really not say much , &quot; because the case is before the dishes . &quot;
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to su@@ e me and to draw our family name through the dishes , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
in the middle of 2016 Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; our father would not have wished that Paul and I would end up in our current dispute , &quot; he said , and added that he &quot; still hoping for a solution . &quot; &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our matter will be solved in the near future by the courts , &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot;
Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s new Chief of Staff is planning to limit the presidential press abst@@ in@@ ence .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
&quot; Politi@@ co reports that the White House &apos;s new Chief of Staff is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Tru@@ mp , including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a smo@@ other course . &quot;
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with executive employees on his first working day , he represented a major problem in President Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s White House , which he wanted to repair : poor information that came into the hands of the president . &quot;
Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information .
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense but others have tried to t@@ ame Tru@@ mp by monitoring its media diet .
&quot; President Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s relationship with television goes back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong . &quot;
&quot; when candidate Tru@@ mp was angry because of unfair coverage , it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of jobs that were to convince , &quot; &quot; said the former campaign manager Sam N@@ un@@ berg against Politi@@ co in February . &quot;
&quot; Politi@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key to keep Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s Twitter habit under control , &quot; according to six former election campaigns , is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . &quot;
okay . that &apos;s ok .
but the idea that Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter habit was ever &quot; under control &quot; is ridi@@ culous .
perhaps these fighting officials know something we do not know - that Tru@@ mp@@ s twe@@ ets would have included even more combus@@ tible material without their intervention .
we will probably never know anything about twe@@ ets that Tru@@ mp has not sent .
&quot; if his employees managed to stay away from him several times , then their efforts have been worthwhile . &quot;
but nobody has consistently managed to prevent Tru@@ mp &apos;s controversy .
&quot; part of the problem is that people in a White House that are composed of competing parties will always try to present their own agenda by presenting Tru@@ mp fabric , which may promote their views from the world . &quot;
&quot; Politi@@ co - busy with this story , reported in May about the preference of the advis@@ ers to supply the president with du@@ bi@@ ous information for strategic reasons . &quot;
this was an example described by Re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tru@@ mp officials say that Tru@@ mp can react like a volcano to negative press cuts , especially those with sham@@ eful le@@ aks , and that he tries to figure out where they originate from . &quot;
&quot; exactly that happened at the end of February when someone compla@@ ined to the President mali@@ ci@@ ously a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of Internet pro@@ voc@@ ateur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy Chief of Staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a bunch of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for har@@ ass@@ ment , or that he has not offered concrete evidence or that he has vo@@ iced false alleg@@ ations in the past and rev@@ oked them . &quot;
Tru@@ mp read the article and started asking employees about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; gold makers added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , have tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work that Tru@@ mp is receiving . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .
&quot; perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tru@@ mp is still his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors are still striving for influence . &quot;
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
most wanted criminals get mail from Euro@@ pol
&quot; as the address is unknown , the help of the population will be asked and hoped . &quot;
the police all over Europe are sending post@@ cards to dangerous criminals this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards .
&quot; since the addresses of the sought @-@ after s@@ words are not known naturally , information from the population is hoped and asked . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Euro@@ pol reported on the action followed by the winter &quot; &quot; Most W@@ an@@ ted &quot; &quot; Advent calendar . &quot;
&quot; the experiences would have shown that many fle@@ eting companies hide themselves on holiday destinations , called it by Euro@@ pol . &quot;
I have put together 21 post@@ cards for sought @-@ after criminals from 21 EU countries .
&quot; since 2016 , the website has been visited www.@@ e@@ um@@ bi wanted , more than 2.5 million times it has been viewed . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the online pla@@ inti@@ ffs could be arrested so far , at least eleven of them on account of the announcement of the publication on the website . &quot;
travellers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &quot; Million@@ aire Series &quot;
&quot; some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners in the West Mid@@ lands stand again with some determined travellers on the foot of the war , who negotiated a dig@@ ging from the community in order to rec@@ la@@ im a field in front of their man@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; the travellers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ avans on a field outside a prosper@@ ous road from Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; million@@ aire @-@ row . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they were thrown out in May without being deter@@ red by a dit@@ ch excav@@ ated by the Council to prevent their sei@@ zur@@ es . &quot;
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense posts and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; angry residents urged the council of Soli@@ hull , who said that it was &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot;
&quot; an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said , &quot; &quot; They moved there on Monday evening after they were sent on by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers @-@ by . &quot;
&quot; the Council must be forced into action by means of shame , as it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot;
&quot; the travellers were there in May , were moved on and are now back . &quot;
&quot; more came yesterday evening , probably even more today . &quot;
&quot; she added , &quot; The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long teachings to protect their parks . &quot;
I live on Stre@@ am@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my com@@ mon@@ place if the Council does not even stop it .
&quot; a local who didn &apos;t want to be called , said : &quot; it is ridi@@ culous , we have just seen the last round of these travelers just to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round . &quot;
&quot; the numbers have increased this time , and you have even seen a horse in the park area . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of the council of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps so that they can move on as quickly as possible . &quot;
&quot; to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible announce an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour with the police , calling 101 . &quot;
this contributes to creating an image of the situation where the court must examine when we proceed our case .
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof to Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof is the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the house in front of the gates of Freuden@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; because with the closure of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof by the then Ambiente company gesellschaft mbH on April 13 , 2014 around 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and revenue from the tourist tax was also lost . &quot;
&quot; in the autumn of 2014 , in view of dramatic rising numbers of refugees who came to the district , the hotel building was offered to the District Council as a collective shelter , which provided controversial discussions . &quot;
the city prevented the housing of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
&quot; at that time , the decision was not un@@ disputed in the council . &quot;
but especially Freuden@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian Os@@ s@@ wald defended the hotel location and spoke of serious interest in the house back then .
he should be right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels with managing director Birgit Sch@@ erer with its headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a home of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freuden@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
&quot; welcome to Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof has been building sh@@ utt@@ les in front of the entrance for a long time , and when you enter the house it becomes clear what extensive renovation works will take place . &quot;
&quot; the floors have been torn out , ceilings partly broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
there is still much to be done until March .
&quot; it &apos;s actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large walk@@ able showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed . &quot;
everything should later be &quot; beautifully bourgeois &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses .
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewelry . &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , wellness area and a conference room belong to the equipment . &quot;
&quot; one does not want to position itself at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on a up@@ scale downtown level , Sch@@ erer points out . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms wanted to spread wide , explained Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; he has already led talks with O@@ B Julian Os@@ s@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause , so sha@@ ver . &quot;
the performances of the city are identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; according to the amount of investment required , Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to determine exactly . &quot;
&quot; just under a million euros , he reck@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the exterior installations are also brought to the fore , which is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in a courtyard , there is a large terrace which is accessible from the restaurant that is open to the public . &quot;
&quot; Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; &quot; Freuden@@ stadt is a good market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ air : us Special Eagle sets up Grand Jury
&quot; in the Russia affair around US President Donald Tru@@ mp , special investig@@ ator Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report . &quot;
&quot; in recent weeks , the Panel has recorded the work , wrote the Wall Street Journal , calling on people familiar with the matter . &quot;
the paper read the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has expanded and intensified his investigations .
&quot; CN@@ N reported that there are already first alleg@@ ations of the body in connection with a meeting between Tru@@ mp@@ s , the oldest son and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
U.S. secret services acc@@ use the Krem@@ lin for quite some time to deliberately interfer@@ ed with in the 2016 presidential election campaign .
Mu@@ eller investigated whether there were agreements between Tru@@ mp@@ s campaign team and Moscow .
the investigation should focus on several men who acted as advis@@ ors to the re@@ public@@ ans in the election campaign .
&quot; according to reports , Mu@@ eller also examined more and more tru@@ mp private and business environment under the microscope . &quot;
&quot; a few weeks ago , the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote that the Special investig@@ ator Tru@@ mp personally moved to the centre and investig@@ ates whether the President may have imp@@ eded the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the wake of the affair . &quot;
the main task of Grand Jury is to examine present evidence in possible crime scenes and decide whether charges should be charged .
&quot; therefore , Grand jur@@ ys are also called &quot; &quot; In@@ dict@@ ines &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; most of the time , they are switched on when it comes to larger and controversial cases . &quot;
the procedure is always done behind closed doors .
the committee can also be turned on by the public prosec@@ utor to invite people to inter@@ rog@@ ation under oath .
&quot; according to the Sender CN@@ N , pre @-@ inv@@ itations have already been issued , which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tru@@ mp J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
&quot; people who were involved in the meeting were asked to testify , called it in the report . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they should provide documents . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Tru@@ mp J@@ r. , Tru@@ mp@@ s advis@@ er and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner , as well as his team Princip@@ al Paul Man@@ a@@ fort , were talking about this . &quot;
&quot; legal experts said on Thursday evening in the U.S. television that the sub@@ stitution show that Mu@@ eller would not be in@@ timi@@ dated in his work , and that if necessary , he would act quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the charge of an indictment . &quot;
&quot; however , the establishment of the Gre@@ y@@ um is the beginning of a new phase in the investigation and a new reason for President Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new revelations , the President , on Thursday evening , used a speech in West Virginia to portra@@ y the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents . &quot;
&quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; Tru@@ mp said . &quot;
the theme gives the Democrats an opportunity to feel good because they have nothing else to talk about .
his special Ad@@ visor T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in a statement that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury .
&quot; but this also works in secret , he emphas@@ ised . &quot;
the White House justi@@ fies any measures which accelerated the work of the special agent in &quot; fair &quot; ways .
former F@@ BI chief James Com@@ ey stated three times that he will not be determined against the president .
&quot; I have no reason to accept that something has changed in it , it was mentioned in the explanation . &quot;
but Mu@@ eller had only been employed after Tru@@ mp Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; because of this alleg@@ ation , alleg@@ ations against Tru@@ mp had become loud , he would like to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ey said in June in front of a Senate Committee , Tru@@ mp asked him to set up an investigation against the then national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n . &quot;
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
&quot; following the presentation of US media , the White House gathered material against the Sonder@@ fonds and its employees . &quot;
this triggered speculation about whether Tru@@ mp Mu@@ eller would be fired .
&quot; unlike an independent investig@@ ator of the Congress , such as the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair surrounding the later rec@@ alled President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired on the ur@@ ges of the President of the Ministry of Justice . &quot;
&quot; however , several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step . &quot;
&quot; two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic Sen@@ ators submitted legislative proposals on Thursday , after which the special investig@@ ator could no longer be dismissed so easily . &quot;
Antar@@ cti@@ ca : giant ic@@ e@@ berg drives in Antar@@ cti@@ ca
&quot; in the Western Antar@@ ctic , a giant ic@@ e@@ berg of the barely seven @-@ fold size of Berlin detached from the shelf . &quot;
this was confirmed by the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
&quot; the one tri@@ l@@ lion tons heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometers of large col@@ os@@ sus is now driving north and will probably need two , three years until it is mel@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; with a length of 175 km and a width of up to 50 kilometers , it is one of the biggest ice gi@@ ants that researchers have recorded over the past three decades . &quot;
a danger for human beings does not eman@@ ate from him .
the extent to which climate change has played a role in the demo@@ li@@ tion of the ic@@ e@@ berg is unclear according to research findings .
&quot; however , for nearly 30 years , there have been a series of unusual coll@@ isions of ice cream cones in the region , writes the US research centre for snow and ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in a background . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , this can be related to global warming . &quot;
the now broken down col@@ os@@ sus has been part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ven so far .
Sch@@ el@@ bö@@ g swi@@ ms on the sea and is fed by big glaci@@ ers .
it therefore continues to grow into the sea and breaks regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ven is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
&quot; in the north of this ice shelf , the equilibrium of wa@@ xes and ab@@ rupt was dis@@ rupted several years ago . &quot;
A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen writes a complete Sch@@ el@@ ven &apos;s event .
&quot; there is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ven is in danger , as the front edge has never pulled back as far as it is at present . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the ice sheet is under tension and can be broken if a piece breaks down at a key point . &quot;
the melting of ice shelf and ic@@ e@@ berg does not increase the sea level as it dri@@ es on the water and glaci@@ ers so much water as it produces after melting itself .
&quot; however , the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase the sea level , but only to a small extent , writes the British research project to observe Antar@@ cti@@ ca ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot;
&quot; according to A@@ WI data , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ven is the fourth @-@ largest shelf of Antar@@ cti@@ ca with almost 50 000 square kilometres . &quot;
&quot; at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean approximately 200 metres . &quot;
it breaks regularly there .
&quot; although it is a natural occurrence and no direct link to climate change is aware of us , the ice shield now enters a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the most far@@ th@@ est retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; he too confirmed . &quot;
&quot; scientists are controversial whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ ven will now grow back or go back in the long run , and possibly collap@@ sed , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man said , &quot; Our models say it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
&quot; even if these researchers fail to bring this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg back to climate change , the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has been falling apart during the last decades . &quot;
this long top of the Antar@@ ctic stretches towards South America .
&quot; according to the research program British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has decreased by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s . &quot;
the decline in temperature has contributed to this decline .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has war@@ med up around three degrees in the past 50 years and is thus one of the areas in which the temperature is the fastest .
CD@@ U wants Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f at the personnel
&quot; because it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill vac@@ ant jobs , the CD@@ U asks to leave the Emplo@@ yers &apos; Association to become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; only shortly before the summer break , 41 new jobs in the administration have gone through in the administration . &quot;
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
&quot; now , 17 trainees have left their first working day . &quot;
the apprentices@@ hips at the circle are obviously very sought after .
around 6@@ 20 applications had been submitted for the places to be awarded this year .
&quot; nevertheless , the circle continues to lack personnel to cope with the increased demands and challenges . &quot;
&quot; currently , there are still 50 un@@ occupied places in the M@@ ett@@ mann district . &quot;
&quot; among other things , the search for physicians and engineers as well as the forces of general administration are sought . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; according to the parties &apos; request , the administration will develop a concept for personnel recruitment and personnel development . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to not only cover short @-@ term requirements for skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented candidate shortage . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should orient@@ ate themselves both internally and extern@@ ally , outline specific measures for cros@@ sc@@ end@@ ants and include a training offensive , call for CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
this sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn &apos;t know before .
other cities adverti@@ se good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
the speech is from a regular &quot; competition of the public employer . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a high number of employees have to leave the service due to illness or age @-@ related reasons . &quot;
so it &apos;s time to take action so that no more places remain un@@ occupied .
&quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter Völker , group leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common application with his party . &quot;
&quot; already in the circle of the circle , he had caused a fist big surprise when he publicly challenged the personnel expenses and the remaining parties ba@@ ff@@ led . &quot;
people want all the possibilities to be reviewed which allow a withdrawal from the communal employers &apos; association .
&quot; if we do not come to a satisfactory solution here at short notice , the administration of the county with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - should strive for a tari@@ ff , &quot; &quot; people . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the CD@@ U tries to pay better the employees and officials than it actually fores@@ ees the tari@@ ff for the public service . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , increases or more money are only available if you change to a higher level that is oriented towards career years . &quot;
but the tasks of the circle have grown more and more over the past few years .
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Pro@@ stitution Act . &quot;
&quot; not least because of the rising number of asylum seekers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ rix and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff . &quot;
Italy tigh@@ tened the tone of NGO migrants
&quot; in Italy , NGOs who use rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean have warned that they are not allowed to continue this if they do not comply with new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; &quot; said Home Secretary Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot;
&quot; Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities confis@@ cated a boat from the German aid organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , because their crew had worked effectively with traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration . &quot;
&quot; the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for one year , refused to express extensive alleg@@ ations of the Italian prosec@@ utor Amb@@ ro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ sio . &quot;
&quot; we are so sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; said the organisation in a statement on social media . &quot;
we can only judge all accus@@ ations raised at present after we have collected all the information and assess the situation .
&quot; the Italian authorities had monitored the boat of &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , since October . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that its crew takes din@@ gh@@ y migrants on board , which are delivered directly by traffi@@ ckers , and that the smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can depart so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one such meeting supposedly took place only 1,3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the acts of the prosec@@ utor , whose content was published by Italian media . &quot;
&quot; the occupation is suspected of over@@ riding the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives . &quot;
&quot; under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats like the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta above all must have an Italian police officer who monitors their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs participating in search and rescue missions have previously agreed to adhere to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter announced on Thursday that the new rules would be deemed unnecessary , but acceptable as they would not bring any &quot; significant changes or disabilities &quot; to their rescue operations . &quot;
among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Prize @-@ winning organization Doc@@ tors With@@ out Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; in the meantime , Minn@@ iti has said that the number of migrants arrived in Italy after the rescue operations has gone back in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guards and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit . &quot;
&quot; in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe . &quot;
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
&quot; nine vision@@ ary bi@@ kers , the &quot; Berliner Out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the northern Pal@@ at@@ inate to enjoy tri@@ als and sight@@ se@@ ein@@ gs for four days . &quot;
there were three friendly guides available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and wine festival of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim on hot summer temperatures .
&quot; view@@ points followed , partly on towers , from which one could see far beyond the P@@ fäl@@ zer forest and the up@@ stream plains . &quot;
&quot; in between there was always a longer asc@@ ents , for the long tri@@ als rewarded . &quot;
&quot; on the second day , it went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to Sal@@ ine and to the folk festival saus@@ age market . &quot;
&quot; again , looking at the lookout point , connected by &quot; &quot; flo@@ wer@@ ed &quot; &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot;
during the last two days a lot of al@@ timet@@ ers were announced .
&quot; caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and refu@@ ges brought welcome breaks . &quot;
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers at@@ m@@ ete healing br@@ ine in the open @-@ air inhal@@ atorium .
Neu@@ stadt was also controlled .
&quot; after 17@@ 3 kilometres and almost 4@@ 500 metres altitude , the group met the P@@ fäl@@ zer Wald from its best side - athle@@ tic and cul@@ turally . &quot;
console instead of grass - Bundes@@ liga upgrades e @-@ sport
are the sports stars in the future sitting in front of computer consoles instead of swe@@ ating through the stadium racing with wind and weather ?
&quot; fact is : e @-@ Sports has long become a serious business , becoming a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gau@@ ges included . &quot;
&quot; the first federal li@@ ga@@ ver@@ sts , who are increasingly involved in this area , have also recognised this . &quot;
&quot; the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an E @-@ Sport department in mid @-@ July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 . &quot;
&quot; we hope to enth@@ use new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says managing director Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; he is sure , &quot; &quot; that there are still some clubs on this train . &quot;
&quot; next weekend , FIFA World Cup football club organis@@ es the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where the gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven qualified . &quot;
also Robin D@@ utt sees great potential in the E @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ coach of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; real football has to deal with the 14 @-@ 30 @-@ year @-@ olds , that young people will go to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and : the clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets , especially the Asian ones . &quot;
&quot; with prominent electric sports@@ men under contract , you could be more often present on these markets online than just once a year to send the German embassy to Asia . &quot;
what is it all about ?
&quot; during e @-@ sport , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or the football simulation FIFA champi@@ oned FIFA at a competitive level . &quot;
&quot; as in normal sports , le@@ agues have long since established themselves in which the professionals compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; and in the Asian Games 2022 , e @-@ sport is already part of the official programme . &quot;
but is it a proper sport ?
&quot; for many , the performance is certainly getting used . &quot;
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ bers has long been dealing with the question .
&quot; for Professor at the German Sport University in Cologne , e @-@ sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in the classical sport - for example increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes . &quot;
&quot; in addition , cognitive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and rapid response ability . &quot;
professional gam@@ ers ought not only to exercise on the console but also their bodies and pay attention to their diet .
&quot; the fit player is a good player . &quot;
but ac@@ rob@@ ats also have problems : &quot; dop@@ ing becomes more and more a topic . &quot;
&quot; checks are difficult for online games , and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing . &quot;
the scientist clearly highlights the high integr@@ ative effect of the E @-@ Sports .
&quot; players are on the move internationally , this is like a big global family , there are no cross @-@ cultural barriers . &quot;
a study by the management consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth in the E @-@ sport .
&quot; in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly through advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tour@@ neys . &quot;
&quot; in three years , sales are expected to reach 130 million . &quot;
&quot; against the almost 2.4 billion Euro of the Bundes@@ liga , this is little . &quot;
&quot; however , the E @-@ sport is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hockey , &quot; the Del@@ o@@ itte advis@@ ers write . &quot;
many countries are already on the international level .
&quot; major markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the US team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports . &quot;
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sports competition provider Uni@@ kr@@ at .
&quot; in Europe , too , things are happening . &quot;
&quot; in a Norwegian school e @-@ sport was introduced as a lesson , says ac@@ rob@@ atic . &quot;
&quot; in the Netherlands and France , the football league club clubs are meanwhile obliged to set up an e @-@ sports department . &quot;
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany is la@@ gging behind , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B @-@ CEO R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; to decay only in nostal@@ gia , and to extingu@@ ish the old times is no longer enough . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but to align the company at the same time on the modern market . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digi@@ ti@@ sed world , &quot; says D@@ utt . &quot;
you can &apos;t hold on to the fact that everything remains the same with football as it always was .

Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter sentenced to suicide by Con@@ rad Roy
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boy@@ friend through texts and calls to commit suicide .
&quot; Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her condem@@ nation behind bars and five years have been exposed to prob@@ ation . &quot;
Car@@ ter was sentenced in June due to the neg@@ ligent murder of Con@@ rad Roy who took life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing , &quot; &quot; My family is innocent . &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain vac@@ ant until his appointment .
&quot; she had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had suffered from a mental illness . &quot;
&quot; dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood there with tears in her eyes , with folded hands and down@@ wards , when she was condemned . &quot;
&quot; her actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; the prosec@@ utor said to the court . &quot;
she finished his life in order to make her own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she has not shown any regret . &quot;
&quot; but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful circum@@ stance that she completely regre@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; judges Lawrence Mon@@ iz , however , said he did not figure out that their &quot; age or maturity &quot; or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a prosec@@ utor had read a statement by Ro@@ y &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , saying that there is &quot; no day &quot; in which I do not mo@@ urn the loss of my beloved Son . &quot;
&quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything . I try to be there for his sisters , in spite of all my pain , which we will carry with us for eternity . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she would be &quot; persecuted &quot; by the realization that she would never take part in her brother &apos;s wedding or be a a@@ unt for his children . &quot;
&quot; no longer have this single person with whom I have been together every day since my birth , is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case appears to be a legal preced@@ ent , as there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to challenge another to commit suicide . &quot;
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
&quot; the case drew national attention , after Car@@ ter &apos;s text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; hang up , jump from a building , get yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; &quot; she said in several news that she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family . &quot;
&quot; in the moments before his suicide , she wrote : &quot; &quot; you have to do it , Con@@ rad &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; All you have to do is to turn on the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz told Car@@ ter &apos;s attention went through the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from the case by any press .
the case has divided the legal opinion .
&quot; one of the few who defended Car@@ ter was Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was convic@@ ted in 2007 due to murder of her British co@@ hab@@ itation in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter ear@@ ns sympathy and help , not jail . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ ber@@ ley : learning from the new Mini @-@ L@@ ahm of FC Bayern
&quot; that Joshua Kim@@ ber@@ ley was allowed to run as a captain at the Audi Cup , is not a coincidence . &quot;
the FC Bayern takes a big season to the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner - extra motivation does not hurt .
&quot; something was different on his seat in the cabin , which Joshua saw immediately , even if the extra piece of clothing was very , very small . &quot;
&quot; but as far and wide on the second day of Audi &apos;s Cup , of course , no Philipp L@@ ahm and no Manuel Neu@@ er had to be seen , he made a rush to his arm . &quot;
&quot; the coach did not say it , &quot; said the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner afterwards , after his first assignment as a Bavarian captain . &quot;
&quot; well , the setting could have run better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples . &quot;
but the character of the coach was able to interpret Kim@@ ber@@ k as well .
&quot; not the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal had been chosen as a game leader in the C @-@ El@@ f , consisting of youth players , de@@ but@@ ants and especially from the holiday . &quot;
it is prefer@@ able to distribute sugar to those who want to enter@@ tain a lot that you want to keep in a mood .
&quot; so , who was chosen to compete with the legacy of L@@ ahm , can only use a little extra motivation . &quot;
Kim@@ ber@@ ich confirmed : &quot; this is what you want as a player : take responsibility .
&quot; on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old flow@@ ed as a mini @-@ under@@ took over the field . &quot;
&quot; right behind , this is his position , the white band@@ age at the arm did her rest . &quot;
&quot; and in general , Kim@@ ber@@ ley looked like the one who can take the helm in his hand . &quot;
&quot; he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ well played tro@@ upe . &quot;
&quot; he had a look for the whole , while many others were busy himself . &quot;
&quot; Vi@@ dal thus manages to re@@ play his missing fitness ( hardly worked ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches thus , on the devil , come out to the achievements of Asia &apos;s journey ( also only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le do not neg@@ atively fall into their first appearance in the Bayern Tri@@ cot . &quot;
but all this worked quite well .
&quot; in addition Kim@@ ber@@ ich , Ru@@ dy ran off against the defense , both acted confi@@ dently . &quot;
&quot; the nam@@ i@@ ably occupied Nap@@ oli storm was often difficult , and Sü@@ le was also successful in playing the game a few times . &quot;
&quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy said that &quot; &quot; the result &quot; &quot; wasn &apos;t as we hoped for . &quot;
but he too showed a decent performance during the debut .
&quot; game reloc@@ ation , tempo change : &quot; for this style , I was also brought up . &quot; &quot;
&quot; how unusual this Bayern world is still for the newcom@@ ers , one soon saw the game . &quot;
&quot; for example , in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , Ru@@ dy did not give one or two , but determined six or seven interviews . &quot;
Kim@@ ber@@ ley said goodbye to his new fellow players after a few cris@@ p statements .
&quot; there he heard of Sü@@ le an interesting phrase : &quot; &quot; what is going on here , I have already noticed . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , you just have to win every game . &quot; &quot;
&quot; after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new . &quot;
Al@@ aba Moti@@ v@@ ates O@@ F@@ B La@@ dies
David Al@@ aba believes in the success of our O@@ F@@ B ladies
Austria &apos;s most famous foot@@ b@@ aller has reported on Twitter just before the game and wished the Ö@@ F@@ B ladies all the best .
the Bavaria @-@ Legi@@ onn@@ aire is practically club @-@ mate of Ö@@ F@@ B @-@ Kapit@@ än@@ in Schn@@ ader@@ beck and flam@@ boy@@ ed with our ladies .
the twe@@ et of the Austrian football team of the year and Champions League winner should be a special motiv@@ ating sp@@ lash .
the famous Bayern @-@ Dus@@ el might also need our ladies well .
company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ sing pace
&quot; it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate . &quot;
this is evident after more than a year in which the new Minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V request of a change in economic policy - and at the same time blame the old minist@@ erial council .
&quot; Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Trier Enterprises ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing acc@@ esses the desires of the economy , which Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot;
&quot; the largest turn@@ around , of course , is in the infrastructure policy : the gap of the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s priority list . &quot;
&quot; this year , the ministry is hoping for a planning process , until 2021 is expected to be the construction law . &quot;
&quot; in the country &apos;s plans , the West Bank also plays a role in the country &apos;s plans . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to take the route in operation in December 2020 , says Minist@@ erial spokesperson Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; nat@@ us sees in it a sign@@ post to support regional , but internationally competing companies . &quot;
&quot; as from Wis@@ sing , the Chamber of Industry and Commerce ( Chamber of Commerce ) stri@@ ves to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports since ten years . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , praise the Chamber of Industry . &quot;
&quot; the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier sees an additional incentive for young apprenti@@ ces in the new master bonus , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach . &quot;
a premium of 1000 Euro is fores@@ een for the passed master test and 2500 Euro if graduates enter self @-@ independently within ten years of the master &apos;s training .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; with the planned road construction , there are quick facts to be created ; at the same time it lacks the necessary personnel , says Jan Bell auer , the main managing director of the I@@ HK Trier . &quot;
&quot; to date , 56 new engineers who want to hire bis@@ sing in the state @-@ run mobility have only occupied 29 jobs . &quot;
the Chamber of Commerce calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
&quot; commenting on the calculations of the Court , CD@@ U , Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf , points to the calculations of the Court , the country invested more than EUR 20 million in 2017 and 2018 , less than proposed in the preservation of regional roads . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frank nat@@ us also anticip@@ ates a concept of the country as it wants to remedy the shortage of skilled labour in the region . &quot;
&quot; so@@ ber@@ ing , moreover , is the previous broad@@ band extension in the country . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , regional companies rated power supply in an I@@ HK survey only with a score of 3.4 . &quot;
they compla@@ ined about stagn@@ ant internet connections and break@@ through@@ s .
former Minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and is still in the Supervisory Board of wind power company Pro Wind .
&quot; the Green Group left Lem@@ ke for April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe , where she already cleared the field for four months due to discre@@ pan@@ cies . &quot;
&quot; Audi should change 85@@ ,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter reaction &quot;
&quot; one day before the announcement from Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW Group said the company believes that &quot; there are smar@@ ter options as driving restrictions , &quot; and thus moved to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - to prohi@@ bit or restrict diesel vehicles . &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the under@@ tak@@ ings as a recall .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support the compliance of rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; but nitrogen oxi@@ des , em@@ itting diesel engines , are considered carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma . &quot;
&quot; the cost of the car manufacturers to install systems for neutr@@ al@@ ising diesel exhaust emissions also increases , making it difficult to maintain the price of cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of indul@@ ging the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing the signs of the problem .
&quot; companies try to avoid Volkswagen fla@@ ws that could regulate the use of so @-@ called shut @-@ off devices that could regulate emissions to comply with the rules when a car was tested , but returning to normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several employees of Volkswagen were indic@@ ted ; others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
last month the former Head of Ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics in the engine development of Audi was arrested in Germany .
&quot; the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be tried in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi to have installed a system to handle emissions regulations in Europe , and a request that was concentrated on the United States was expanded . &quot;
the involvement of Audi in the investigation could seriously strain Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes dispro@@ portion@@ ately to Volkswagen &apos;s win .
this message has the raft on Saturday at the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
&quot; so that the Is@@ ar visitors join , on tomorrow &apos;s Saturday , a raft goes through Munich , which has a special message . &quot;
&quot; if you pass the Is@@ ar on the Saturday , there will be a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ Bridge . &quot;
&quot; and that &apos;s not a common raft , with Is@@ ar tourists . &quot;
but the building paper wants to clear up .
on the raft you can see a large inf@@ ot@@ ran@@ spar@@ ent .
it shows a rub@@ b@@ ish .
the pr@@ elu@@ de to an publicity campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; with the motto &quot; &quot; True Love &quot; ... &quot; the understanding of the Is@@ ar is to shar@@ pen as a protected game of game . &quot;
&quot; last summer , the raft drove over the Is@@ ar and also this year there are more actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behavior . &quot;
Mor@@ dil@@ los grow@@ n@@ oses and laughter against the suffering
&quot; at times , Mor@@ di@@ llo was one of the most publi@@ ci@@ zed carto@@ ons of carto@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; even with 85 , the Argent@@ inian still draws and works on a film . &quot;
&quot; his message : &quot; &quot; laugh , &quot; &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
&quot; in the first years as an artist , he was among other things a drau@@ gh@@ ts@@ man for greeting cards - which led him to fru@@ strate . &quot;
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; after the stations in Lima , New York and Paris , he made a breakthrough at the end of the 1960s : with the release of his carto@@ ons in Paris Match and then in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
again and again the artist was inspired by cities .
&quot; large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo figures cav@@ ort in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning , according to his own statements , he is still on the drawing table , works almost ten hours a day . &quot;
&quot; over cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and clo@@ cks , his dro@@ ll figures continue to spread worldwide . &quot;
&quot; for six years , he has been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters . &quot;
&quot; the main character in the film &quot; &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los any beast in his drawings - who has a jack for exchange as a counter player . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , his figures in the 3D film , which are supposed to come to the cinema screen in 2019 . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot;
the script is not written by him .
&quot; this is why he relies more on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced without wor@@ rying . &quot;
Lav@@ ender from Provence threatened by climate change
&quot; it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened with climate change . &quot;
&quot; la@@ ven@@ der is declining because of the conditions that are reminiscent of drought and due to diseases transferred insects , leading scientists and farmers trying to find solutions , large head@@ aches are prepared . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , Expert of the CRI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M agricultural research institute in Provence , said : &quot; &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change over the past few years , which in the spring has brought much less rain and in autumn much more . &quot;
this has effects on the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
&quot; there is also a small zi@@ k@@ ade , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its d@@ warf @-@ ci@@ ca@@ das , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much in the game .
&quot; la@@ ven@@ der oil is not only temp@@ ting for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also very popular for perf@@ umes and cosmetics . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plant o@@ ars with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened . &quot;
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that are considered include better water distribution and slow@@ ing of evap@@ oration from the ground , but also spra@@ ying the plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dr@@ y@@ ness . &quot;
the town of Gei@@ sa in the Thurin@@ gian R@@ hö@@ n is celebrating its 1@@ 200@@ th anniversary this year .

the assass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
&quot; the employees of the weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet Wedn@@ es@@ days to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the State of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials , and inc@@ ess@@ ant drugs wars . &quot;
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security . &quot;
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels safer : they should take their children into the office , who were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them at home . &quot;
&quot; security experts have written three words onto a table at the front of the room : opponents , Neut@@ ral , Al@@ lies . &quot;
&quot; they ask the re@@ porters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary , percep@@ tions and gut feelings . &quot;
&quot; there are drug smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the pay@@ roll of government or cart@@ els , a catalog of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no rest of the violence , and while the bodies are pil@@ ing up throughout the country , more and more journalists are involved : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena Nie@@ to has taken office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are under federal protection and until now there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries this year . &quot;
&quot; among the latter is her editor and her inspiration from Ri@@ odo@@ si@@ ce , co @-@ founder of J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot;
&quot; his absence is felt deep , although his presence is present everywhere - a great photo of Val@@ dez , pointing out his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hung on the facade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce building . two re@@ porters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez , wear t @-@ shirts , showing his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porters discuss their shared themes , the trauma , their night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although a special federal prosec@@ utor &apos;s office was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists , it has only initiated two criminal proceedings to protect journalists . &quot;
&quot; as with most thousands of mur@@ ders committed every year with drug trafficking and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely brought to justice . &quot;
&quot; at Ri@@ odo@@ ce , they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a although they are in@@ tr@@ ater@@ ally and although the terrain is now even more tre@@ ach@@ erous . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting for the discussion of safety has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the why , we di@@ str@@ ust everyone . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ o@@ dol@@ ce in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an &apos;s capital . &quot;
&quot; he only managed to drive a few blocks until his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ ve River . &quot; &quot;
the Sag@@ itt@@ arius drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a wife and two grown @-@ up children .
ru@@ mo@@ urs tend to fly around freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; but , on the subject of Val@@ dez , there is practically nothing but silence . &quot;
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and the extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields in the country , as rival fac@@ tions fight here to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it does not matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a each day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated , two @-@ storey m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug que@@ ens , which are larger than many homes for the living . &quot;
&quot; forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; &quot; peace &quot; &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable har@@ bours and drug trade routes in the United States . &quot;
&quot; despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ si@@ ce , broke with the blame that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
&quot; first , in February the publication of an interview with Dam@@ asc@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of a rival cart@@ el frac@@ tions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons . &quot;
&quot; this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , assumed gang members bought every copy of the issue , as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the second mistake was to not force Val@@ dez , after the confis@@ cation of another newspaper , which had published the same story to leave the country for its own security . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he had so long survived that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there .
&quot; he worked as an experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 , when he combined with five colleagues to establish Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 USD Invest@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the intoxic@@ ation problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; over time , the newspaper has earned a reputation because of bold and honest reporting , and sales and advertising . &quot;
&quot; re@@ porters loved it to be able to publish hard @-@ fitting investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to handle . &quot;
&quot; eight years after the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for her coverage in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his Cour@@ age in the persecution of Mexican drug history , wherever it led . &quot;
he volunte@@ ered to be afraid .
&quot; I would like to continue living , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot;
&quot; drug trafficking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot;
you have to take over the task that you as a journalist falls - either that or you play the dum@@ my .
I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; what have you done in the face of so many dead ... why didn &apos;t you say what was going on ?
&quot; the Ri@@ fu@@ ce @-@ Team mis@@ ses Val@@ dez , the fun @-@ bird that could curse as a port worker , the friend , who was gener@@ ously with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Gu@@ ay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table . &quot;
&quot; now they ask , &quot; &quot; Is his love for routine destruction ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; his death , too , forced them to question their own assumptions about how to best do their job and stay alive . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret wings and run@@ ways in order to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation . &quot;
trust his own instinc@@ ts .
&quot; if it smells er@@ ron@@ eous , stay away from it . &quot;
&quot; the anger is , the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; &quot; smell is a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing is happening with J@@ avier . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home . &quot;
the landscape is changing constantly .
&quot; days before it became known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
&quot; outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree . &quot;
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ size neighborhood of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the joke , some of the re@@ porters asked if these officers were among the 50 per cent of the police officers who were not trust@@ worthy of the governor . &quot;
&quot; it is months since the re@@ porters have gone to the mountains , where the drug gangs are de facto under control . &quot;
&quot; for the edition of this week , Ri@@ o@@ dol@@ ce has spent three main stories . &quot;
there was the assass@@ ination of the former well @-@ known Box@@ ers Juli@@ o C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an expos@@ é to the state expendi@@ tures concentrated on the hom@@ etown of the governor .
&quot; there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the prosec@@ utor , conducting a kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone knows in the city : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities . &quot;
a re@@ porter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who belonged to the reign@@ ing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) which ruled almost the entire century all the political levels .
&quot; recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ cali@@ ber cases of corruption . &quot;
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous incidents in this locality , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack . &quot;
&quot; only a few months earlier , the readers would have viewed the column of Val@@ dez as the best informed source of ab@@ duction . &quot;
&quot; in the past , we had known what happened , &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; because of his slender body . &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication are broken with our sources . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez &apos;s office became a storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers prot@@ esting against the kill@@ ings of journalists , because the employees have become something they never expected : activists in the name of the press . &quot;
re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez sn@@ apped a few signs and went to a demonstration in the next morning for a further journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor .
&quot; Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
a burnt body has been discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is his .
&quot; throughout the country , journalists have become lou@@ der by writing in organized protests &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on pav@@ ements and buildings . &quot;
&quot; on this day , director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to gather international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the murder of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities to spy on journalists and kill them because they said the truth . &quot;
since then she has asked her to be re @-@ divided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated her objectiv@@ ity .
&quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were &quot; &quot; surrounded &quot; &quot; by organised crime , government officials and a similar society . &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that re@@ porters are not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the order of politicians and security forces , who put together with organised crime under a blanket . &quot;
&quot; last year , the media group &quot; Arti@@ cul@@ o 19 &quot; has been assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of police and officials . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez . &quot;
evi@@ dently the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect .
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; her body was found along with a note that was allegedly signed by the Z@@ et@@ as @-@ Kart@@ ell : &quot; &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones lie next to their separate head .
&quot; some branches have chosen to close , like the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lav Bre@@ ach in March . &quot;
&quot; others continue , as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the murder of her director in 2004 . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with an article on the title page entitled &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot; &quot;
some journalists fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as apparently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who stay behind and continue their work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , indicates that drug trafficking is frigh@@ tened . &quot;
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and so I became re@@ porter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the pav@@ ement in front of the office and drank beer , when suddenly all their phones began to bu@@ zz . &quot;
a number of sho@@ ot@@ ings with Band@@ en@@ riv@@ als and security forces near the Maz@@ at@@ lan seaside resort had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued escal@@ ating as promised by a series of cart@@ el messages in the region .
from the cur@@ b edge they released the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ k via mobile phone .
the title page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens stay close to - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the police officers who kept guard to see if they were in readiness .
&quot; if they were afraid at all , they did not show it . &quot;
&quot; under the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for all Sin@@ alo@@ a , the employees of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed their marks . &quot;
&quot; how can you just think about it , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; if on the same day J@@ avier was murdered , the train@@ ee asked me to send her to the street . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to ev@@ ade his enemies
&quot; at first sight , it looks like a statue , albeit a frigh@@ tening one . &quot;
researchers have now found out that the first findings of the incredible r@@ hin@@ o@@ cer@@ os of a Canadian mountain worker were so well preserved that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so well received that they could even notice that his sc@@ aly skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said that she had had something of an &quot; troubled past . &quot;
&quot; the report in the journal &quot; Current Biology &quot; described it as &quot; the best preserved din@@ osau@@ r ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ r specimens in the world . &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered species of no@@ dose ri@@ din@@ als living in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; his amaz@@ ingly well @-@ preserved state has start@@ led researchers , who describe it as &quot; truly remarkable , &quot; &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic the arm@@ oured her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
&quot; Sha@@ wn Funk was found to be found near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the North of Alber@@ ta , Canada on March 21st , 2011 . &quot;
&quot; he met something that would fail from the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely . &quot;
the fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years trying to uncover the wild beast within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy earth cl@@ umping . &quot;
&quot; after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you only blin@@ king a little with your eyes , you could almost believe it was sleeping , &quot; &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum where the creature is to be seen . &quot;
&quot; it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs , the Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; researchers have found out that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous , although it is covered with an arm@@ or and resembles a changing tank , probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white clo@@ ak to hide from predat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as counter @-@ sh@@ ading , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this would have allowed him to better interfere with his surroundings and ev@@ ade his enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by major din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million years old creature from the family of the No@@ ir@@ au@@ rier made head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers now studied the wild animal and named it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum technician Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours with it carefully . &quot;
the amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and arm@@ or over his body .
&quot; they discovered the counter sh@@ ading , widespread defense in the animal kingdom , which means that the head of the creature was darker than its under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta by far exceeds the animals living today . &quot;
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by sufficient pressure by eating meat eating din@@ osau@@ rs that evolution fav@@ ored the disgu@@ ise of confrontation as a means of survival .
&quot; but most contemporary animals that use the counter sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or ar@@ ma@@ dil@@ los - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loo@@ t , which signals that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was a real fight for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong predat@@ or behavior on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ r car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es must have been the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period , &quot; Brown said . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also indicates that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
&quot; scientists continue to investigate the animal on information about his life , including his preserved intestinal content , to find out what it has eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs , when he died , got into a river and driven into the sea , where he sank on the back to the bottom of the sea . &quot;
&quot; at that time Alber@@ ta was as warm as southern fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are likely far more inland than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this no@@ dose @-@ carrier is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with preser@@ v@@ ative skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal , &quot; Brown said . &quot;
the result is that the animal today looks almost exactly the same as in the early C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period .
&quot; you do not need to use a lot of imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just look a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it &apos;s going to sleep . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period was a time when giant ther@@ opo@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ r , who stood on two legs crossed the earth . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , the Tyran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , lived millions years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons heavy monster . &quot;
&quot; scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ mi@@ fied in mud . &quot;
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the North of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the preserved ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely removed from the mu@@ zzle to the hip . &quot;
&quot; the creatures were about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips that were ra@@ ged by his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es have been swept through Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea .
but the marine litter of the din@@ osau@@ r kept his arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied rem@@ nants of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the house @-@ st@@ alli@@ ons still cover b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r .
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is so rare as a win in the lot@@ tery . &quot;
&quot; the more I see it , the more conf@@ using it becomes . &quot;
&quot; pet@@ ri@@ fied rem@@ nants of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates , which carry the skull of the animal . &quot;
&quot; his right foref@@ oot lies on his side , his five fingers are spread upward . &quot;
I can count the scales on his sole .
in the thunder@@ storm : mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ age at A@@ 8 : many injured
heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A@@ 8 : nearly 30 vehicles are involved in mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
&quot; there are numerous injured , kilometres long stands - and G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) , around 20 people were injured at a mass @-@ car@@ am@@ bol@@ age on Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; after the brief@@ ing of the police at 5 p.m. , between the junction points Adel@@ ant@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm almost 30 vehicles , among them probably also trucks , crashed into each other . &quot;
&quot; at first , no information was given on the exact number of the injured . &quot;
&quot; it was a matter of mild to moderate injuries , said a police spokes@@ man . &quot;
a large supply of rescue vehicles was at the accident site .
the A@@ 8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich .
&quot; in the direction of the Munich driving direction , a distance of approximately ten kilometres was formed . &quot;
&quot; as an A@@ Z re@@ porter reports , there was also a massive han@@ di@@ cap on the revers@@ ing train - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; the fire bri@@ g@@ ade noted the characteristics of the car drivers , which now have to be reck@@ oned with sensitive pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 there was a second accident on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a car .
a helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group testing &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it &apos;s a moment that almost everyone has experienced once : nothing at all is sitting in the train and sleeping .
or one is deep@@ ened in his work and has just an ingeni@@ ous thought .
and then : buff@@ s .
&quot; comes from the conductor and w@@ akes an aw@@ k@@ ward , or ri@@ ps the passenger in the middle of the workflow . &quot;
ticket control .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are over .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the hand@@ less ticket control .
one simply confirms by mobile phone that one takes its place and de@@ values the ticket .
&quot; currently , a test run runs on two routes . &quot;
&quot; if the offer comes , we expand it . &quot;
&quot; it will then be available in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; said a railway spokes@@ man . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; calls the train the ticket de@@ valuation without Schaff@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; to be able to use this , however , some requirements need to be met : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to book an online ticket - what most passengers do anyway .
&quot; it is also necessary to have the app by train , the DB Navigator , which is the most convenient way of ticket booking anyway . &quot;
and last but not least you need a seat reservation .
&quot; because the &quot; &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; works : one climbs into the train , calling his ticket under &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; . &quot; &quot;
a button for electronic de@@ valuation will then appear with the test customers .
the train atten@@ dant will receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y .
&quot; if the train driver arrives at the ticket inspec@@ tor in place Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already paid on @-@ the @-@ line ticket . &quot;
&quot; so you can continue to sleep , work on , keep silent . &quot;
&quot; check @-@ in has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should take advantage of passengers . &quot;
&quot; if you want to travel without ticket control by our train atten@@ dant , the DB Navigator simply checks for yourself . &quot;
&quot; this enables passengers to person@@ alize their travel time by train , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB Fern@@ verkehr &quot; Marketing Director . &quot;
&quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot;
&quot; those who travel by train often know that in addition to delays and missed features , ticket inspections are among the biggest offen@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; for often , in any case one of the contribut@@ ors does not have all the documents required to de@@ valuation online tickets . &quot;
&quot; either the credit card or the ID card or otherwise a document , which must be refer@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; the result is endless discussions between train atten@@ dant and passenger , leading to bad mood in the part or greater space and delays in controlling one &apos;s ticket and taking the time to take care of other matters . &quot;
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that also applies only to the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further concessions on the same route have not yet been activated .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was sha@@ ken up to her core . &quot;
&quot; just one day after she arrived in New York City , the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on her phone . &quot;
she stum@@ bled upon a mail from someone from high school .
&quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it is still on the street , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; confused as nobody else posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly being prayed on their tim@@ eline .
&quot; the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was killed , the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , killed by a white police officer in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , killed live . &quot;
he posted a picture of Brown &apos;s lifel@@ ess body which was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l thought . &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she put off her mobile phone to return later in the evening to twe@@ ets about people on the Can@@ field Drive .
&quot; there were photos of police and people crying , and of a man claiming to be Brow@@ ns &apos;s father who wore a shield with the inscription : &quot; &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &apos;s police just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
&quot; she watched a live feed , where a police officer stood in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog . &quot;
&quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman secured his gun and shou@@ ted , &quot; I will kill you ... animals kill all . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is not common , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l rec@@ alled to her statement . &quot;
this is not the kind of murder we got used to and which we can call typical .
at this moment I felt shi@@ vers .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
they booked a return flight and went home the next day .
&quot; after the landing at 11 pm , she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning . &quot;
&quot; what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the subject of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from the 11th . &quot;
&quot; it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resili@@ ence , which consists of the view of the people who live in the community and filled the streets to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; when Fer@@ rel@@ l came to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on with her daughter , who wore a flower @-@ dress and a matching crown , the two discussed a conversation that she had &quot; &quot; the black experience and the black state &quot; &quot; countless times before this morning . &quot;
&quot; you remember , how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot;
&quot; we now go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot;
&quot; I could not take her away , &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said later . &quot;
what has happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
it must know it and see it and be re@@ ared in it .
&quot; it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves in order to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I have the good fortune to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience blat@@ ant racism , she is no different from the next black women &apos;s child . &quot;
I feel I would give her a bad service to keep her away from it .
&quot; the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was on the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police office , which became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ charge of officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
&quot; there , Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter joined a local business owner who had lunch . &quot;
they prepared the bags and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; slowly , a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rel@@ l &apos;s figure . &quot;
&quot; my activ@@ ism totally changed after 9 August , &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association , concentrating on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
everything has come . &quot;
&quot; weeks later Fer@@ rel@@ l met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an during an evening demonstration , one of the film directors of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question came to Fer@@ rel@@ l : &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story that you can take advantage of ? &quot;
&quot; this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often by wh@@ ites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview , &quot; We had heard that people born and grown up in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on did not center their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an already collabor@@ ated with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around death @-@ killing occup@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; his commitment brought Fer@@ rel@@ l closer to the project , along with six other indigenous people followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ning &apos;s shooting . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks or speaks to us . we &apos;re talking , &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me , as these people are represented , for so I shall be represented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ ells &apos;s experience - to show that it is not a Messiah guide , but a community that comes together , &quot; &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most obvious participant in the film . &quot;
&quot; as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ ells live as she falls in love and married her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said and laugh@@ ed as she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I understand that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the de@@ human@@ ization of black people .
&quot; in addition , Ferr@@ ells &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , which after killing the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 , marked the film &quot; Black@@ live Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether , &quot; said Fer@@ rel , &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women have to carry the main burden of everything . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; the movement was held upright by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; when Fer@@ rel@@ l was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is no accident , even though it was at the forefront , because in a life at these jun@@ ctions as a black gay woman is so much on the game . &quot;

from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV readers to discuss bit gallery
&quot; the bit gallery moves people , even though it has not been built for a long time . &quot;
but the idea of a shopping mall at the south end of the pedestrian zone spl@@ its the population into pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
there is hardly any cold on the subject .
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; while the one to the bit gallery says , &quot; This would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; This would be really great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; don &apos;t need a person &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot;
&quot; while pro@@ pon@@ ents build that a gallery is attracting more customers into the city , the other businesses also fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the property where the farmers market hall stands , in which 13 direct markets offer their products . &quot;
it will be concluded with the start of the construction work .
the gallery @-@ makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - for Bed@@ a @-@ Platz with possibility to sit outside .
Sim@@ one Room : &quot; we have been selling in the farmers market almost every week for many years .
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the farm women are always very happy again . &quot;
we have also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us .
we would like to see that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also this .
especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing res@@ ett@@ ings in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of rent .
&quot; however , the new project will probably not be very low . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; &quot; what &apos;s your favorite in Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
&quot; clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ store or supermarkets : I find that superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
there is already enough of this in our city .
you can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .
&quot; but since there is not even a regular weekly market here , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains . &quot;
&quot; after all , the goods offered there are fresh , is mostly offered directly by the producer and is cheap at the top . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , shop shops are only rented by larger companies in a shopping mall , because the rental companies are often not portable for retailers . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s a pity , there are almost no special deals and that which is left of it will probably disappear . &quot;
wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall doesn &apos;t fit for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
&quot; above all , where is the farmer &apos;s market hall to go during construction ? &quot;
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even in the long run when the bit gallery actually comes .
or does it create the ghost bit gallery before selling all the stores from Bit@@ burg ?
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that won &apos;t work .
&quot; and a shopping center , which stands empty , no one needs . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real peasant market instead of this gallery . &quot;
&quot; but for a farmer &apos;s market hall , thanks to the ins@@ an@@ ely many - as I find - meaning@@ less building projects in Bit@@ burg no longer room . &quot;
&quot; when the farmer &apos;s market hall is destroyed , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
&quot; in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are to be seen - white , black and brown , which are almost in@@ conspic@@ uous - hanging at cables from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ pers and hair@@ cuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
&quot; Mann@@ ing sent cuts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former intelligence analy@@ st ban@@ ished a 35 @-@ year prison term after publicly disclosed diplomatic news about the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website . &quot;
&quot; the new exhibition , which was opened on August 2 , is called A Bec@@ oming St@@ resem@@ b@@ lance . &quot;
&quot; she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline united her expertise in technology , computer sciences and art , and Mann@@ ing , a Trans@@ woman and pioneering dis@@ sident , whose condem@@ nation had been converted by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; due to the algorith@@ mic analysis of the DNA extracted by Mann@@ ing and created out of the 30 portraits , how someone could look with these gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also to identity . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but already openly talked about identification as a woman , was convic@@ ted in 2013 for 20 accus@@ ations , including six violations of the es@@ pi@@ onage law , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; the jail was supp@@ ressed , so much so that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ and @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing obviously sits on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde piece - with which she was associated . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came just out of the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; . &quot;
&quot; in this , the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts like cigarette but@@ ts and ch@@ ewing gum , extrac@@ ting the DNA from the tr@@ ash to produce an image of how these people could look . &quot;
that was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted a sort of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press review of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she couldn &apos;t be visited at that time and she couldn &apos;t be photographed , so you took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
&quot; the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated m@@ use became un@@ equal spectac@@ les , which in the course of two years exchanged several letters . &quot;
&quot; they even created a comic book illustrated by Sho@@ ili can@@ ung@@ o , which fores@@ aw a future in which the President of Chelsea would convert judgment and she would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as was a welcome kind of happy meeting . &quot;
&quot; there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Tru@@ mp conduc@@ ts a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the governmental camp and against trans@@ gender troops in order to find new twe@@ et@@ able ways to further infl@@ ame the rigid divisions that he should actually fix . &quot;
&quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked for the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing asked with her excessive signature underneath ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name is endowed with a heart ) an end to &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , based on gender , race , sexu@@ ality , and culture . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall , her mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence is written - a jack of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show by the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des according to the highly developed scientific en@@ cyclo@@ pedia of the artist ) , how surprisingly similar , at least in biological sense , we are all . &quot;
&quot; what people will hopefully take with them is that our gen@@ ome will not take care of who we are and how openly genetic data is for an interpretation and how subj@@ ectively they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories is also to be seen . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , therefore the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is a page from the above mentioned comic @-@ novel . &quot;
&quot; it shows Mann@@ ing , how it emerges with a free spre@@ ader hand in hand from the disciplinary powers of the United States like King Kong . &quot;
&quot; if they turn your speech , then they have won , &quot; &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; said the artist , who gre@@ ets Philadelphia . &quot;
I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I talk about it .
&quot; Mann@@ ing hasn &apos;t seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it , she will be greeted by the masks in the middle of the room , from her own gen@@ om@@ ic simulator , which gather like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this was also pur@@ pos@@ eful , like everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , where their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past , I had her on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg said about the portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed Chelsea , like the movement that was also behind its liberation . &quot;
University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of Oxford University sought for killing
a nationwide crowd hunting is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee of Oxford University who are looking for susp@@ ects after a man was stab@@ bed in a luxury apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries .
&quot; on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them@@ i ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) were issued arrest warran@@ ts due to their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , such as the acts of the Cook County Court . &quot;
&quot; the documents say Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches . &quot;
a joint warning system published by the police authority of Chicago states that the corp@@ se was discovered on 27 July .
&quot; officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared dead in the scene of events , and det@@ ectiv@@ es investigate the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police are actively looking for the susp@@ ects , officials said . &quot;
&quot; since 2007 , she has been an associate professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ ase , the vice @-@ president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ them@@ ing was now in absence and excluded from entering the Nor@@ th@@ western University campus . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal case investigated by the competent authorities , and the Nor@@ th@@ western University co @-@ operates in this investigation , &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ ase . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
a spokes@@ man at the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in Britain and are ready to help the US investig@@ ators in any conceivable way . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want he to be present .
&quot; chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Office , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he strongly urge the susp@@ ects to face the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them strengthen themselves , &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza building , who had just received a pu@@ zz@@ ling tip , who said that something had happened in apartment 10@@ 08 . &quot;
the police described the scene as very cruel .
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear , whether the incident took place on 27 July . &quot;
it was confirmed by security cameras that lap and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the management team at Grand Plaza published an explanation to the inhabitants : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and explores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will complete the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mut@@ ko &quot;
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it will not take long to implement the remaining criteria of World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) for the restoration of the Russian Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the schedule , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ) . &quot;
&quot; the WA@@ DA road@@ map has been updated in this respect , &quot; says Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA road@@ map to comply with the Code , which describes the criteria for re@@ installing R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and was recently published on the website of the Organization . &quot;
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia . &quot;
&quot; everything has been announced , everything will be implemented . &quot;
&quot; the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; however , one of the criteria listed in the list stipul@@ ates that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren to alleged state @-@ funded dop@@ ing in Russian sports . &quot;
&quot; in regards to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we carry out the investigation as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has made a mistake . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there were no government programmes , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ kos &apos;s words coinci@@ ded with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with the Russian sales office at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ nov admitted problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; no one proposed to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was ruled out in November 2015 as part of the dop@@ ing sc@@ andal of WA@@ DA by the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia .
&quot; however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ( U@@ K@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; following a visit to the main district of the Moscow organization in July , WA@@ DA CEO Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA &quot; &quot; moved in the right direction &quot; &quot; to be used again . &quot;

the start @-@ ups that will help your business not to become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure luck with your employees at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up but the surveys did not work .
&quot; answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers were not gri@@ eving the process . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and objectiv@@ ity , &quot; &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care Company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot;
she has called people from the outside for help .
a new Human Resources start @-@ ups race is at the pace to help companies find out how their employees feel .
&quot; by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it enables companies to conduct surveys , provide staff anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases allow whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers to circum@@ vent C @-@ Suite managers and turn directly to the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; you now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking your health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement . &quot;
he said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t .
&quot; in addition to Sn@@ ap Sur@@ veys and surveys from specific teams , it offers a heat map of the company that shows which units have most complaints and which managers have low grant results - allowing you to re @-@ drill , why . &quot;
&quot; companies come to see that they have to stay at the top of the workplace culture so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber , who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post describing an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment where those who have spoken were punished . &quot;
&quot; for start @-@ ups , such as G@@ lin@@ t , this desire for an overview is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity . &quot;
&quot; global governance , regulation and compliance is expected to have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion in 2020 , according to the Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments website . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , the company helps prevent and recognize bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity early this year in the middle of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ all in Mis@@ z@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ ver@@ cent has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
U@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
&quot; like G@@ lin@@ t , Con@@ ver@@ cent lets companies send bes@@ po@@ ke &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas . &quot;
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line that employees can report bad behavior .
&quot; and if the main business leader is involved , complaints will go directly to the supervisory board . &quot;
&quot; the Court of Public Opinion has captured the regulator , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and CEO of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; if a company is found that treats its employees badly or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences by consumers boy@@ cot@@ t , employee fluctu@@ ation and complaints , Qu@@ in@@ lan said . &quot;
&quot; ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , Con@@ ver@@ cent has deployed for over a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to achieve their corporate headquarters . &quot;
&quot; in the past , when an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often a timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ Y@@ S General Co@@ uns@@ el who said there was no good way to track the complaints of staff . &quot;
&quot; now that the company uses Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that have previously been hidden by managers sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair intern@@ s - can be identified and addressed faster . &quot;
&quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view of the experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who leads the Risk Management Group from Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes . &quot;
&quot; companies started to take ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 , after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed because of ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said . &quot;
but it took until the &quot; social media came to their right &quot; that businesses realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online .
&quot; prior to using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer their software as a service and charge the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start @-@ ups .
&quot; cent received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; in November of B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners , gl@@ itz@@ ers secured a total of $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; these investments are hardly surprising considering the inter@@ connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before .
&quot; in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only bets . &quot;
employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company that is their voices , and that the work you do , they feel stronger to make this company successful , &quot; &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
investors reach returns when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and committed .
&quot; when the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support . &quot;
the data about employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the car@@ et@@ akers of a company do not take action .
&quot; in fact , when a company asks staff for your feedback , there may be a expectation that change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the change does not come fast enough , or not at all , it can discipline dis@@ appointments and motiv@@ ate employees . &quot;
&quot; if you are asking for 4,000 suggestions , you need to be ready to have 4,000 talks , &quot; &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at Business Management firm Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have too much to rely on collecting data . &quot;
&quot; because if you don &apos;t follow , employees will ask yourself , &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot;
do you care about this ?
&quot; and if you don &apos;t care about it , why should I ? &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now conduc@@ ts monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate measures on the same day if a problem is reported via G@@ lin@@ t , so saves . &quot;
&quot; and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , she was able to re@@ organize multiple teams within the company and to add a communication training to address problems . &quot;
&quot; at Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company keeps getting new insights into employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better bond of workers in a sector that is known for high turnover . &quot;
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you lose customers too . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , then you will lose business . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the fry
it is about 11@@ pm when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA football players enter@@ tain on one side of the team &apos;s new practice fields on campus .
some have pulled off their tri@@ cot parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team these idle minutes represent a lunch break .
players who are enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final examinations after the three @-@ hour exercise before returning to the Water@@ man Football Center on the next morning .
&quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real treadmill , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before Monday to Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A eliminated two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of the players , and they have actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three trainings of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 7 : 15 p.m. to meet the already packed schedule of the players . &quot;
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day at which the Bru@@ ins postpon@@ ed the start of the camp almost one week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six seasons carried out practical exercises in West@@ wood .
they should stop 18 exercises during August . 20 before the formal preparations for their pr@@ elu@@ de to Texas A &amp; M in September .
&quot; Mor@@ a said that he supported the change of rules of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add another point to the multi@@ busy routes of the players . &quot;
&quot; we put this tremendous strain on them three or four days , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; Mor@@ a said . &quot;
&quot; and they simply pushed it through , they plum@@ met , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think , as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it becomes really great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practice once the camp is completed , which in view of the clear visibility of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of up@@ scale class that has already been abandoned with foot@@ balls , which will be a protective enclosure behind a door@@ post , which will not be an easy task . &quot;
&quot; bru@@ ins should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far @-@ fet@@ ched to think that people can rent a room there and then set it up to record an exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you have the video tape from an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal . &quot;
&quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 . &quot;
we will do the best with what we have .
that &apos;s why I don &apos;t worry too much about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy fact review in the fight against fake news
&quot; Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false feedback to third party fak@@ ers and show their results below the original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it &apos;s one of its efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news . &quot;
the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect possible false reports and to send them to factor verification that may display results of the factor testing out of the original article .
&quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the 2016 presidential election . &quot;
&quot; the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters being flooded with false stories ahead of the presidential elections in May , and Germany is supporting a plan to eradic@@ ate hat@@ eful posts as before the elections there in September . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate explanation of German that a test of the new facts review will be started in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany . &quot;
&quot; in addition to finding out what stories are challenged by fac@@ tor@@ ments of third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , product manager for Facebook news in a blog . &quot;
&quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the &quot; &quot; related article &quot; &quot; and work on other changes to its news feed to reduce false messages . &quot;
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
&quot; in his younger past , the small Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 &apos;s and 1980 &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has lived in K@@ ent 700 years of turbul@@ ent history and has now become inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ ed Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says melanch@@ oly . &quot;
what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England &quot; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Ste@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Is@@ abel Gre@@ enberg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rho@@ des , based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpected emotional . &quot;
&quot; I just responded to the thumb print on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is his thumb print !
&quot; and letters always smell like smoke , because at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it were also there . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
&quot; for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest , I have over@@ rated my welcome gru@@ dge &quot; ) this seems to be too beautiful to be true . &quot;
&quot; Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , exploring the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted Hy@@ drop@@ e pots on the walls and bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he wander@@ ed through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle and talked to landscape patches , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he drank a whis@@ key and started writing . &quot;
&quot; the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown since the National Trust won the full access until 2006 , when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died . &quot;
&quot; when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just started to take care of the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years , in which ari@@ sto@@ cr@@ ats said , &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of English Emp@@ ires , cards representing what possessed : &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; Rho@@ des says , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to have fought two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let &apos;s go all his way ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive on a broader base into English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of an u@@ pro@@ ar appearing in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ gh@@ tly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; &quot; Rho@@ des says . &quot;
the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought that an uprising was a good start .
perhaps the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot;
&quot; other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ ter , which the Dar@@ rel@@ l family hid for seven years during the English Reformation . &quot;
&quot; or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; , in which the smu@@ gg@@ ler Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l was portra@@ yed in the 18th century , who staged his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentlemen seemed to be quite a cro@@ ok , always pay debts and spend money for things they couldn &apos;t afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l @-@ men dissolved their debt crises by mar@@ rying wealthy old women - I imagine it as a bunch of good looking guys , with a talent to adverti@@ se land@@ slide . &quot;
&quot; after the end of his involvement in the castle , Rho@@ des is looking for other unique write experiences &quot;
&quot; he has taken a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ män@@ mä@@ ki , the grounds of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like , &quot; Ah , now I have to cope with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle covered in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
&quot; with the un@@ v@@ eiling of the 30@@ 1 year old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Honnef has launched its campaign on Friday to launch a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) . &quot;
&quot; until Thursday , mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team want to keep the logo and the slogan secret by Nelson Ar@@ tz . &quot;
&quot; at the end of August , it will be the highlight of the campaign to give a celebration on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th . &quot;
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; or ? , &quot; the film@@ makers ask the action yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer chapel . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t really think that ( of course ! ) , &quot; &quot; they write on their website that was released yesterday . &quot;
but we use this measure to attract your attention .
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; basically , we are firmly convinced that as bad Honne@@ fer citizens we are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
&quot; the action is more than &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it means further . &quot;
&quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all @-@ inclusive promise , one that gives the city an unmistak@@ able unique selling proposition . &quot;
&quot; finally , they compete with other municipalities . &quot;
&quot; in Bad Honnef , the city of Bad Honnef will cost itself its new umbrella brand and the campaign . &quot;
military reform in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
&quot; each year at the beginning of August , Ankara &apos;s Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advises on pen@@ sion@@ ers and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps . &quot;
so also this week .
at first sight a normal process .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt .
&quot; the meeting was no longer held in the headquarters of the general staff , as before , but at the office of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; under the chair@@ manship of the Prime Minister , the five deputy prime ministers as well as the Ministers of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs took part in the discussions . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the civilians in the Y@@ AS were in number . &quot;
the government is pulling the re@@ ins in the military .
&quot; the Chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , the air forces and the nav@@ y have been dismissed . &quot;
&quot; since the failed coup , head of head Erdoğan fired 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als . &quot;
&quot; more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged links to the movement of the exile @-@ pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who sees Erdo@@ gan as the wi@@ ret@@ tor of the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; against 4@@ 86 people , who have been directly involved in the attempted coup , will be dealt with in Ankara following this week . &quot;
&quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdoğan had called the coup attempt as a &quot; &quot; God &apos;s gift &quot; &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to completely clean the armed forces . &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really have a grip on the army ?
&quot; at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ comfortable in the Military Head@@ quarters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the general staff , there are concerns about increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ fests itself in the lifting of the head@@ scar@@ ring ban on female soldiers , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; at any rate , the large @-@ scale model in the army and the security forces continues . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ July , by decree , Erdo@@ gan made further 7@@ 3@@ 95 government servants , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers . &quot;
it seemed that Erdo@@ gan has t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als used to pass earlier than the actual masters of the country .
three times they put@@ ted their role as guar@@ dian of the secular state order .
&quot; following his election victory in 2002 , Erdoğan pressed the power of the military in step by step , not least by calling on the European Union &apos;s reforms . &quot;
former officers say that Erdo@@ gan is specifically driving an Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; a name @-@ by @-@ name officer , who was seeking asylum after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat against persecution abroad , would be the Turkish army in a few years &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and sal@@ a@@ fi@@ sts . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if that is true , such a development could not leave NATO cold . &quot;
&quot; in any case , there is a doubt about the readiness of the Turkish army in the alliance after the pur@@ ge . &quot;
&quot; leadership structures and operational capabilities are &quot; weakened , &quot; say NATO diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
&quot; there will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the Green Card rules , President Donald Tru@@ mp quoted from the media . &quot;
&quot; he plans to lower the legal immigrants to 50,000 a year , stric@@ ter rules on obtaining vis@@ as for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family @-@ oriented vis@@ as . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pa@@ yers and will do this by changing the way US citizens are spent in other countries &apos; green cards . &quot;
the law will prevent the migration of chains and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English , who have the financial means to support themselves and demonstrate knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; said Tru@@ mp , quoted by the American media . &quot;
Ministry wants to renov@@ ate the circuit for the airport shuttle
&quot; over the past few months , over the past few months over the future of the platform utt@@ les had been cont@@ ested - now it &apos;s supposed to be very fast . &quot;
&quot; before the end of the year , the tourist train will be built on the &quot; &quot; mar@@ bled &quot; &quot; route . &quot;
&quot; in order to secure the future of the stake in the long term , construction work will start on the route according to the Ministry of Transport . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to further order and renov@@ ate the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country is particularly committed to tourism , &quot; declared Traffic Secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot;
the costs for the repair of the circuit were estimated at around 2.5 million euros .
&quot; from this sum , the country takes 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , based on which the shuttle is to be ordered in the future of the country , is currently being fin@@ alised , declared S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the Ministry and the Southern Thurin@@ gian railway as operator are already agreed on the technical details .
&quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards have been negotiated , &quot; S@@ üh@@ l said . &quot;
the planned contract between the Ministry and the Railway Society will be closed for a period of eleven years .
&quot; as a result , the Renn@@ stei@@ g shuttle should be ordered regularly on December 2017 . &quot;
the Renn@@ stei@@ g Shuttle is a popular rail link between the Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g railway stations .
&quot; in the course of a pilot operation , over the past few months , it has been tested as to whether the route is used by sufficient number of people to order them regularly in the future . &quot;
the track is also very b@@ ump@@ y in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried
&quot; just as you thought it could not become even more crazy in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming . &quot;
&quot; yes , indeed . &quot;
sex robots are at the moment a big deal .
&quot; recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots within the next five to ten years . &quot;
&quot; according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Professor of Robot@@ ics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must start taking their ascension seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye colour of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail . &quot;
&quot; people make fun of them , but the businesses deliver a lot of it , and we will see them much more often , &quot; &quot; said Mr Sh@@ ark@@ ey in the publication of his new report . &quot;
modern sex dolls have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can also &quot; &quot; adapt &quot; &quot; his robot according to his beliefs and choose everything from the eye colour of the robot over the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or colour of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; but it becomes even more uns@@ ett@@ ling , as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that a st@@ on@@ ford @-@ woman would look progressive . &quot;
modern sex dolls have evolved to robots with a silicone skin .
&quot; the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the characteristics they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy gold sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed characters like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which gives the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild Wend@@ y &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; &quot; he@@ ats the True Compan@@ ion website . &quot;
&quot; so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
in the course of the day she also has her m@@ oods - just like real people !
&quot; she can be tired , be fixed on conversation or she can be &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; there are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace genuine human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive female features , the all@@ u@@ sions to rape if you take a step towards Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means : reluct@@ ant ) Far@@ rah , alarm one the most . &quot;
&quot; true Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator on its website , but for men . &quot;
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then not have Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just just another sex toy . &quot;
&quot; their formation and increasing sophisti@@ cation point to slightly darker and deeper into our culture , towards a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with sub@@ ju@@ g@@ ation as an optional addition . &quot;
&quot; most men will of course not hold any sex robots , and while the FR@@ R records their increasing popularity , they remain on the ver@@ ge of consumer culture . &quot;
but what le@@ aks out of the boundary zones can be very instruc@@ tive with regard to the spirit of time in which we live .
and many people are not odd or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission to do so .
&quot; there is , however , a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots are emerging in a time where women &apos;s rights are threatened globally in which there is a president in the White House who has bo@@ asted to have women sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; the most deter@@ rent aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The maid &apos;s report &apos; ) are not the graphic images , the dev@@ oured body and the exposed eyes , but how realistic this vision works . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment this does not feel like a big jump . &quot;
the goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical resem@@ b@@ lance to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( albeit with por@@ no@@ star pro@@ por@@ tions ) .
your builders want them to feel human to im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; but , when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot;
they cannot separate themselves from their companions or simply go away .
&quot; they have no mediation or background history , nothing that hin@@ ders independence or anything that could distur@@ b the fantasy of total submission . &quot;
&quot; in other words , they are pleasing slaves . &quot;
or to express it in the 2017 Rede@@ mption : ma@@ ids
is Tru@@ mp@@ s great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy human mind
it has become a tru@@ ism of the Tru@@ mp @-@ era that the political divisions that pol@@ arized the US elec@@ torate have also divided families in small @-@ format .
&quot; around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving , there were newspapers in the USA with advice about how to deal with the horror of Tru@@ mp &apos;s sel@@ ectable relatives . &quot;
we all tried to ex@@ ert all of us to burst our filter bubbles .
less noticed is the power of tru@@ mp to bring families together .
&quot; I mention this because my cous@@ in , a left @-@ handed poet who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York . &quot;
it reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
&quot; with Tru@@ mp in the White House , anyone whom she knows , including the republi@@ can kin@@ ship with which she had fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and very strange on the same side . &quot;
&quot; for the dining table this is certainly a good thing , but it is in a further context that this also brings significant risks . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tru@@ mp , but the resul@@ t@@ ant effect of his pres@@ idency has the power to push all of us to the right . &quot;
&quot; when we speak of &quot; &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; &quot; and Tru@@ mp , we refer to the gru@@ es@@ ome possibility that one day his k@@ itt@@ ens won &apos;t rep@@ el us any more . &quot;
&quot; there is , however , an even more frigh@@ tening long @-@ term scenario in which Tru@@ mp Repub@@ lic@@ ans norm@@ alize the right wing , who suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison to his standards . &quot;
&quot; today I find myself falling away from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ur@@ com@@ ical version of the mad@@ man - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked ) - both compared to Tru@@ mp in fact seem to be one of very mild off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; when Tru@@ mp dies , the next candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans must be mentally healthy to qualify as an im@@ meas@@ urable improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my cous@@ in was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the biggest car@@ ous@@ el of the New York Parks , and the best three dollars to spend in the city if you don &apos;t need any caffeine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormously big , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are grow@@ ling and the animals turn to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate @-@ transmitting music con@@ veys this in a strange way . &quot;
&quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of tall buildings become old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city is not just the dream . &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not quite across the day when I found out that Swiss Cot@@ tage is not a Swiss Cot@@ tage - the Them@@ e Pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage is not counted - but a big roundabout in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; the Central Park car@@ ous@@ el is still a stran@@ gely magical experience , because here two two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s can go on it and all have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could have evaluated the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but luckily no one asked . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter . &quot;
&quot; this not only leads to a slow@@ ing down of what actually should be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ ologi@@ zing , while I was tired of having the experience to hand my credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain transferred from prison to hospital
Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital stay for the second time .
&quot; last year , he was taken to the hospital because of the treatment of cuts in his hands , according to the prison authorities , according to a case in his prison cell . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us was convic@@ ted of murder following an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors against the first death sentence .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning hours of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day 2013 by firing them several times through a door of the toilet booth in his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a .
&quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girlfriend for a noc@@ turn@@ al intru@@ der , hiding in the cabin . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to en@@ roll against the six @-@ year sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say that they are too len@@ i@@ ent . &quot;
the National Law En@@ forcement Administration said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the objection could be heard this year .
&quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us risks that his sentence is increased to 15 years , if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful . &quot;
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
&quot; as the last of the schools in Blum@@ berg , the four @-@ door ch@@ op@@ pers from F@@ arch@@ s and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were released in the summer holidays and in the secondary schools . &quot;
&quot; three of the students will go to the secondary school in the future , four at the secondary school . &quot;
on Tuesday evening school leader An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
&quot; as a symbol of school dis@@ mis@@ sal , the 29 students of the four classes headed by Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der voted for a young eag@@ les growing up in the chi@@ ckens , but then released into freedom . &quot;
&quot; to this end , the lively Sch@@ ar performed a musical with the title &quot; &quot; The Eagle in the chi@@ ckens &quot; . &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg and let it er@@ brü@@ ten from his chi@@ ckens .
instead of a chicken breeding a small eagle came out .
&quot; but the hope to make a chicken out of him sm@@ ashed , the eagle spreading his wings on a high mountain and sw@@ inging . &quot;
&quot; after that , the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance . &quot;
&quot; the h@@ ens danced with the young go@@ ck@@ eln , which bore cylinders to the bet . &quot;
&quot; Adler stands for integration , said school leader An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte . &quot;
&quot; the kit@@ ten is different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belongs to it . &quot;
but he will never be like a chicken .
his destiny is to be free .
she wished every four @-@ quarter sler that he feels accepted in his new school .
&quot; thanks to the colleagues , former school manager Michael Müller , who always jumps into lessons and the parent representatives . &quot;
&quot; the cooking time is over , the class teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher said . &quot;
&quot; after two years of teaching , she left her students very reluct@@ ant because it was a really great time . &quot;
&quot; in the end , they were able to rely on the four @-@ door ch@@ op@@ pers . &quot;
&quot; finally , all students left a song of summer time and holiday season . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , great joy broke out among the children . &quot;
eight first vessels have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
&quot; two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned for illegal camps in Greece , divided the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted on television . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of August 1 , the police arrested a group of illegal people in Si@@ th@@ onia , including the two Bulg@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , they were released while an investigation is underway . &quot;
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported on B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were later released .
the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened control of the free camp and place serious fin@@ es on anyone who is not supposed to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose .
the controls are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court can impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what people have to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers have to take part in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
&quot; at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars . &quot;
the aim is to improve the emission characteristics of cars in the emission classes Euro 5 and in part Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ Diesel or worse are excluded from this .
Anja S@@ met@@ e@@ anin of the ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments :
is the new promotion mandatory ?
&quot; no , the software updates are voluntary . &quot;
&quot; the mandatory updates have only been valid for the vehicles that have Schumann software , &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anine . &quot;
the retro@@ fitting has ordered the Kraft@@ fahrt @-@ Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
&quot; the manufacturers have announced rapid implementation in the next few months , but not yet called an exact date . &quot;
Daimler announces to en@@ roll every person affected .
&quot; if an inspection is due anyway , it will be done within its frame . &quot;
how long should the conver@@ sions take place altogether ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ e@@ anin . &quot;
this depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; because we have seen , the automobile manufacturers do not act voluntarily at the environmental issue so far . &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the retro@@ fitting itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming can be to get an appointment .
&quot; what do drivers that do not drive cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ? &quot;
the ace advises to wait .
&quot; probably foreign manufacturers would follow , according to S@@ met@@ e@@ anin . &quot;
will there be a massive decline in prices of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE fears that .
but even in the regions where driving prohi@@ bitions are threatening .
&quot; so far , there is no loss of value for older diesel in the rural area . &quot;
the ace advises to wait for a sale .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
&quot; the first award ceremony , under President Tru@@ mp , promises to become political . &quot;
one of the pri@@ z@@ ew@@ inners does not want to come - out of protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to receive one of the cov@@ eted awards at the prestigious Kennedy Center .
&quot; this year singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ographer Carmen de Lav@@ al@@ lad ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) are among the hon@@ our@@ ers . &quot;
the awards are handed over at the beginning of December .
&quot; traditionally , US President Donald Tru@@ mp will host a reception and take part in the ceremony with his wife Mel@@ ania . &quot;

we make the city worth living
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ la@@ chs Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , retired in R@@ ente next year . &quot;
&quot; the job is already written out , but applicants are rare . &quot;
&quot; since 31 years , W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has been a master crafts@@ man . &quot;
and the work makes him more and more fun as he communic@@ ates in the press interview .
&quot; he reports of varied , but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , it amaz@@ es that no application fulfil@@ s the requirement profile so far . &quot;
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
&quot; under consideration of the regular periods of notice , it should still be enough time for a revision . &quot;
&quot; since Has@@ lach is acting as a lower building law office for the administration community , applicants must present corresponding conclusions . &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
&quot; if it would no longer be able to fill it out , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for advice . &quot;
&quot; but clos@@ eness to the town is important to the city and it itself , says W@@ acker , who reports about a good working climate and good mood among authorities and citizens . &quot;
&quot; in more than 30 years in office , some major projects have accumulated to look back on the W@@ acker with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; he is confident about the construction office and its staff . &quot;
&quot; but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the res@@ hap@@ ing of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen parking lot have been initiated . &quot;
&quot; the Tw@@ enty Bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , and stadium restoration is still a topic . &quot;
&quot; the latter alone will beat approximately 1.5 million euros , &quot; if we do it right , &quot; W@@ acker estimates . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
design is available for a city master with great scope .
&quot; with Has@@ la@@ chs &apos;s own farm and gar@@ dener , many things can be re@@ acted flexibly . &quot;
&quot; you can move a lot , &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; since the old town stands as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye for what fits &quot; when new buildings are approved , the out@@ going city construction master emphasizes . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister bears a high level of responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is the builder , &quot; at the end , everything is going on over my table . &quot;
&quot; in the event of care and coordination , he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been working for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( Tief@@ bau ) for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; also that his successor remains long , W@@ acker wants : &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the job . &quot;
&quot; continuity is not only important for a good working climate , but also for the further design of the city . &quot;
&quot; if you want to bury Roland W@@ acker , after information from the town of Has@@ lach , you should have a completed course of studies as a diploma engineer or a bach@@ elor &apos;s degree speci@@ alizing in architecture and have good technical knowledge in the fields of construction planning and construction planning . &quot;
&quot; the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt Off@@ ers Hoch@@ - and Tief@@ bau , Construction Management , Gr@@ und@@ wer@@ age Affairs , Administration of Urban Property , Municipal Oper@@ ational Farm with Bau@@ hof and Stadt@@ bau@@ ner@@ ei , as well as the Lower Building Authority , including monument protection . &quot;
bicycle on lines thrown : South railway line closed
&quot; according to the police , the previously unknown perpetr@@ ators had thrown the blue bike on the lines of the railway track in the area of Le@@ oben Straße ( B@@ 116 ) . &quot;
these were severely damaged in such a way that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male perpetr@@ ators and have been searching for them since night hours .
&quot; close to the crime scene , a sco@@ oter and a bicycle driver were watched by witnesses . &quot;
&quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ bu@@ n empire , &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch to the AP@@ A . &quot;
he or the perpetr@@ ators would have brought himself into great danger and je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed the transport of trains .
&quot; in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant , as well as the delay of delays and the costs of the rail transport service , the cul@@ pr@@ its could also be transferred to the perpetr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; overall , a &quot; substantial &quot; sum was to be assumed , &quot; said the spokes@@ man . &quot;
&quot; the damages were fixed on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the South railway line could be managed without any disabilities . &quot;
&quot; almost ten cars were out on Friday morning , two of them concerned the correspondence . &quot;
&quot; freight trains did not fall , but they were late . &quot;
&quot; according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 meters of overhead lines had to be replaced . &quot;
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; red meat , dairy products and chocolate might help to relieve IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease ) &quot;
red meat and chocolate may sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
&quot; but a new study claims the opposite : a diet rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el diseases . &quot;
&quot; incur@@ able condition affecting approximately 1.3 million and 300@@ ,000 in the United States causes stomach cr@@ amps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , loss of weight , and extreme ti@@ redness . &quot;
&quot; while the affected person is usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms , researchers found at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , stated that immune cells are pat@@ rolling in the intest@@ ine to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes hiding in the food do not penetrate the body . &quot;
&quot; cells capable of trig@@ gering inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body , without damaging the tissues . &quot;
&quot; if the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
experiments have been discovered that a kind of tolerance @-@ promoting immune cell occurs in mice carrying a certain bacter@@ ium in its intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the mice in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet tolerant of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han encourages more tolerant , less inflammatory intestinal epith@@ elia if the same system is also employed in humans . &quot;
&quot; the Post@@ doctoral student , Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan , investigated a type of immune cell supporting the tolerance when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was separated but not . &quot;
&quot; it assumed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; the mice &apos;s intest@@ ines were sequ@@ enced and there were found six bacterial species present in the mice with the immune cells , but without it inf@@ ecting them in mice . &quot;
&quot; mice were taken up in a sterile environment , so that an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they received the L. Cross and the immune cells . &quot;
&quot; in order to understand how the bacteria were working on the immune system , the researchers allowed L. reu@@ ter@@ i to grow in a liquid and then sur@@ passed small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells , isolated from the mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed to the tolerant cells .
&quot; when the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism , known as in@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid . &quot;
&quot; if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in mice &apos;s food , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but if tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han was hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot;
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that people have the same tolerant cells as mice and that most of us protect L. Cross in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
&quot; it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; potentially , high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an extension of this population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
&quot; at Manchester United , N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic signed a &quot; genius , &quot; Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea began with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday , and impressed in the keeper &apos;s role as people as Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched at will . &quot;
&quot; M@@ atic , however , had been excluded from the prepar@@ atory Asia tour of the blues and only managed 45 minutes of what M@@ our@@ in@@ ho admitted that he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
we will help him sooner than later .
next to M@@ atic also Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u started in the Avi@@ va stadium when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho started his start @-@ XI for the start of the season .
&quot; the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho still wanted three more new commitments , but he insi@@ sted that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to meet three of its four priority new commitments . &quot;
&quot; three out of four , I thank the association , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four of four for me , but they have given great trouble . &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
&quot; the pilots flew off Seattle in the US state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in US state Mich@@ igan and with@@ drew in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , that are several thousand kilometers . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had previously made such advertising .
&quot; in this way , the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky . &quot;
&quot; new grav@@ ure for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem &quot;
&quot; as the wind turns : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD boss , S &amp; D prime ministers ble@@ w before elections with a certain concern to Berlin . &quot;
&quot; only a fire from the party centre , but not a head@@ wind from the Bund , was the most important desire of the ball@@ ots . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally . &quot;
&quot; since then , the employees from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus are watching events in the SPD @-@ governed provincial capitals with growing horror . &quot;
what Martin Schulz got from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in the approach with head@@ winds .
there were grav@@ ings .
and one after the other .
&quot; according to the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal @-@ CD@@ U sees a general signal against the coalition of SPD and Gre@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; this once more shows : red @-@ green can simply not be reliably ruled out , &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber , Germany &apos;s editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
the surprising fraction of a Green party has pl@@ ung@@ ed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
&quot; five months before the Parliament elections , his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ voice majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the Green German Managing Director Michael Kell@@ ner has called upon the back@@ sliding Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens Euro MP El@@ ke T@@ ests to give back their mandate .
the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the elec@@ torate &apos;s will .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ ests must immediately return her mandate , &quot; said the Federal Executive Officer and election campaign leader of the Gre@@ ens to the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; this must not be true , &quot; a SPD campaign milit@@ arily gro@@ ans when the new hi@@ de@@ mic message reaches the party centre on Friday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , the SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , is on the ver@@ ge of the green de@@ pu@@ ties of Alsace to CD@@ U without own government majority . &quot;
it is the provisional highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD state associations .
and no one knows what comes next .
the misery began with the un@@ expect@@ edly clear defeat at the Saar@@ land election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , no more , re@@ ass@@ uring the comrades at that time . &quot;
&quot; after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different . &quot;
&quot; this became , and indeed , everything was much worse . &quot;
&quot; the defeat in Kiel caused the SPD to w@@ ob@@ ble , the Dus@@ sel@@ dorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te beat the party smoothly . &quot;
the comrades in the weeks after that lab@@ ori@@ ously ra@@ ced again .
&quot; then , when they had just shot new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit from Hamburg came . &quot;
and with him came the next depression .
&quot; mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD leader , lost his Nim@@ bus in that weekend , because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burning . &quot;
and because he did so much wrong in the crisis communication afterwards what you can do wrong .
&quot; since then , Schol@@ z fights for its political survival . &quot;
so now Stephan Wei@@ l .
&quot; because of the VW @-@ Ex@@ hau@@ st and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Saxony Prime Minister has been in criticism for some time now . &quot;
some survey values came to an end .
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because , in recent weeks , Wei@@ l tried to set accents in the Bund . &quot;
&quot; the ambition of the former mayor of Hannover , to expand his power in Berlin , did not remain hidden in the surroundings of Martin Schulz . &quot;
&quot; they let him go , as they promised themselves a stabili@@ zation of the party . &quot;
now the exact opposite could occur .
&quot; in doing so , Wei@@ l fails to blame the party @-@ internal co@@ er@@ cion of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens . &quot;
and Schulz did not know .
&quot; at times , comrades endeav@@ our to keep their own ranks closed . &quot;
&quot; their anger is directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and here especially to the back@@ sliding parliam@@ ent@@ ari@@ sts of T@@ ests . &quot;
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , as Mrs. T@@ ests puts her own career eating over the interests of everyone else , &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. T@@ ests has not been elected to parliament because of her person as a direct candidate , but has been elected to parliament on the country list of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that it returns its mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , chief of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , compla@@ ins of an &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the vot@@ er wil@@ le four years ago was clear : people made Stephan Wei@@ l the prime minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as a leading candidate in the parliamentary elections , the R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U de@@ pu@@ ties fal@@ si@@ fies the election result , &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot;
he called for clari@@ fying the background .
I want to know if there has been more or there has been further commitments of the CD@@ U Lower Saxony .
subsidies for local politicians III
those who want to renov@@ ate his house in the year can soon get support from the country .
&quot; in addition , the mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of St@@ eg city development informed the development of urban development on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the information session , Sch@@ ind@@ ler once again gave a review of what happened so far . &quot;
&quot; since 1991 , there have been remedi@@ ation areas in sensitive areas . &quot;
&quot; at that time , in the refurb@@ ishment area I from 1991 to 2004 , the state Baden @-@ Württemberg passed two thirds of the funding amount . &quot;
&quot; in the refurb@@ ishment area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the existing renov@@ ations are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is finally important to promote the interior development , and not only to open up new building areas . &quot;
&quot; on April 4 , the District Council of Karlsruhe has received the information that there will be a re@@ development area III . &quot;
&quot; the sum of funds amounts to 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 euros , of which 500 000 euros come from the country , the rest from the community . &quot;
how is a remedi@@ ation area now created ?
&quot; one will , so Sch@@ ind@@ ler continue , investigate where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are . &quot;
&quot; it also plays a role , whether in the planned area of interest , to san@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , the area boundaries may then shift again . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday evening , the bridge represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel . &quot;
&quot; Keller presented the contents of the &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; Bund Project &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; , &quot; where the renov@@ ations would then be carried out . &quot;
&quot; the core of the program is the rev@@ ital@@ isation of inner cities , improving the living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would be carried out object @-@ related , i.e. per plot . &quot;
the rehabilitation area would eventually be defined as a Stat@@ ute .
the grant period for the funding has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
&quot; however until September this year , however , the survey would only be carried out , within the framework of which the participants in the rehabilitation area received a questionnaire . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , the goal of the charter is to take place as soon as possible , so that the renovation can begin next year . &quot;
&quot; then , Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann explained that each commune must carry out the aforementioned investigations . &quot;
it is about evaluating the conditions of urban development and deciding when to san@@ itation and to what extent .
for the respective property there will also be a remedi@@ ation remark in the land register .
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again , and get a picture of the situation , she promised . &quot;
he emphas@@ ised that an essential success factor for the project is the participation of the participants .
&quot; for this reason , there will be questionn@@ aires sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled up until the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; building and property sheet &quot; , &quot; where it deals among other things about the structural condition and the remedi@@ ation views . &quot;
&quot; in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; H@@ ous@@ ehold and H@@ ousing &quot; , &quot; information about size , division and residents of a residential area can be made . &quot;
the blue &quot; operating arc &quot; can only be filled if premises are operated in the building .
&quot; however , to be aware , Got@@ zel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , new construction measures are not condu@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
Sch@@ ind@@ ler still emphasized that the distribution of funds according to the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; works - who first comes first ad@@ mon@@ ishes first .
&quot; no funding can be made later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; finally , photos of the project &quot; Location II &quot; were shown to make a &quot; tasty &quot; refurb@@ ishment to those present . &quot;
British inventor himself uses a micro@@ chip to get in house and car with a hand movement
&quot; a British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement . &quot;
&quot; Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology by its company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory p@@ aes@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist at the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to medical standards . &quot;
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
&quot; Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the locks of houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , all for an additional charge of £ 300 per lock . &quot;
the married father of one has now installed both at home and at his BMW Z@@ 4 technology which begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the cost of the White House costs thousands of tax@@ pa@@ yers
&quot; the White House &apos;s decision to fly a nav@@ y helicopter to the South La@@ wn event for an event that highlights American production last month costs tax@@ pa@@ yers according to the military that has been left to the TI@@ ME magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tru@@ mp , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House , made a tour of products from all 50 states . &quot;
&quot; the Connec@@ ti@@ cut helicopter was issued alongside a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fighter car from Wis@@ con@@ sin and a for@@ klift from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; the White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for operation of the helicopter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to his superi@@ ors , the deputy Navy Commander for Aviation . &quot;
&quot; the message showed that on July 17th the helicopter arrived at the South La@@ wn for the event at 3 p.m. , and so long remained until the tur@@ f was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening . &quot;
&quot; the note adds that if the departure from the White House was delayed , a second crew would be required for the return flight due to the limitation of the service hours . &quot;
&quot; the original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event , while the safety personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the plane . &quot;
&quot; from the records provided by TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required . &quot;
the H@@ atch Act prohi@@ bits federal employees to use state property for political purposes .
records indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked if the event could viol@@ ate the determination .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; the commander wrote . &quot;
&quot; sounds like you are locked , &quot; answered the deputy commander . &quot;
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but even official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the President gave an impetus to reform the health reform that was going on in the Senate and he propag@@ ated efforts to cur@@ b government regulations . &quot;
&quot; the use of the airplane , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon from politically advantageous conditions . &quot;
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the journey .
&quot; but to claim their use only for a photo op , is unusual . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp conducted an investigation in February when the presidential plane was in front of the background of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of news compla@@ ining about the use of the presidential plane through its predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; said the deputy secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws often perform training flights in the Washington area and South La@@ wn area , in order to offset the US president in the White House with precise centimet@@ res . &quot;
&quot; when Tru@@ mp was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 performed 58 practice land@@ ings in the White House . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event counted for the training requirements of the flight crew for the month , said a civil servant . &quot;
&quot; helicop@@ ters units also flew 11 hours on this day for &quot; &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the White House said the tax@@ pa@@ yers accepted the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of Si@@ kor@@ sky said the company was not involved in putting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not have budget recordings for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the 2017 budget , the Do@@ D re@@ funds rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per hour . &quot;
records of the unit list the flight time of the plane as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Quanti@@ co in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pa@@ yers on the basis of estimates for re@@ funds is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual budget . &quot;
&quot; according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , Do@@ D re@@ funds do not include personnel costs , but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract completion . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the former press spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present things that are produced in America this week , &quot; Sp@@ ic@@ er said . &quot;
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ ti@@ cut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds if not even thousands of people depend on it . &quot;
and I think most Americans are all proud of the helicop@@ ters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; of course , it is appropriate to emphasize this . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear if Tru@@ mp inter@@ acted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire engine car . &quot;
&quot; in the White House , Tru@@ mp spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and j@@ ested with the media about his own fleet of company products . &quot;

TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of tricky task
the leader of the second Tennis League will join the table @-@ third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
the TC Blue @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss will start tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel on the championship @-@ third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
&quot; despite after five matches of still flaw@@ less balance sheet , the leader of the Second World Tennis League has gained the sense of reality . &quot;
team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has respect for the opponent .
this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation .
&quot; especially at the post@@ erior pole position , I find the team very good . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for the class and stability of the S@@ V , the imports from the far north are mainly concerned . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to stak@@ es in the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay , looking at Har@@ ri Hel@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ ag@@ us ( all Denmark ) . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will be hard for us as ever . &quot;
you also need a good portion of luck . &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the far north is convenient .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ 4 .
&quot; if the Italian bi@@ ella active Fren@@ ch@@ man is still active at the Chall@@ enger event in the Italian Bi@@ ella , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) will be playing at the tournament in the Czech Liber@@ ec in this season . &quot;
the previously un@@ defeated Chil@@ ean Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo was yesterday with the White @-@ rus@@ hing An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el on the ball .
&quot; he was supposed to be in Kiel as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , N@@ iel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgian Juli@@ en C@@ agn@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; following his two victories on the last Sunday against the club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could once again press the team . &quot;
&quot; if it is not enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was the number one of the junior world rank@@ ings in January 2016 , someone from the trainer &apos;s staff fills up the cad@@ re . &quot;
how America can harm O@@ MV
Donald Tru@@ mp wasn &apos;t really happy when he put his signature on Wednesday evening under the law to tigh@@ ten the sanctions against Russia .
&quot; in his hurry to en@@ act the law , &quot; he added a few &quot; constitutional provisions &quot; to the Congress . &quot;
&quot; the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was fo@@ aming against the US advance . &quot;
&quot; after all , the draft plans to punish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot;
&quot; since then , investors from the O@@ MV , together with other European companies , have been co @-@ financed the construction of the North Stream 2 Eastern Switzerland . &quot;
the dr@@ one is huge .
&quot; however , it is too early for an estimate of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Donald Tru@@ mp himself would have to raise the sanctions even by executive order . &quot;
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; the press &quot; &quot; viewed &quot; &quot; which the Group could resist and which could really hurt it . &quot;
Nar@@ cos season 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the cal@@ i Cart@@ el is put into the center of the chart by Net@@ fli@@ x
&quot; despite the second season of Nar@@ cos that Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar killer reveals , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is far from over . &quot;
&quot; the season three and four were already confirmed by streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest gu@@ sts of the show . &quot;
&quot; with the third season , the DE@@ A has directed its attention to the richest organization of the world drug trade : the Cal@@ i Kart@@ ell . &quot;
&quot; led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 enterprise &quot; with more state bri@@ ber@@ y and violent actions . &quot;
&quot; Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ Ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ azar ) is the leader of the Kart@@ ell , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) commands the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York . &quot;
&quot; in the newly published trailer , Pedro Pascal returns to J@@ avier Pe@@ ña , the guy who invites American and Colom@@ bian law enforcement authorities to support the war against drugs . &quot;
&quot; other new actors are M@@ ati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Silv@@ est@@ re , Kerry bis@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro . &quot;
the third season of Nar@@ cos will begin on 1st September .
roll backwards : the city has 46 kitchen aid
the town organis@@ es the K@@ ita lunch table again .
with fixed contact partners for the children and a assignment to the team .
in the municipal kinder@@ gar@@ tens the clock is turned back .
&quot; on September 1 , the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the municipal kinder@@ gar@@ tens ( Kit@@ as ) in its own home . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy head of the youth welfare department , this is a good news : &quot; we were all very happy . &quot;
cooking is still out of the house : a cat@@ erer takes this task and delivers fresh cooked cooked .
&quot; in the Kre@@ feld area , the city operates 46 kinder@@ gar@@ tens , in 44 the children get a warm meal at lun@@ ch@@ time . &quot;
&quot; last year , 28@@ 00 children sat at the tables , and the demand is growing steadily . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , not only children who are cared for 45 week@@ days are eating in the K@@ ita , &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ er@@ ania . &quot;
the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour supervision when children stay until 14 o &apos;clock .
&quot; 46 part @-@ time staff will have the kitchen service from September 1st : they warm up the delivered foods , supplement them with salad , raw vegetables and fruit , por@@ tioning the meal individually , give food off , clean up , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ ania . &quot;
the size - there are two groups as well as seven units - decides on the ho@@ ur@@ ly circum@@ ference .
&quot; the kitchen workers are now firmly part of the K@@ ita team , &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ ania . &quot;
&quot; in this way , they are much more involved and it is easier for the genital organs to implement pedago@@ gical concepts . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , it is also about healthy eating and cooking lessons . &quot;
the children should help prepare the food .
the direct connection of the kitchen to the team is reasonable .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a known power in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for children .
cleaning of the K@@ ita premis@@ e - until now also the task of the kitchen personnel - is done by specialist cleaning personnel in the future .
&quot; this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides the quality improvement of the kitchen performance , has also the charm that it has issued in terms of cost comparison between self @-@ control and foreign currency for the city as the most economical one , it is said from the press office . &quot;
&quot; and this , even though 46 part @-@ time forces are re@@ configured . &quot;
&quot; but these hours are not so much in weight for around 750 people in the attraction area , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; Afghan democracy depends on women &apos;s political role , says the UN &quot;
&quot; elections can only be representative if all members of the society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot;
three women candidates for the role of the vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot;
elections can only be really representative and credi@@ ble if women fully participate and be involved in all parts of the election process .
Afghan elections for the provincial council and presidential elections take place on 5 April .
the Taliban has published threats to the election process that coinci@@ de with the transition from international combat operations to an advisory role .
&quot; this year , the elections for the first time will hand over the power peac@@ efully from a democr@@ atically elected government to the next . &quot;
&quot; Hay@@ om said , a strong role for women will reinforce the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot;
the Afghan @-@ independent electoral commission reports that 1.2 million women from a total of registered 3.6 million voters are registered .

men try to ro@@ b 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl
two young men aged 19 and 23 should have tried on Thursday to ro@@ b a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl .
&quot; according to the police , the men talked to the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who stayed with friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße at 2.@@ 55 p.m. , because they wanted to phone the girl &apos;s mobile phone . &quot;
the 13 @-@ year @-@ old refused the request and continued with her friends .
&quot; as a result , one of the perpetr@@ ators tried to attack the mobile phone and the necklace of the girl , but this failed . &quot;
the duo fled without prey .
the two young men were subsequently arrested by the police .
the investigations run .
G@@ MB concerns about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a union would like to make sure that Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s managers have long @-@ term commitment to production at their factory in Glasgow .
G@@ MB Scotland said the company had weigh@@ ed about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross location .
&quot; more than 500 employees work in the plant , which produces plan@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea bis@@ cuits in addition to other products . &quot;
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
he added that employees and union representatives would &quot; first experience &quot; if their activities would change .
&quot; in a letter to the company &apos;s branch manager , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie requested that the financing for the modernis@@ ation of production lines would not be pushed forward . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , G@@ MB senior organizer , said : &quot; &quot; the fact that we can gain no clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , our members are deeply concerned about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross . &quot;
&quot; generations of families have worked here and the workers concentrated heavily on the local community and the Glasgow large area , an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of employment , wages and prosperity , and against the backdrop of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and of the chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glasgow is in urgent need of a flour@@ ishing production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; one spokes@@ woman of Pla@@ dis said : &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will respond directly to it because we value the continuous commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the employees that , like all companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate , we regularly review our business - and this applies to all our business units and locations - to remain competitive . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; over the past few years we invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognize the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site fully and completely . if our operational processes change at the site , employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona be warned three years ago in front of N@@ ey@@ mar ?
the page of La League may regret their interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; in their pursuit of N@@ ey@@ mar , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not leave N@@ ey@@ mar after releasing an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to release its release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago before the world record ? &quot;
&quot; the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer , as the league 1 club is ready to break the world record more than twice the previous mark , with Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the past season for 89 million pounds . &quot;
&quot; after completion , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest @-@ paid professional ath@@ lete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of over 500@@ ,000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out , although a source near the Catal@@ ans level is that the club has always given its best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 . &quot;
but was the soccer world warned three years ago by the PS@@ G president before this prospect ?
&quot; when Manchester City expressed interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for any club wanting to sign one of PS@@ G &apos;s best players . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , then we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but if they try to sign one of our players with them , this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish club expressed interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer . &quot;
PS@@ G made it clear that it would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its prices for N@@ ey@@ mar .

&quot; on Thursday evening , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ L@@ occ@@ um was travelling with his VW at the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au in direction of Le@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the b@@ ypass road from Stol@@ zen@@ au , a passenger car arrived in his lane , so that he had to turn right . &quot;
the Tour@@ an driver tou@@ red the lead plan@@ ks .
the car was damaged by property damage .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; report reli@@ eves the Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger
the Regensburg Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the mis@@ use cases reli@@ eves pop@@ e brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the mis@@ use sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen continues for discussions .
&quot; Christian Wei@@ sn@@ ner , spokes@@ man for the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; announced after publication in front of the German press agency , he was expecting an ap@@ ology from former Regensburg bishop and today Cardinal Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI . &quot;
it would greatly serve the prestige of the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their then false assessment of the events .
&quot; the Vatican newspaper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; on the other hand , on the other hand , critic@@ ised that in reporting on violence in the cathedral @-@ cats , &quot; two measures &quot; were measured . &quot;
&quot; in regard to the en@@ cro@@ ach@@ ments in Regensburg no one doubts that it is a matter of &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts , &quot; which would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ af@@ ia , historian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics committee . &quot;
&quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as the source of all ev@@ ils is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep it for normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ af@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria von Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis also said in the interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; &quot; we are happy to go to the church and that is a frozen food . &quot;
&quot; she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; blows a quite normal educational tool &quot; &quot; had been &quot; &quot; to be done with che@@ ek@@ y children , as I was one . &quot;
&quot; it is unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for earlier decades , as the world has changed . &quot;
&quot; in connection with reports of the mis@@ use cases , pop@@ e brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared . &quot;
&quot; completely wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who auth@@ ored the mem@@ or@@ abili@@ a &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; with R@@ atz@@ inger ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I have to take protection from Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot;
what exactly is written in the 440 @-@ page report submitted by the dioc@@ ese Regensburg with the clari@@ fication of attorney Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; in total , 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the early 1990s &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; victims of ass@@ aults . &quot;
&quot; in the final report it is named Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; to sum up , it can be said that by R. in many cases , forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied . &quot;
&quot; especially in the case of high emotion@@ ality , punishment could also be more severe for the students . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in contrast to numerous other defend@@ ants , many victims under@@ estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , can even combine positive memories with him despite violence . &quot;
&quot; in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was reli@@ eved of his opinion . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; incidents of violence on protective grounds at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , &quot; gives a contradictory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; for one , many students emphasize his &quot; humanity . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he also appears as a chol@@ eric and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , who became tangible when a Dom@@ sp@@ atz produced no top performance musi@@ cally . &quot;
how do you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ographer ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ eman : if you take the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back , one has to ask oneself rather , which is why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger appears in it at all . &quot;
he is dedicated to eight pages and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspicion of complic@@ ity or co @-@ knowing in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the exc@@ esses of violence at the prepar@@ atory school also took place outside of its sphere of influence .
&quot; at best , one can repro@@ ach him of having experienced it too late or not having taken the first references seriously enough . &quot;
&quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um , on which he worked , was perceived as literally - &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; so also the broad majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger provides a very excellent testimony , describes him as &quot; warm @-@ hearted , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher who regularly supplied the guys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and can@@ dies and &quot; always moved by grapes from children . &quot; &quot;
&quot; only a minority compla@@ ins about its perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high emotion@@ ality , which also led to break@@ through@@ s . &quot;
&quot; that he did not only kn@@ it up with chairs and cast the keys on the ground , but also gave ear and ears to the hair or ears , he has already admitted years ago , deeply regre@@ ts and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it . &quot;
&quot; to his salvation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the initial period , the 1960s and 1970s , with parents as well as with teachers . &quot;
do you also know such breeding methods ?
&quot; of course , I think every one of us who was born before 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I also experienced this in a secular school , a state gymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; compared to what is actually going on in this report , namely the horrible sexual abuse and abuse of violence at the pre @-@ school , the dre@@ ad@@ els are ad@@ mitt@@ edly . &quot;
&quot; one wonders if it is not more likely to do with his famili@@ arity and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media just fell on him . &quot;
&quot; at the Bavarian pop@@ e , many who have never understood him are still working di@@ lig@@ ently . &quot;
but the truth is : the report is reli@@ eved by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
&quot; in the media , in connection with the report a lot was reported about the issue of abuse at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger cast any involvement or co @-@ knowing in terms of sexual abuse in the final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no . no .
not one of 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults claimed to be entrusted with the Cathedral master .
not even the parents were dedicated .
&quot; I have never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or mother about it , &quot; &quot; said a person affected , &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing for me . &quot;
&quot; the real problem in the investigation of sexual abuse , however , is that most victims are silent . &quot;
&quot; if they did not even confi@@ de in parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a choir director , who would have been a colleague of the perpetr@@ ators professionally . &quot;
what is the rate of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen students R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role with regard to the abuse of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student put it this way : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... not a case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) would have had timely insights and could have stopped the perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; I consider it ... also for really absurd to assume that reck@@ oned to him ... to have opened up more urgently or more clearly or rather than to their parents , dormit@@ ory leaders , trust teachers , etc . &quot;
that one talks to him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able .
&quot; in this way , the report concludes with a clear result : &quot; that the students and / or their environment affected him in the run @-@ up could not be confirmed as part of the study . &quot;
&quot; as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is therefore acqu@@ itted of any black@@ jack . &quot;
&quot; in this way , he cannot be accused of not having prevented him or brought him to an advertisement . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there is no reason to link up to his good name with these disgu@@ ised crimes , as it happened in some cases . &quot;
much of &quot; violent exc@@ esses &quot; in the media was to be read at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
&quot; the former master master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; om@@ itting &quot; &quot; in the report . &quot;
does he have to live with this repro@@ ach ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem that everything was mixed up and mixed into a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , right in the middle , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
but precisely this is again an abuse of the report .
&quot; there is a clean separation : between the pre @-@ school and the gymn@@ asi@@ um of the cathedral @-@ cats , between sexual abuse and violence and , let us say , other repro@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report covers incidents from the time since 1945 , thus also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not choir director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; all the terrible test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases in which boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers had been victi@@ mi@@ zed and pain@@ stak@@ ingly suffered , all took place at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have to be ruled out . &quot;
&quot; but with them , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he only got the boys to face when they were already at the gymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; on this was , like most witnesses , empha@@ sizing the subject of &quot; Vor@@ schule &quot; tab@@ oo . &quot;
you were only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; paradise &quot; conditions .
what was different at the school gymn@@ asi@@ um ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but there was no sa@@ di@@ stic violence . &quot;
&quot; this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; many victims appreciate the general humanity of R. , and therefore in many cases even have positive memories of him in spite of violence . &quot; &quot;
at most the repro@@ ach remains to have looked away .
&quot; but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre @-@ school . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 when he just started to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible , ( so the witness ) didn &apos;t want to hear anything , and then again around 1993 . &quot;
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently brid@@ le the ears in front of the states ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral gymn@@ asi@@ um that the report even reproduced . &quot;
&quot; in this , he points out that &quot; in the prepar@@ atory school , the death penalty will continue to be practi@@ sed . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent intervention . &quot;
&quot; this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , as test pen@@ alties , even in Bavaria , had long been banned . &quot;
&quot; before that , they occurred in a legal grey area , as each of us is still aware of . &quot;
&quot; it was hard to estimate for him , where the persons concerned were perhaps exagger@@ ated or dram@@ ati@@ zed , and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded . &quot;
but you can &apos;t say he has always looked away .
that &apos;s just not right .
&quot; only in 1980 , the death penalty for schools was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria . &quot;
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis claimed it was unfair to apply today &apos;s pedago@@ gical standards at that time .
how do you see that ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we historians are talking about the &quot; pit@@ fall of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; i.e. the danger of evaluating past moral standards . &quot;
the princess is right .
&quot; of course , this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was det@@ rac@@ ted at all times , and not for what happened in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , which goes far beyond that at that time . &quot;
it &apos;s all horrible and I &apos;m glad that it will finally be re@@ worked .
&quot; but at the same time I have to take protection from Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , for all this had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; in the 1970s , his means of discipl@@ ining and pun@@ ishing the ears and ears of hair and ears were widespread in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; when physical punishment was then forbidden , he was strictly adher@@ ed to it . &quot;
&quot; in the conversations with you for the book &quot; &quot; My Brother of the Pope &quot; , &quot; Georg R@@ atz@@ inger described what picture of his time at the Regen@@ s@@ burger time ? &quot;
did the subject matter test also become a language ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , i.e. Pope Benedi@@ k@@ ts XVI@@ . , tells us from his perspective , as the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen played only a secondary role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I did not deny that he had a strict regi@@ ment there . &quot;
&quot; but this must be said once : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without demanding discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world tran@@ gs from the hitherto rather nation@@ ally known Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , true cultural ambass@@ adors of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cuits and can@@ dies alone , the rebel@@ li@@ ous boys don &apos;t even make a big singer and stand before any success , regardless of the area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming . &quot;
what kind of person did you experience with Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in conversations with her book ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : through work on the book and beyond , I have met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and again and again experienced as wonderful , humor@@ ous , basic @-@ loving , deeply believing and sav@@ our@@ y people , of whom you can &apos;t imagine that he could do anything in a fly . &quot;
&quot; I get regular contact with how many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen still today , 23 years after his execution , regularly keep contact with him , visit him , read him - he &apos;s almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those who do not forgive him until today , that he once was stern to them , are therefore clearly in the minority . &quot;
most of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are grateful to him for enrich@@ ing their lives and bringing them closer to the world of music .
&quot; and that he is always a good , father@@ ly teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lov@@ able respect for her , to which she is still looking at and whom she ad@@ ores . &quot;
&quot; and please , once again , clearly : everything that is proposed to him are educational methods which were on the order of the day at that time . &quot;
we can be happy that we have long since overcome this time .
&quot; but it is extremely un@@ just , a man , just because he is promin@@ ently and has an even more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
the evil intent behind it is only too obvious .
&quot; for the report , which was just published , reli@@ eves him . &quot;
&quot; now the estate would command , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside Bavaria and perhaps even Germany , nobody would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace . &quot;
