<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four maps that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren-Anstalt for young people to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A chapel that is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Farmers cultivate the former basis of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It annoys when maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows this because the car-Navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportal Bavaria of the state government, are anything but up to date - but just therefore very informative."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when compared with current online maps.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread-area of Munich's Merkur since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a patchwork carpet that is not immediately recognized as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">"detailed maps, so-called document sheets, were incorporated into the large overview map for towns and municipalities."</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the Bavarian surveying management between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French military leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"even though the French troops finally departed with the peace of Lunéville on 9 February 1801, the present-day neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria map."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Elector Max IV Joseph drove the project forward, founded the" Topographic Bureau "- and thus the Bavarian surveying management."</seg>
<seg id="19">The manuscript for Munich dates back to 1856 and is to be found like all others on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the comparison of earlier / today is most impressive, for example, the state capital."</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">"an example of this is the subconscious, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856."</seg>
<seg id="23">"he was born 21 years after the drawing up of the map, in 1877, in the district of Munich."</seg>
<seg id="24">"today, Untersendling is in the middle of the city."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses of Untersendling are concentrated around 1856 along the present Plinganserstrasse, which was named after George Sebastian Plinganser until 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where today is the Westpark, one sees nothing as fields - at first sight: when zooming in appears a small-part card with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten numbered flurings from the so-called" "urine" "from which the basic tax was derived."</seg>
<seg id="27">Small plots show no more farmers there today - but smallgardeners of the plant "Land in sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Theresienwiese, the site of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was actually still a meadow - and no concrete desert."</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the other hand of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine."</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the field of the present district Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name" "Gasteig" "or the" "Auf der Lüfte" "- but also in large letters" "Irren Anstalt". ""</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße, one once locked people with delusions."</seg>
<seg id="33">"in 1858 / 59, the Munich District-Irrenanstalt" On der Auer Lüfte "was born there."</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the institution - the psychiatrist, who was brought to the death of King Ludwig II."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was progressive for his time and, for example, ended the anchor of the so-called Irren."</seg>
<seg id="36">"he also forbids the personnel to employ violence against the occupants," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who has worked for an exhibition with the institution. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"for 280 patients it was first place, later it was extended to 500 seats."</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the circular rendezvous in hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">"since 2006, the Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatric centres, has been located there since 2006."</seg>
<seg id="40">"at the site of the former Auer Anstalt, young people now meet in the Munich Salesianum."</seg>
<seg id="41">The order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it to a youth hostel with training facilities.</seg>
<seg id="42">"West is the football field of the TSV Munich East, east of residential buildings from the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015, the children's house" Casa Don Bosco "was built - architecturally reminiscent of the original building of the Irrenanstalt, which was destroyed during the Second World War in bombing raids."</seg>
<seg id="44">"the Marienplatz was registered in 1856 as" Main Square, "the Kaufingerstraße was named" Kaufinger Gasse. ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">"in December 1944, the Allied bombs burst into the city centre."</seg>
<seg id="47">A large remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the English institute, small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days will be the preparatory work and on April 5, 2017, the ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn commuter line."</seg>
<seg id="49">"with the slider, the old Munich-map can be compared with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof."</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights Group publishes warnings for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for Farabby has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri due to the discriminatory policies and racist attacks of the state.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which will enter into force by August 28, 2017, urges afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention when travelling through the state, as a series of questionable, race-based incidents occur throughout the country and will be noted here," says the Group's opinion. "</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes it people harder to claim discrimination, as well as prosecuting authorities of the state who are disproportionately targeting minorities, prompted the group to release the warning, said the NAACP."</seg>
<seg id="54">They have violations of civil rights that happen to people.</seg>
<seg id="55">"they are stopped because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed," said the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star. "</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group cited incidents such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no more fuel during the journey, and was put into custody by the police of Missouri without being accused of a crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also points out a recent report by the Office of the Missouri Attorney General, which shows that black drivers will be held in the state 75 percent more often than whites."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," "said Chapel."</seg>
<seg id="62">People need to be willing to bring money or to know relatives that they travel through the state.</seg>
<seg id="63">"Missouri awarded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime report, which rank the state with respect to the number of such injuries to the 16th position of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">The warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to accuse a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">"prior to that, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states passed immigration laws that commit local law enforcement authorities to arrest people because of immigration violations, which will contribute to further racial profiling."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but lately stakeholders have used the measure to respond to certain laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">Turndown project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischerbach Weidefence project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Parliamentary Committees Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac have provided an image on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">Representatives of the Fischbacher-CDU-centre-association gathered together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies at the right-grabbing family of Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann granted first insights into his company, in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 milk cows and also many young animals and accommodated in five apartments holiday palaces."</seg>
<seg id="72">"for him, the" Black Forest milk "is the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows, such as Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Feriengaeste is only Regionales.</seg>
<seg id="74">"since he is also the chair of BLHV, he called the" "electric fence project" "as" "elementary importance". ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot profit on such steep areas.</seg>
<seg id="76">"the grassland surface care for a lot of work, a lot must be processed with the brushcutter."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have here to fight with the conditions and with the topography," "stressed Mr Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003, he took over the parental operation and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertiliser, even if he did not conduct bio-operation."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" the Commune has recognised the significance of the electric fence project and is happy about the promotion of its leaders. "</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">I hope that the afforestation of the areas could be extended quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the biggest treasure we have are the people who work in agriculture and think about how to continue their business," said the mayor. "</seg>
<seg id="83">The farmers are often criticized for the promotion</seg>
<seg id="84">"in 2013, a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in over the electric fence feed."</seg>
<seg id="85">"thus, the area of disclosure is 40 hectares, which cannot be afforested until at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"half of the total cost of 71 500 euros was promoted via Leader, a quarter carried the municipality of Fischbach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus, farmers stayed 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 km of pasture-fence."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac stressed:" "you are doing a really good job without farmers and farmers."</seg>
<seg id="90">"Peter Weiss also stood firm:" "here, best groceries are produced." ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Conservation Line (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows state support of pasture-fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to maintain the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The assumption of full take-up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform.</seg>
<seg id="94">"in addition, the fencing area must not be passable (handeft above 35 per cent) and must therefore be threatened by the afforestation."</seg>
<seg id="95">"at the moment, eight participants with 24 plots, who would like to build a fence around 16 kilometres of fence, are currently running for the Fishermen Weizaunching Project 2018."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the area of disclosure corresponds to 35 hectares, and the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes up the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">"the Americans like this as well as any other - therefore, the sortually staged fall of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003."</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump Regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated quarrel with Jim Acosta of CNN about the President's proposals for the drastic limitation of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to be fair, Miller didn't handle the statue himself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and liberty imitators would have liked him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but it resorted to its importance, and in particular the significance it was attributed to when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base."</seg>
<seg id="105">"as Miller Acosta complained," I don't want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world. "</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem on which you refer to which was later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is factually correct, but as he formulated it himself, it is not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary resonance of the angry words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor:" your tired, your poor, / your afflicted masses, who yearn to breathe freely, and the miserable waste of your rich coasts. "</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time in which the "miserable garbage" on our screens was better to see.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller didn't get involved in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people were not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the meaning of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is in fact a conflict about the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">"Lazarus - and her friends, who set themselves to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they had performed a highly political act."</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture was to show the ties between French and American Republicanism by portraying the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical depiction.</seg>
<seg id="114">"Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice."</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of the exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the great writing of Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued that the Statue of Liberty is not a drawer but rather an early neo-conservative, who brings the American flame to the surrounding world:" Lady Liberty is moving forward. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It is intended to carry out the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch is not meant to enlighten the way to the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">"quite unusual, Limbaugh has come across something here."</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is completely and even a question of the point of view of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible voyages on the deck of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and have a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">"of course, this is not the perspective that Miller and Trump have ever wanted to acknowledge."</seg>
<seg id="127">"their torch should not light the way, but ignite the hatred that is their only source of power."</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish Members of the Great Britain team</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle reminisces about a time when only two Scots belonged to the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="130">"the Director of Athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent in the world championship loader will make a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes were selected for London 2017 that kicks off on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">"black believes that" "Scotland is developing something special" "and the athletics of the United Kingdom must learn from it."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it and we try to understand it, and we will continue it until we find it out," Black said. "</seg>
<seg id="134">I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances is, it's absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butwand - who are competing against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m circuit, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the team to captain."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "ilidh is rather modest."</seg>
<seg id="141">"your captain's speech was incredible," says Black. "</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or where ever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh brought together was great.</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth Silver medal winner, who will compete in their fifth world championships in the 400 m hurdles, says that it is" unbelievable "that 16 Scotsman are in the British team."</seg>
<seg id="145">"Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015."</seg>
<seg id="146">The road-runner Muir leads along this road and last year has set up five British and two European records.</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman, which one should observe after a great season which included the British Team Trials and Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle reminisces about their first world championships when the only other Scotsman was in Team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the team captain tells them that they are" enormously proud "of the fact that many of their compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases they will also be involved in the medals and finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about being a team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and chose me, makes it something very special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">Obviously I am very proud of all the Scotsman who belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as well-established athletes, athletes who want to rise to podiums."</seg>
<seg id="155">What concerns my speech as captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think she went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only pointed out that in this situation we are very happy as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it's really important to put on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there.</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking criticism from critics on Facebook: don't worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate the heating of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew somewhat of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it did not last long until the newspapers hit him because of everything, from domestic politics to his political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">"he knocked at the critique, sure."</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"in 1783, Washington said:" freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute we are led like sheep to slaughter. "</seg>
<seg id="166">"this brings me to Maryland governor Larry Hogan, who has to work on being more like Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked and deleted posts by at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union accused him of this in the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the governor's staff dismissed the suit as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a counter reaction with" Na, and?. ""</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's just Facebook," many people said. "</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when it is a guy like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is astonishingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">It has the second highest agreement of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat-head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and to debate his hair-less head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore the blocking of persons coming to the side of the governor - which is a public forum known as officially and of employees paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">But it's too easy to use the picture of trolls or spammers or hateful people who swing the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The mail talked to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"and these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, no trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful and non-professional."</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor cited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not bottled, but she asked for Hassan."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the commentary box of the news agency "The Post." "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I don't really appreciate this idea, if a number of people take a position on the same topic, then they are despised by some rather than a so-called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the Governors referred to as" "concentrated spam attacks", "others would probably call" intercession. ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is much cleaner than in earlier times, if you have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles, or to arrest and silence protesters."</seg>
<seg id="191">But this is exactly what happens digital.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official who criticises Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is accused of Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County violated the First Amendment, according to US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banished a voter from her Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">"and in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="197">It should not be that difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at the time of Washington, the time of an affordable port had a similar effect on the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers was multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous writing writers crashed into his leadership."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">"people who used pseudonyms like" Juricola, "" Valerius, "" Belisarius "and" Portius, "wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions."</seg>
<seg id="202">"the petitions, which criticized his position on the contract of amity, trade and shipping with Britain, overcame his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he did not silence her.</seg>
<seg id="204">"freedom of speech, disagreement and discourses belong to the foundation of our nation."</seg>
<seg id="205">And true leadership means accepting this.</seg>
<seg id="206">Ronan Rafferty hopes for domestic comfort at Renaissance Club</seg>

<seg id="466">"750 years St. Hilarius-Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche, the old cemetery site in Tumlingen will be invited to a serenade on Sunday, July 16th, at 4.30 p.m."</seg>
<seg id="467">"whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius system is a popular place to stay."</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and maintenance of the oldest building in the village have made friends and patrons of tumors a matter of their concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini emphasises: "it is a unique village gem."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267 the St. Hilariuskirche was first mentioned in documents in the Württembergischer urn Manual: count Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the parish church of Tumlingen and the Vogler "at Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">"according to the proclamation of the document, on the Hill of Tumlinger, apart from the former parish church, there was also a noble courtyard to which the church or the patron saint belonged and not the other way round."</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were people living there.</seg>
<seg id="474">"as from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt from 1858, beside the lower village and the Oberdorf, which are still to be seen today in the place of the village of Tumlingen, the" "mountain" "of the third, the manorial housing-centre of the village."</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps dating back to 1600 are underlined by these historical conditions.</seg>
<seg id="476">The law of patronage originated from the early medieval equity law.</seg>
<seg id="477">"a gentleman who built a church, endowed himself with a priest, remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this church."</seg>
<seg id="478">"thus, the right to appoint a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop."</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells in the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The greatest of the two died on Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">"the newly created bell rang the first time in 1692, but later had to be handed in during World War II in 1942."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648), the windows were smashed and the bell parts were stolen."</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaking.</seg>
<seg id="484">"in 1796, French troops encamped near the church."</seg>
<seg id="485">"they broke out the pulpit and church chairs, and used them as firewood."</seg>
<seg id="486">Remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilariuskirche was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was left standing.</seg>
<seg id="490">"in the New Year's Eve in 1834, a storm split into the church tower and half of them collapsed."</seg>
<seg id="491">"to prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished."</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the existing tower was preserved as a witness of the 750-year-old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">"today, Horst Kallberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem maintain the Hilarius system as the successor of Dieter Dockhorn as successor to Dieter Dockhorn."</seg>
<seg id="494">"as organizers, the friends and promoters charge Tumlingens on Sunday, July 16, to the sixth serenade to the old cemetery to St. HilariusChapel."</seg>
<seg id="495">This is done by the combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">Headmaster Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is from 3: 30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="499">The serenity of the serenade takes place in front of the cemetery.</seg>
<seg id="500">"enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view of meadows down to the forest," the organizers provide the fantastic views. "</seg>
<seg id="501">The serenade takes place only in dry weather.</seg>
<seg id="502">The organizers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hilarius system which is of importance for tumors and hearing-gatherers.</seg>

<seg id="505">"Boisheim refuses to" see no legal precondition for the construction, and has therefore turned to the Council of Agriculture. "</seg>
<seg id="506">The Boisheim Foundation has called on Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim Nette.</seg>
<seg id="507">It is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="508">"the association argues that at the time of approval, no wind turbines could have been approved at the time of approval on 30 December 2016, since at the time in Viersen there was only a wind force concentration zone in Viersen on the border to Schwalmtal."</seg>
<seg id="509">"within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes the exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city."</seg>
<seg id="510">Such zones are intended to prevent "sparing" the landscape.</seg>
<seg id="511">"the city of Viersen had decided only a few days before by a change in the land use plan, a second wind force concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette - but which did not approve the district government of Düsseldorf, because of a fault."</seg>
<seg id="512">"due to the lack of planning legal requirements, the granted permit is still unlawful and therefore to decline," said Christoph Erkens, president of "Boisheim." "</seg>
<seg id="513">"the current state of affairs: before the summer break, the city council once again decided to enter the wind concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette; approval by the district government is still pending."</seg>
<seg id="514">"Erkens:" in this way, the issuance of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is legally excluded. "</seg>
<seg id="515">The circle confirms the receipt of the invitation.</seg>
<seg id="516">"the relevant letter has been received from the Viersen district since last week," "explained a speaker."</seg>
<seg id="517">The circle takes it for the occasion to examine the matter again.</seg>
<seg id="518">"however, they do not expect the procedure to be stopped."</seg>
<seg id="519">"in view of ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the circle on Thursday did not want to contend with the argument of the" Boisheim "association."</seg>
<seg id="520">"the NEW Re, a NEW subsidiary, plans to build four 200 metres high wind turbines on an area at the Boisheim Nette."</seg>
<seg id="521">"last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen was indirectly involved, closed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectare site."</seg>
<seg id="522">"with the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity consumption of around 11 400 households is expected to be covered - roughly one-fifth of the electricity needs of all four households."</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">"last summer, Viersen City Council gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich wind park near Aachen, as well as a stake in a wind turbine plant in Übach-Palenberg in Heinsberg."</seg>

<seg id="641">"up to this point the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, if one stands on the same country where the Lynch Morde took place, the air feels ghostly."</seg>
<seg id="642">"when the last notes of the song fade out, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the corpse."</seg>
<seg id="643">"children hock at their heads, register the bogus blood and the silent bodies and whisper one another."</seg>
<seg id="644">"they are not really dead," a little boy murmurs, as if he wanted to remember. "</seg>

<seg id="889">In 432 cases the conclusion was that the person "may be under 18 years old."</seg>
<seg id="890">The tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.</seg>
<seg id="891">"according to Johan Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been consistent over the past few months."</seg>

<seg id="893">The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged over 18 years does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied over his age.</seg>

<seg id="996">"despite his comments, the IAAF congress agreed to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) had found evidence of state-funded doping in Russia."</seg>
<seg id="997">"I thought it was a very open answer to this day, a very honest presentation," "said IAAF President Coe to reporters."</seg>
<seg id="998">The entire Council and the entire Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has recognized in itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is redesigned.</seg>
<seg id="999">CoE said he was also "delighted" that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.</seg>
<seg id="1000">"I think it was a very constructive day and I think that progress has been made, but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to re-use Russia," Coe said. "</seg>

<seg id="1122">"the rules, aimed at preventing unhindered issues of European football clubs, will not disturb Neymar's world record transfer from Spain to the French Paris-Saint Germain."</seg>
<seg id="1123">"any consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain of UEFA, as the leading organization that oversees the European game has the power to forbid crews from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament."</seg>
<seg id="1124">"financial Fair Play rules, launched in 2011 by the UEFA, mean that PSG has to prove that the transfer from Neymar has been financed without major losses."</seg>
<seg id="1125">"Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to extract the Brazilians from their contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year."</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">"PSG can certainly make the money loose, so that Neymar is underwriting and bringing it into a galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team by the power rich ruling family of Qatar."</seg>
<seg id="1128">"clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money for the acquisition of players, but must be subject to legitimate income sources enabling them to make the break-even point in their football-related business."</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA president in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"the former French player believed that clubs, who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success, effectively cheat and risked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdraw their support."</seg>
<seg id="1131">"in 2011, FFP shifted from concentration on the debt of clubs to monitoring their losses."</seg>
<seg id="1132">"the change meant that the business model, which originally used Roman Abramovich in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder matter."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"during the current three-year lease period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million."</seg>
<seg id="1134">"and although Platini fell from the presidency in disgrace in 2015, his successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to scare off excessive spending."</seg>
<seg id="1135">"certainly FFP is not dead and we will certainly intensify the rules for the future," "said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP over the past week."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount for invoicing over the duration of its contract."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the revenues for the next five years can be accounted for at EUR 44.4 million in the annual financial statements."</seg>
<seg id="1138">"the first wave of EU sanctions in 2014 has hit PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the heaviest sanctions."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"the PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (then 82 million dollars), which later dropped to EUR 20 million - and it was ordered that the team members for the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players."</seg>
<seg id="1140">UEFA is looking for clubs that could attempt to overlist their financial supervision by blowing up their income by companies associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">"while a Catalan company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not be considered legitimate."</seg>
<seg id="1142">Exactly that happened in 2014 when UEFA decided that the sponsor of the PSA was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that a portion of PSG payments to Neymar could come to Qatar via payments from the 2022 World Cup organising committee.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 have disputed that Neymar's World Cup ambassador is going to be an easy finding out for the UEFA regulators.</seg>
<seg id="1145">"the previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be even more attentive, every effort to ignore the rules."</seg>
<seg id="1146">"UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG on Neymars Transfer, on Thursday the people familiar with the situation."</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke of the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 achieved a turnover of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.</seg>

<seg id="1159">"over the past few years, Chocolat Frey has made board chocolate for Swiss."</seg>
<seg id="1160">Now the sweet collaboration is at a possible end: the airline is rewriting the order.</seg>
<seg id="1161">Swiss speaker Meike Fuhlrott confirmed on request of the news agency sda a corresponding report of the newspaper "Nordwestschweiz" from Friday.</seg>
<seg id="1162">"according to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018."</seg>

<seg id="1185">"as a cultural artefact, it is equally a parody and embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories."</seg>
<seg id="1186">But as franchise it feels like the time is short.</seg>
<seg id="1187">"first day of camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of his absurd humour (it contained an original story for a speaking tin of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin). "</seg>
<seg id="1188">"by sticking to the core of the gags - middle-aged actors play great children, who will grow up - nevertheless, they managed to win the last part of the joke."</seg>

<seg id="1206">"there are six long episodes, and the comedy is not fast or frequent."</seg>
<seg id="1207">"Comrade Detective, who has been edited to a lesser extent, could better deliver his agitprop satire, since Gregor and Iosef are always visiting the American embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two big men who devour a bunch of hamburgers."</seg>

<seg id="1262">The Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25%</seg>
<seg id="1263">"the Bank of England will probably later announce that interest rates will remain unchanged, after the weak economic growth and the weakening of inflation have dampened speculation about an increase."</seg>
<seg id="1264">The Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain sluggish when it retained the interest rates on family income in the midst of an intensifying pressure.</seg>
<seg id="1265">"the political decision-makers of the Monetary Committee (MPC) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.25%, with fewer members in this month to increase, as the weak economic growth weakened the support for an increase."</seg>
<seg id="1266">"in its quarterly inflation forecast, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6% and warned that the pressure on domestic income would continue, with inflation expected to rise to just under 3% in the fall."</seg>
<seg id="1267">But it signalized that in the coming years interest increases would be needed to bridle the inflation heated by Brexit and she said that credit costs would have to rise more than expected at the financial markets.</seg>
<seg id="1268">Members also voted to withdraw part of the Mammut economic package that was issued a year after the Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="1269">"it will require time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial means for banks from the coming February, although it was said that it is now expected that they will provide 15 billion pounds in the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling."</seg>
<seg id="1270">"the Bank said:" "in the central forecast of the MPC, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak at short notice, as pressure on the real income of households continues to strain consumption."</seg>
<seg id="1271">"at the rate of interest, she repeated that" a certain impunity of monetary policy "would be necessary for the cooling of inflation and a" somewhat bigger "extent than the markets expected."</seg>
<seg id="1272">The markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="1273">"however, the bank asserted that increases would be" "gradual" "and" "limited". ""</seg>
<seg id="1274">The Bank's growth forecasts for this and next year are expected to rise by 1.9% and 1.7% in May.</seg>
<seg id="1275">It maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1276">The Pound fell after these messages against the dollar and the euro.</seg>
<seg id="1277">The pound dropped by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and fell by 0.4% to 1.11 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="1278">"the decision to no change comes after the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened the rising expectations of an increase in interest rate, and GDP in the second quarter increased from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3%."</seg>
<seg id="1279">"growth is expected to fall by 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will recover slightly after the Bank at the end of the year."</seg>
<seg id="1280">"the latest inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households that are affected by rising inflation and marginal tax increases, as the tightening first becomes worse before it will improve."</seg>
<seg id="1281">"she added that monetary policy in the next few years cannot" "prevent" "the income statement, but she added that wages will be" "clear" "at the end of their three-year forecast."</seg>
<seg id="1282">"the economy is also strengthened by the increasing demand for British goods, which is attributable to the weak pounds, which will compensate for some of the lower consumption expenditure."</seg>
<seg id="1283">"the decision comes after a year after the lowering of interest rates to 0.25% last August following the shocking EU vote, which caused the lowering of the pounds."</seg>
<seg id="1284">The Bank estimates that it will likely take four years until this will fully reach the prices and the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1285">"before the Bank's final decision on interest rates, the call for interest rates rose as inflation increased pressure on hard pressed budgets, with three policymakers demanding an increase of 0.5% in July."</seg>
<seg id="1286">"inflation has dropped from 2.9% in June to 2.6% in June, although the Bank said it was expected to attract it again in the coming months."</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Bank said that the exceedance of its value should be attributed to the weak Pound in proportion to its goal of 2%.</seg>
<seg id="1288">"said Andrew Montlake, Director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said:" "in view of the recent downfall of swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again, as the lenders are looking silently to shops and want to end the year in a positive manner."</seg>

<seg id="1291">Patients will receive access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment after a fight in front of the High Court against the financing of the drug in the NHS.</seg>
<seg id="1292">"NHS England announced that a pre-exposure prophylaxis (prep) recorded before sexual intercourse, which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now supplied by health service via a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"he agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appeal confirmed the Supreme Court ruling last year, after which the NHS had the authority to pay for the prep despite the assertion that the local authorities should finance it."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England Chief Simon Stevens as an" "important new intervention", "while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) described it as a" decisive moment. ""</seg>
<seg id="1295">"sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to enable people to register, and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018."</seg>
<seg id="1296">Pre-exposure prophylaxis (prep) is a result of HIV preparations that are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Studies have shown that prep significantly reduces HIV transmission in infectious diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1298">To take prep before sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs in the body of a person are available to prevent HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Such medications can be taken every day or as already two hours before sexual intercourse.</seg>
<seg id="1300">"those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexual and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated."</seg>
<seg id="1301">"clinics will identify suitable candidates who agree to the study including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment."</seg>
<seg id="1302">People who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also register for possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic.</seg>
<seg id="1303">The program will be £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week following an international competitive sourcing.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"the study aims to evaluate the full potential of prep by collecting and implementing clinical evidence, as it is used in a large scale."</seg>
<seg id="1305">"Stevens said:" "this great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV."</seg>
<seg id="1306">It is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in coping with one of humanity's greatest health challenges. "</seg>
<seg id="1307">"Deborah Gold, Chief Executive Officer at NAT (National AIDS Trust) said:" "this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV."</seg>
<seg id="1308">"prep, if targeted at vulnerable and vulnerable people, provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic."</seg>
<seg id="1309">"from September onwards people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and is not subject to negotiations with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives."</seg>
<seg id="1310">We warmly welcome this announcement. "</seg>
<seg id="1311">"Ian Green, Chairman of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said:" "the priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind."</seg>
<seg id="1312">"now that prep test medicine was procured, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"Sharon Hodgson, Shadow Health Minister, said:" the beginning of the prep process is welcomed and overdue following months of delay and hesitant implementation by the government. "</seg>
<seg id="1314">The evidence shows how transformative this drug may be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transfer of this life-altering infection.</seg>
<seg id="1315">This experiment brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of prep.</seg>
<seg id="1316">"now it is important that this study will be carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV-infected, and that it will help us to step closer to the eradication of HIV in society."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Living the big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks transformed this little Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, shrank in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court apartment."</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne did not pack and sell her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," says Joanne. "</seg>
<seg id="1321">I looked for something comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">"I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings."</seg>
<seg id="1323">I fell in love with her and made an offer this day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot of the apartment has been completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-bedroom mansion with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne's storage room and mezzanine should add to use the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"that was my request," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1328">"for this purpose, she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 foot high ceilings and to create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms overlap so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating an intermediate floor in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">"Erfan had to think creatively, in order to solve the requirement."</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel works are rather complicated," he explains. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked up, without having to bend down."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"not only was it necessary to build a simple platform, but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below."</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">"for the mezzanine, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"using mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"at both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to let it work longer."</seg>
<seg id="1339">"in the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window in another room."</seg>
<seg id="1340">"at the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all cutlery and glasses by Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1341">"through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering went in," explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF-door. "</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is very important, so that when you push the door, it is very easy to slide."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day, you will sell the base - or how your property is appreciated," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on the floor size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"here, they have managed to increase the floor space while using high-quality materials that give space to its luxurious advantage."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things that you touch and which help to create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you don't dearest yourself into the electrical outlets in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">"these are important, but they do not play with your heart."</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square footage of something standard in something quite amazing.</seg>

<seg id="1356">Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty in a dispute because of one of the largest real estate imperial Victorias worth over $500 million.</seg>
<seg id="1357">"the former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and designer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul. he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and assets are to be divided."</seg>
<seg id="1358">"Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a sharp confrontation over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court."</seg>
<seg id="1359">"together with her mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars, since the family bought a shop at Smith Street, Collingwood in 1973."</seg>
<seg id="1360">"there, the Westco family founded jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores."</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for $85 million in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">"this money has been invested in real estate, and De Lutis's portfolio now includes offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt. Buller as well as shopping malls in the suburbs."</seg>
<seg id="1363">"following an agreement with her late father, Colin is described by Paul as the" main operator and the dominant personality "in the De Lutis family - about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third."</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court file states that this means that Colin owns property worth $316 million and Paul in the value of $176 million.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"the divisions proposed by Colin have left him with what I considered the best objects," he wrote in 2015 in a first affidavit. "</seg>
<seg id="1367">"last Friday, after several failed attempts, the first court hearing of the Supreme Court took place."</seg>
<seg id="1368">"the brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business, of which Colin, as Paul claims, expelled him."</seg>
<seg id="1369">"colin argues that this is not true, but introduces Paul to manage some possessions incompetent."</seg>
<seg id="1370">"in an early Affidavit, which was submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute."</seg>
<seg id="1371">"my Italian inheritance says that the family is the most important priority," he wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1372">"the costs are in the event, with hundreds of pages with affidavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and from both parties held law firms."</seg>
<seg id="1373">"Mrs. De Lutis and her dead husband Luigi were Italian immigrants, who ran dairy-bars and delicacies from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early seventies."</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used security to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the first jeans shop of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">"Colin says that he began Westco there when he was" "in my last years of High School when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="1376">"Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their property to her sons."</seg>
<seg id="1377">"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," "she wrote."</seg>
<seg id="1378">"two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis Group, although Colin claims that Mark was paid $10 million in leaving the company and Luke 26 million dollars."</seg>
<seg id="1379">"both Luke and Mark are, so Paul says about the conditions of their financial separation."</seg>
<seg id="1380">Colin has kept himself very reluctant even though he was a former AFL board member and after a biography from 2015 Eddie McGuire was the best friend of the TV star.</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1382">"just Colin answered by SMS to say" I can really not say much, "because the case is before the dishes."</seg>
<seg id="1383">"it is very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and to draw our family name through the dishes," he wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1384">In the middle of 2016 Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill his brother's demands.</seg>
<seg id="1385">"our father would not have wished that Paul and I would end up in our current dispute," he said, and added that he "still hoping for a solution." "</seg>
<seg id="1386">On Friday this hope seemed to be over.</seg>
<seg id="1387">"our matter will be solved in the near future by the courts," Colin wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1388">Trumps's new Chief of Staff is planning to limit the presidential press abstinence.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">"if so, he will be the first."</seg>
<seg id="1392">"Politico reports that the White House's new Chief of Staff is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Trump, including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a smoother course."</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with executive employees on his first working day, he represented a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House, which he wanted to repair: poor information that came into the hands of the president."</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring its media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">"President Trumps's relationship with television goes back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"when candidate Trump was angry because of unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of jobs that were to convince," "said the former campaign manager Sam Nunberg against Politico in February."</seg>
<seg id="1399">"Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" the key to keep Trumps's Twitter habit under control, "according to six former election campaigns, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay. that's ok.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these fighting officials know something we do not know - that Trumps tweets would have included even more combustible material without their intervention.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">"if his employees managed to stay away from him several times, then their efforts have been worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="1405">But nobody has consistently managed to prevent Trump's controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">"part of the problem is that people in a White House that are composed of competing parties will always try to present their own agenda by presenting Trump fabric, which may promote their views from the world."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"Politico - busy with this story, reported in May about the preference of the advisers to supply the president with dubious information for strategic reasons."</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press cuts, especially those with shameful leaks, and that he tries to figure out where they originate from."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"exactly that happened at the end of February when someone complained to the President maliciously a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh," to be the source behind a bunch of leaks "in the White House."</seg>
<seg id="1411">"although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for harassment, or that he has not offered concrete evidence or that he has voiced false allegations in the past and revoked them."</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and started asking employees about Walsh.</seg>
<seg id="1413">"gold makers added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, have tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork that Trump is receiving."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">"perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager as Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors are still striving for influence."</seg>
<seg id="1417">These immutable factors make Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1444">From Birkenhof to Waldhotel Luise</seg>
<seg id="1445">From the former Hotel Birkenhof is the Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">"because with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente company gesellschaft mbH on April 13, 2014 around 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and revenue from the tourist tax was also lost."</seg>
<seg id="1449">"in the autumn of 2014, in view of dramatic rising numbers of refugees who came to the district, the hotel building was offered to the District Council as a collective shelter, which provided controversial discussions."</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the housing of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">"at that time, the decision was not undisputed in the council."</seg>
<seg id="1452">But especially Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and spoke of serious interest in the house back then.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group Luisenhotels with managing director Birgit Scherer with its headquarters in Bad Bergzabern has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a home of the three-star Plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.</seg>
<seg id="1457">"welcome to Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise."</seg>
<seg id="1458">"the former Hotel Birkenhof has been building shuttles in front of the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the house it becomes clear what extensive renovation works will take place."</seg>
<seg id="1459">"the floors have been torn out, ceilings partly broken down, old bathtubs removed from the rooms."</seg>
<seg id="1460">The entire hotel building is a single construction site.</seg>
<seg id="1461">There is still much to be done until March.</seg>
<seg id="1462">"it's actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper. "</seg>
<seg id="1463">Everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style.</seg>
<seg id="1464">"the rooms are equipped with large walkable showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed."</seg>
<seg id="1465">Everything should later be "beautifully bourgeois" as Thomas Scherer expresses.</seg>
<seg id="1466">"we want to make a piece of jewelry."</seg>
<seg id="1467">"swimming pool, wellness area and a conference room belong to the equipment."</seg>
<seg id="1468">"one does not want to position itself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already on a upscale downtown level, Scherer points out."</seg>
<seg id="1469">"the Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wanted to spread wide, explained Scherer."</seg>
<seg id="1470">"individual vacationers, groups or businessmen should feel comfortable in the hotel."</seg>
<seg id="1471">"he has already led talks with OB Julian Osswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause, so shaver."</seg>
<seg id="1472">The performances of the city are identical to those of the hotel group.</seg>
<seg id="1473">"we are on the same line."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"according to the amount of investment required, Thomas Scherer doesn't want to determine exactly."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"just under a million euros, he reckons."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"the exterior installations are also brought to the fore, which is already clearly visible."</seg>
<seg id="1477">"in a courtyard, there is a large terrace which is accessible from the restaurant that is open to the public."</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia-Affair: us Special Eagle sets up Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">"in the Russia affair around US President Donald Trump, special investigator Robert Mueller is said to have used a so-called Grand Jury after a report."</seg>
<seg id="1481">"in recent weeks, the Panel has recorded the work, wrote the Wall Street Journal, calling on people familiar with the matter."</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper read the step as a sign that Mueller has expanded and intensified his investigations.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"CNN reported that there are already first allegations of the body in connection with a meeting between Trumps, the oldest son and a Russian lawyer."</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. secret services accuse the Kremlin for quite some time to deliberately interfered with in the 2016 presidential election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller investigated whether there were agreements between Trumps campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">The investigation should focus on several men who acted as advisors to the republicans in the election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1487">"according to reports, Mueller also examined more and more trump private and business environment under the microscope."</seg>
<seg id="1488">"a few weeks ago, the" Washington Post "wrote that the Special investigator Trump personally moved to the centre and investigates whether the President may have impeded the judiciary in the wake of the affair."</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jury is to examine present evidence in possible crime scenes and decide whether charges should be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">"therefore, Grand jurys are also called" "Indictines". ""</seg>
<seg id="1491">"most of the time, they are switched on when it comes to larger and controversial cases."</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always done behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The committee can also be turned on by the public prosecutor to invite people to interrogation under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"according to the Sender CNN, pre-invitations have already been issued, which revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"people who were involved in the meeting were asked to testify, called it in the report."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"in addition, they should provide documents."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"in addition to Trump Jr., Trumps adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner, as well as his team Principal Paul Manafort, were talking about this."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"legal experts said on Thursday evening in the U.S. television that the substitution show that Mueller would not be intimidated in his work, and that if necessary, he would act quickly."</seg>
<seg id="1499">"however, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the charge of an indictment."</seg>
<seg id="1500">"however, the establishment of the Greyum is the beginning of a new phase in the investigation and a new reason for President Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1501">"in the midst of the new revelations, the President, on Thursday evening, used a speech in West Virginia to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents."</seg>
<seg id="1502">"Russia's history is a total invention," Trump said. "</seg>
<seg id="1503">The theme gives the Democrats an opportunity to feel good because they have nothing else to talk about.</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special Advisor Ty Cobb explained in a statement that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"but this also works in secret, he emphasised."</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House justifies any measures which accelerated the work of the special agent in "fair" ways.</seg>
<seg id="1507">Former FBI chief James Comey stated three times that he will not be determined against the president.</seg>
<seg id="1508">"I have no reason to accept that something has changed in it, it was mentioned in the explanation."</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller had only been employed after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"because of this allegation, allegations against Trump had become loud, he would like to hinder the judiciary."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"Comey said in June in front of a Senate Committee, Trump asked him to set up an investigation against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn."</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"following the presentation of US media, the White House gathered material against the Sonderfonds and its employees."</seg>
<seg id="1514">This triggered speculation about whether Trump Mueller would be fired.</seg>
<seg id="1515">"unlike an independent investigator of the Congress, such as the Watergate affair surrounding the later recalled President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired on the urges of the President of the Ministry of Justice."</seg>
<seg id="1516">"however, several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step."</seg>
<seg id="1517">"two groups of Republican and Democratic Senators submitted legislative proposals on Thursday, after which the special investigator could no longer be dismissed so easily."</seg>
<seg id="1518">Antarctica: giant iceberg drives in Antarctica</seg>
<seg id="1519">"in the Western Antarctic, a giant iceberg of the barely seven-fold size of Berlin detached from the shelf."</seg>
<seg id="1520">This was confirmed by the Bremerhavener Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"the one trillion tons heavy and 5800 square kilometers of large colossus is now driving north and will probably need two, three years until it is melted."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"with a length of 175 km and a width of up to 50 kilometers, it is one of the biggest ice giants that researchers have recorded over the past three decades."</seg>
<seg id="1523">A danger for human beings does not emanate from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">The extent to which climate change has played a role in the demolition of the iceberg is unclear according to research findings.</seg>
<seg id="1525">"however, for nearly 30 years, there have been a series of unusual collisions of ice cream cones in the region, writes the US research centre for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a background."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"according to many researchers, this can be related to global warming."</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken down colossus has been part of the Larsen-C-Schelven so far.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelbög swims on the sea and is fed by big glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It therefore continues to grow into the sea and breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelven is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">"in the north of this ice shelf, the equilibrium of waxes and abrupt was disrupted several years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1532">AWI researcher Daniela Jansen writes a complete Schelven's event.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"there is a lot to say that the Larsen-C-Schelven is in danger, as the front edge has never pulled back as far as it is at present."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"in addition, the ice sheet is under tension and can be broken if a piece breaks down at a key point."</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of ice shelf and iceberg does not increase the sea level as it dries on the water and glaciers so much water as it produces after melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">"however, the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"this could possibly increase the sea level, but only to a small extent, writes the British research project to observe Antarctica (Midas)."</seg>
<seg id="1538">"according to AWI data, the Larsen-C-Schelven is the fourth-largest shelf of Antarctica with almost 50 000 square kilometres."</seg>
<seg id="1539">"at the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean approximately 200 metres."</seg>
<seg id="1540">It breaks regularly there.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural occurrence and no direct link to climate change is aware of us, the ice shield now enters a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University. "</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the most farthest retreat since the beginning of the records," he too confirmed. "</seg>
<seg id="1543">"scientists are controversial whether the Larsen-C Schelven will now grow back or go back in the long run, and possibly collapsed, his colleague Adrian Luckman said," Our models say it will be less stable. "</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"even if these researchers fail to bring this gigantic iceberg back to climate change, the Antarctic Peninsula has been falling apart during the last decades."</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long top of the Antarctic stretches towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">"according to the research program British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has decreased by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s."</seg>
<seg id="1548">The decline in temperature has contributed to this decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed up around three degrees in the past 50 years and is thus one of the areas in which the temperature is the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants Haustarif at the personnel</seg>
<seg id="1551">"because it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill vacant jobs, the CDU asks to leave the Employers' Association to become more attractive."</seg>
<seg id="1552">"only shortly before the summer break, 41 new jobs in the administration have gone through in the administration."</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">"now, 17 trainees have left their first working day."</seg>
<seg id="1555">The apprenticeships at the circle are obviously very sought after.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Around 620 applications had been submitted for the places to be awarded this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">"nevertheless, the circle continues to lack personnel to cope with the increased demands and challenges."</seg>
<seg id="1558">"currently, there are still 50 unoccupied places in the Mettmann district."</seg>
<seg id="1559">"among other things, the search for physicians and engineers as well as the forces of general administration are sought."</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"according to the parties' request, the administration will develop a concept for personnel recruitment and personnel development."</seg>
<seg id="1562">"the aim is to not only cover short-term requirements for skilled workers, but to counteract the future-oriented candidate shortage."</seg>
<seg id="1563">"the overall concept should orientate themselves both internally and externally, outline specific measures for crosscendants and include a training offensive, call for CDU, FDP and UWG."</seg>
<seg id="1564">This sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn't know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">The speech is from a regular "competition of the public employer."</seg>
<seg id="1568">"for this purpose, a high number of employees have to leave the service due to illness or age-related reasons."</seg>
<seg id="1569">So it's time to take action so that no more places remain unoccupied.</seg>
<seg id="1570">"but Klaus-Dieter Völker, group leader of the CDU, goes beyond the common application with his party."</seg>
<seg id="1571">"already in the circle of the circle, he had caused a fist big surprise when he publicly challenged the personnel expenses and the remaining parties baffled."</seg>
<seg id="1572">People want all the possibilities to be reviewed which allow a withdrawal from the communal employers' association.</seg>
<seg id="1573">"if we do not come to a satisfactory solution here at short notice, the administration of the county with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county-affiliated towns - should strive for a tariff," "people."</seg>
<seg id="1574">"in doing so, the CDU tries to pay better the employees and officials than it actually foresees the tariff for the public service."</seg>
<seg id="1575">"the salaries are currently exactly prescribed, increases or more money are only available if you change to a higher level that is oriented towards career years."</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more over the past few years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">"only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Prostitution Act."</seg>
<seg id="1578">"not least because of the rising number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendrix and Kreisdirektor Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little staff."</seg>
<seg id="1579">Italy tightened the tone of NGO migrants</seg>
<seg id="1580">"in Italy, NGOs who use rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean have warned that they are not allowed to continue this if they do not comply with new rules for their operations."</seg>
<seg id="1581">"if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue working," "said Home Secretary Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa."</seg>
<seg id="1582">"Minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German aid organisation 'Youth Rettet', because their crew had worked effectively with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration."</seg>
<seg id="1583">"the relief organisation, which has only been in operation for one year, refused to express extensive allegations of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio."</seg>
<seg id="1584">"we are so sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," "said the organisation in a statement on social media."</seg>
<seg id="1585">We can only judge all accusations raised at present after we have collected all the information and assess the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1586">"the Italian authorities had monitored the boat of 'Youth Rettet', the Iuventa, since October."</seg>
<seg id="1587">"it is assumed that its crew takes dinghy migrants on board, which are delivered directly by traffickers, and that the smugglers can depart so that the ships can be used again."</seg>
<seg id="1588">"at least one such meeting supposedly took place only 1,3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the acts of the prosecutor, whose content was published by Italian media."</seg>
<seg id="1589">"the occupation is suspected of overriding the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives."</seg>
<seg id="1590">"under the Code of Conduct, boats like the Iuventa above all must have an Italian police officer who monitors their activities."</seg>
<seg id="1591">"only three of the nine NGOs participating in search and rescue missions have previously agreed to adhere to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain."</seg>
<seg id="1592">"the latter announced on Thursday that the new rules would be deemed unnecessary, but acceptable as they would not bring any" significant changes or disabilities "to their rescue operations."</seg>
<seg id="1593">Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).</seg>
<seg id="1594">"in the meantime, Minniti has said that the number of migrants arrived in Italy after the rescue operations has gone back in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguards and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit."</seg>
<seg id="1595">"in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," "said the minister."</seg>
<seg id="1596">"he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe."</seg>
<seg id="1597">Ascents and Trials</seg>
<seg id="1598">"nine visionary bikers, the" Berliner Outpost "and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the northern Palatinate to enjoy trials and sightseeings for four days."</seg>
<seg id="1599">There were three friendly guides available for this.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The Burgundy and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour led to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim on hot summer temperatures.</seg>
<seg id="1603">"viewpoints followed, partly on towers, from which one could see far beyond the Pfälzer forest and the upstream plains."</seg>
<seg id="1604">"in between there was always a longer ascents, for the long trials rewarded."</seg>
<seg id="1605">"on the second day, it went to Bad Dürkheim to Saline and to the folk festival sausage market."</seg>
<seg id="1606">"again, looking at the lookout point, connected by" "flowered" "trials and moderate ascents."</seg>
<seg id="1607">During the last two days a lot of altimeters were announced.</seg>
<seg id="1608">"caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and refuges brought welcome breaks."</seg>
<seg id="1609">In Bad Dürkheim the bikers atmete healing brine in the open-air inhalatorium.</seg>

<seg id="1613">Are the sports stars in the future sitting in front of computer consoles instead of sweating through the stadium racing with wind and weather?</seg>
<seg id="1614">"fact is: e-Sports has long become a serious business, becoming a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gauges included."</seg>
<seg id="1615">"the first federal ligaversts, who are increasingly involved in this area, have also recognised this."</seg>
<seg id="1616">"the beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and finally the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an E-Sport department in mid-July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17."</seg>
<seg id="1617">"we hope to enthuse new young target groups for the VfB," says managing director Jochen Röttgermann. "</seg>
<seg id="1618">"he is sure," "that there are still some clubs on this train."</seg>
<seg id="1619">"next weekend, FIFA World Cup football club organises the first" Interactive Club World Cup, "where the gamers of different clubs compete against each other."</seg>
<seg id="1620">"in addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven qualified."</seg>

<seg id="1624">"and: the clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets, especially the Asian ones."</seg>
<seg id="1625">"with prominent electric sportsmen under contract, you could be more often present on these markets online than just once a year to send the German embassy to Asia."</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it all about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">"during e-sport, computer games such as" League Of Legends, "" Dota 2, "" Counterstrike "or the football simulation FIFA championed FIFA at a competitive level."</seg>
<seg id="1628">"as in normal sports, leagues have long since established themselves in which the professionals compete against each other."</seg>
<seg id="1629">"and in the Asian Games 2022, e-sport is already part of the official programme."</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it a proper sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">"for many, the performance is certainly getting used."</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobbers has long been dealing with the question.</seg>
<seg id="1633">"for Professor at the German Sport University in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in the classical sport - for example increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes."</seg>
<seg id="1634">"in addition, cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and rapid response ability."</seg>
<seg id="1635">Professional gamers ought not only to exercise on the console but also their bodies and pay attention to their diet.</seg>
<seg id="1636">"the fit player is a good player."</seg>
<seg id="1637">But acrobats also have problems: "doping becomes more and more a topic."</seg>
<seg id="1638">"checks are difficult for online games, and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing."</seg>
<seg id="1639">The scientist clearly highlights the high integrative effect of the E-Sports.</seg>
<seg id="1640">"players are on the move internationally, this is like a big global family, there are no cross-cultural barriers."</seg>
<seg id="1641">A study by the management consultancy Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in the E-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1642">"in 2016, 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsoring and big tourneys."</seg>
<seg id="1643">"in three years, sales are expected to reach 130 million."</seg>
<seg id="1644">"against the almost 2.4 billion Euro of the Bundesliga, this is little."</seg>
<seg id="1645">"however, the E-sport is no longer far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," the Deloitte advisers write. "</seg>
<seg id="1646">Many countries are already on the international level.</seg>

<seg id="1662">A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boyfriend through texts and calls to commit suicide.</seg>
<seg id="1663">"Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her condemnation behind bars and five years have been exposed to probation."</seg>
<seg id="1664">Carter was sentenced in June due to the negligent murder of Conrad Roy who took life on 13 July 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1665">"the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing," "My family is innocent."</seg>
<seg id="1666">My son was my best friend. "</seg>
<seg id="1667">Carter was allowed to remain vacant until his appointment.</seg>
<seg id="1668">"she had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had suffered from a mental illness."</seg>
<seg id="1669">"dressed in red trousers and a cream-colored blouse, Carter stood there with tears in her eyes, with folded hands and downwards, when she was condemned."</seg>
<seg id="1670">"her actions have killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor said to the court. "</seg>
<seg id="1671">She finished his life in order to make her own better.</seg>
<seg id="1672">"she has no responsibility," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="1673">"she has not shown any regret."</seg>
<seg id="1674">"but Carter's lawyer said it was a" "awful circumstance that she completely regrets." ""</seg>
<seg id="1675">"judges Lawrence Moniz, however, said he did not figure out that their" age or maturity "or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"a prosecutor had read a statement by Roy's mother Lynn Roy, saying that there is" no day "in which I do not mourn the loss of my beloved Son."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything. I try to be there for his sisters, in spite of all my pain, which we will carry with us for eternity."</seg>
<seg id="1678">"Roys sister, Camdyn Roy, said that she would be" persecuted "by the realization that she would never take part in her brother's wedding or be a aunt for his children."</seg>
<seg id="1679">"no longer have this single person with whom I have been together every day since my birth, is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="1680">"the case appears to be a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts, which makes it a crime to challenge another to commit suicide."</seg>
<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1682">"the case drew national attention, after Carter's text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"hang up, jump from a building, get yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," "she said in several news that she had sent in the two weeks before his death, while he was on vacation with his family."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"in the moments before his suicide, she wrote:" "you have to do it, Conrad" "and" "All you have to do is to turn on the generator and you will be free and happy." ""</seg>
<seg id="1685">Judge Moniz told Carter's attention went through the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from the case by any press.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The case has divided the legal opinion.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"one of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 due to murder of her British cohabitation in Italy before she was acquitted two years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1688">"Ms. Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times:" Michelle Carter earns sympathy and help, not jail. "</seg>

<seg id="1690">"that Joshua Kimberley was allowed to run as a captain at the Audi Cup, is not a coincidence."</seg>
<seg id="1691">The FC Bayern takes a big season to the Confed-Cup winner - extra motivation does not hurt.</seg>
<seg id="1692">"something was different on his seat in the cabin, which Joshua saw immediately, even if the extra piece of clothing was very, very small."</seg>
<seg id="1693">"but as far and wide on the second day of Audi's Cup, of course, no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer had to be seen, he made a rush to his arm."</seg>
<seg id="1694">"the coach did not say it," said the Confed-Cup winner afterwards, after his first assignment as a Bavarian captain. "</seg>
<seg id="1695">"well, the setting could have run better than at 0: 2 against the SSC Naples."</seg>
<seg id="1696">But the character of the coach was able to interpret Kimberk as well.</seg>
<seg id="1697">"not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal had been chosen as a game leader in the C-Elf, consisting of youth players, debutants and especially from the holiday."</seg>
<seg id="1698">It is preferable to distribute sugar to those who want to entertain a lot that you want to keep in a mood.</seg>
<seg id="1699">"so, who was chosen to compete with the legacy of Lahm, can only use a little extra motivation."</seg>
<seg id="1700">Kimberich confirmed: "this is what you want as a player: take responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"on Wednesday, the 22-year-old flowed as a mini-undertook over the field."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"right behind, this is his position, the white bandage at the arm did her rest."</seg>
<seg id="1703">"and in general, Kimberley looked like the one who can take the helm in his hand."</seg>
<seg id="1704">"he gave instructions, tried to direct the unwell played troupe."</seg>
<seg id="1705">"he had a look for the whole, while many others were busy himself."</seg>
<seg id="1706">"Vidal thus manages to replay his missing fitness (hardly worked); Renato Sanches thus, on the devil, come out to the achievements of Asia's journey (also only conditionally); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle do not negatively fall into their first appearance in the Bayern Tricot."</seg>
<seg id="1707">But all this worked quite well.</seg>
<seg id="1708">"in addition Kimberich, Rudy ran off against the defense, both acted confidently."</seg>
<seg id="1709">"the namiably occupied Napoli storm was often difficult, and Süle was also successful in playing the game a few times."</seg>
<seg id="1710">"his colleague Rudy said that" "the result" "wasn't as we hoped for."</seg>
<seg id="1711">But he too showed a decent performance during the debut.</seg>
<seg id="1712">"game relocation, tempo change:" for this style, I was also brought up. ""</seg>
<seg id="1713">"how unusual this Bayern world is still for the newcomers, one soon saw the game."</seg>
<seg id="1714">"for example, in the catacombs, Rudy did not give one or two, but determined six or seven interviews."</seg>
<seg id="1715">Kimberley said goodbye to his new fellow players after a few crisp statements.</seg>
<seg id="1716">"there he heard of Süle an interesting phrase:" "what is going on here, I have already noticed."</seg>
<seg id="1717">"in Bavaria, you just have to win every game." "</seg>

<seg id="1727">This is evident after more than a year in which the new Minister Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.</seg>
<seg id="1728">Chambers and companies from the region speak on T V request of a change in economic policy - and at the same time blame the old ministerial council.</seg>

<seg id="1730">"the largest turnaround, of course, is in the infrastructure policy: the gap of the highway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country's priority list."</seg>
<seg id="1731">"this year, the ministry is hoping for a planning process, until 2021 is expected to be the construction law."</seg>
<seg id="1732">"in the country's plans, the West Bank also plays a role in the country's plans."</seg>
<seg id="1733">"the aim is to take the route in operation in December 2020, says Ministerial spokesperson Cornelia Holtmann."</seg>
<seg id="1734">"natus sees in it a signpost to support regional, but internationally competing companies."</seg>
<seg id="1735">"as from Wissing, the Chamber of Industry and Commerce (Chamber of Commerce) strives to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports since ten years."</seg>

<seg id="1740">"with the planned road construction, there are quick facts to be created; at the same time it lacks the necessary personnel, says Jan Bell auer, the main managing director of the IHK Trier."</seg>

<seg id="1798">"Eric Chaisse, Expert of the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in Provence, said:" "the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change over the past few years, which in the spring has brought much less rain and in autumn much more."</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">"there is also a small zikade, a micro-bacterium that transmits dwarf-cicadas, and in very dry weather there are many of them."</seg>
<seg id="1801">And there is much in the game.</seg>
<seg id="1802">"lavender oil is not only tempting for vacationers, it is also very popular for perfumes and cosmetics."</seg>
<seg id="1803">"Eric Chaisse said:" instead of having very long plant oars with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened. "</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">"the employees of the weekly Riodoce usually meet Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the State of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials, and incessant drugs wars."</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-level journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children into the office, who were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"security experts have written three words onto a table at the front of the room: opponents, Neutral, Allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"they ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and gut feelings."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the payroll of government or cartels, a catalog of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no rest of the violence, and while the bodies are piling up throughout the country, more and more journalists are involved: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto has taken office in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection and until now there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries this year."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter is her editor and her inspiration from Riodosice, co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," "wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1820">"his absence is felt deep, although his presence is present everywhere - a great photo of Valdez, pointing out his middle finger with the word" Justice, "hung on the facade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts, showing his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although a special federal prosecutor's office was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists, it has only initiated two criminal proceedings to protect journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most thousands of murders committed every year with drug trafficking and organised crime, the murderers of journalists are rarely brought to justice."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"at Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa although they are intraterally and although the terrain is now even more treacherous."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting for the discussion of safety has little benefit, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we don't know the why, we distrust everyone."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"on the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodolce in Culiacan's capital."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he only managed to drive a few blocks until his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with" Twelve River. ""</seg>
<seg id="1830">The Sagittarius drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a wife and two grown-up children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumours tend to fly around freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">"but, on the subject of Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence."</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzman's arrest last year and the extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country, as rival factions fight here to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it does not matter that in Sinaloa each day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-storey mausoleums for drug queens, which are larger than many homes for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">"forget for a minute that there is a state of" "peace" "if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable harbours and drug trade routes in the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1838">"despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodosice, broke with the blame that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first, in February the publication of an interview with Damasco Lopez, a leader of a rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzman's sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may have annoyed the sons, assumed gang members bought every copy of the issue, as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kiosks."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second mistake was to not force Valdez, after the confiscation of another newspaper, which had published the same story to leave the country for its own security."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had so long survived that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">"he worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he combined with five colleagues to establish Riodoce and sold 50 USD Investments."</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa," it was impossible to operate journalism without encountering the intoxication problem, "said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1847">"over time, the newspaper has earned a reputation because of bold and honest reporting, and sales and advertising."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporters loved it to be able to publish hard-fitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to handle."</seg>
<seg id="1849">"eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious" Maria-Moors-Cabot Award "for her coverage in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award 'of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his Courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history, wherever it led."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He volunteered to be afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I would like to continue living," he said at the time of the CPJ award. "</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug trafficking in Sinaloa" is a way of life, "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV."</seg>
<seg id="1854">You have to take over the task that you as a journalist falls - either that or you play the dummy.</seg>
<seg id="1855">I don't want to be asked: "what have you done in the face of so many dead... why didn't you say what was going on?</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Rifuce-Team misses Valdez, the fun-bird that could curse as a port worker, the friend, who was generously with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">"now they ask," "Is his love for routine destruction?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1861">"his death, too, forced them to question their own assumptions about how to best do their job and stay alive."</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret wings and runways in order to move drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation."</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it smells erroneous, stay away from it."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the anger is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that" "smell is a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing is happening with Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"days before it became known that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">"outside, two policemen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree."</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a mid-size neighborhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the joke, some of the reporters asked if these officers were among the 50 per cent of the police officers who were not trustworthy of the governor."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months since the reporters have gone to the mountains, where the drug gangs are de facto under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">"for the edition of this week, Riodolce has spent three main stories."</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the former well-known Boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the state expenditures concentrated on the hometown of the governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">"there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor, conducting a kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone knows in the city: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the reigning Institutional Revolution Party (PRI) which ruled almost the entire century all the political levels.</seg>
<seg id="1881">"recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-caliber cases of corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this locality, including one in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman escaped a military attack."</seg>
<seg id="1883">"only a few months earlier, the readers would have viewed the column of Valdez as the best informed source of abduction."</seg>
<seg id="1884">"in the past, we had known what happened," "said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname" El Flaco "because of his slender body."</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication are broken with our sources."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"Valdez's office became a storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the killings of journalists, because the employees have become something they never expected: activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez snapped a few signs and went to a demonstration in the next morning for a further journalist to the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">"Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western state of Michoacan."</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body has been discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is his.</seg>
<seg id="1890">"throughout the country, journalists have become louder by writing in organized protests" SOS Press "on pavements and buildings."</seg>
<seg id="1891">"on this day, director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to gather international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"at a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to spy on journalists and kill them because they said the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">Since then she has asked her to be re-divided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were" "surrounded" "by organised crime, government officials and a similar society."</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" Narco-Journalism, "he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the order of politicians and security forces, who put together with organised crime under a blanket."</seg>
<seg id="1896">"last year, the media group" Articulo 19 "has been assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of police and officials."</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth," "said Ramirez."</seg>
<seg id="1898">Evidently the murders have a deterrent effect.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Nobody forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">"her body was found along with a note that was allegedly signed by the Zetas-Kartell:" "here I am because of my reports."</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and headphones lie next to their separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">"some branches have chosen to close, like the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the assassination of the correspondent Miroslav Breach in March."</seg>
<seg id="1903">"others continue, as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of her director in 2004."</seg>
<seg id="1904">"in 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an article on the title page entitled" What do you want from us? ""</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists fled from their home countries or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"it is hard to find work in exile, and they still watch the streets and look for dangers."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"and sometimes they are hunted, as apparently the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz."</seg>
<seg id="1909">"for those who stay behind and continue their work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1910">"Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, indicates that drug trafficking is frightened."</seg>

<seg id="1912">"at midnight on the last Friday, when the last issue was already finished, the editors of Riodoce sat on the pavement in front of the office and drank beer, when suddenly all their phones began to buzz."</seg>
<seg id="1913">A number of shootings with Bandenrivals and security forces near the Mazatlan seaside resort had left 19 confirmed dead.</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war continued escalating as promised by a series of cartel messages in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1915">From the curb edge they released the news on the website of Riodok via mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The title page had to be changed the next day.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Sirens stay close to - another shooting in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Bojorquez threw a look at the police officers who kept guard to see if they were in readiness.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"if they were afraid at all, they did not show it."</seg>
<seg id="1920">"under the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible for all Sinaloa, the employees of Riodoce followed their marks."</seg>
<seg id="1921">"how can you just think about it," "said Bojorquez," "if on the same day Javier was murdered, the trainee asked me to send her to the street."</seg>
<seg id="1922">Dinosaurs used camouflage to evade his enemies</seg>
<seg id="1923">"at first sight, it looks like a statue, albeit a frightening one."</seg>
<seg id="1924">Researchers have now found out that the first findings of the incredible rhinoceros of a Canadian mountain worker were so well preserved that experts described it as "Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1925">It was so well received that they could even notice that his scaly skin was of reddish brown - and they said that she had had something of an "troubled past."</seg>
<seg id="1926">"the report in the journal" Current Biology "described it as" the best preserved dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world. "</seg>
<seg id="1927">The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodose ridinals living in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1928">"his amazingly well-preserved state has startled researchers, who describe it as" truly remarkable, ""</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic the armoured herbivores is the best preserved fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">"Shawn Funk was found to be found near Fort McMurray in the North of Alberta, Canada on March 21st, 2011."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met something that would fail from the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years trying to uncover the wild beast within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) heavy earth clumping."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you only blinking a little with your eyes, you could almost believe it was sleeping," "said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is to be seen."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs, the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaur."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers have found out that this herbivorous, although it is covered with an armor and resembles a changing tank, probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the heavily armoured dinosaurs used a red and white cloak to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counter-shading, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this would have allowed him to better interfere with his surroundings and evade his enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by major dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of the Noiraurier made headlines for the first time in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers now studied the wild animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours with it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the counter shading, widespread defense in the animal kingdom, which means that the head of the creature was darker than its underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the shading is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta by far exceeds the animals living today."</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaur was hunted by sufficient pressure by eating meat eating dinosaurs that evolution favored the disguise of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most contemporary animals that use the counter shading - think of deer, zebras or armadillos - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loot, which signals that this Nodosaurier was a real fight for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur carnivores must have been the Cretaceous period," Brown said. "</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also indicates that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to investigate the animal on information about his life, including his preserved intestinal content, to find out what it has eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaurs, when he died, got into a river and driven into the sea, where he sank on the back to the bottom of the sea."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time Alberta was as warm as southern florida today, and rivers and oceans are likely far more inland than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this nodose-carrier is really remarkable, because it is completely covered with preservative skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal," Brown said. "</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal today looks almost exactly the same as in the early Cretaceous period.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you do not need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. if you just look a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it's going to sleep."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the Cretaceous period was a time when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaur, who stood on two legs crossed the earth."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six tons heavy monster."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and mummified in mud."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk, on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the North of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the preserved armored dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely removed from the muzzle to the hip."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the creatures were about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips that were raged by his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored herbivores have been swept through Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the marine litter of the dinosaur kept his armour in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remnants of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the house-stallions still cover bumpy armoured plates along the dinosaur.</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is so rare as a win in the lottery."</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I see it, the more confusing it becomes."</seg>
<seg id="1968">"petrified remnants of the skin still cover the bumpy armoured plates, which carry the skull of the animal."</seg>
<seg id="1969">"his right forefoot lies on his side, his five fingers are spread upward."</seg>
<seg id="1970">I can count the scales on his sole.</seg>

<seg id="1977">"it was a matter of mild to moderate injuries, said a police spokesman."</seg>
<seg id="1978">A large supply of rescue vehicles was at the accident site.</seg>

<seg id="1987">It's a moment that almost everyone has experienced once: nothing at all is sitting in the train and sleeping.</seg>

<seg id="1996">"if the offer comes, we expand it."</seg>
<seg id="1997">"it will then be available in Germany at the beginning of next year," "said a railway spokesman."</seg>
<seg id="1998">"" "comfort Check-in" "calls the train the ticket devaluation without Schaffner."</seg>
<seg id="1999">"to be able to use this, however, some requirements need to be met: you need a smartphone or tablet."</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to book an online ticket - what most passengers do anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2001">"it is also necessary to have the app by train, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way of ticket booking anyway."</seg>
<seg id="2002">And last but not least you need a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">"because the" "Comfort check-in" "works: one climbs into the train, calling his ticket under" "My Tickets". ""</seg>
<seg id="2004">A button for electronic devaluation will then appear with the test customers.</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train attendant will receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">"if the train driver arrives at the ticket inspector in place Y, he knows that there is a passenger with already paid on-the-line ticket."</seg>
<seg id="2007">"so you can continue to sleep, work on, keep silent."</seg>
<seg id="2008">"check-in has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should take advantage of passengers."</seg>
<seg id="2009">"if you want to travel without ticket control by our train attendant, the DB Navigator simply checks for yourself."</seg>
<seg id="2010">"this enables passengers to personalize their travel time by train," says Michael Peterson, DB Fernverkehr "Marketing Director."</seg>
<seg id="2011">"second plus:" "and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs."</seg>
<seg id="2012">"those who travel by train often know that in addition to delays and missed features, ticket inspections are among the biggest offenders."</seg>
<seg id="2013">"for often, in any case one of the contributors does not have all the documents required to devaluation online tickets."</seg>
<seg id="2014">"either the credit card or the ID card or otherwise a document, which must be referenced."</seg>
<seg id="2015">"the result is endless discussions between train attendant and passenger, leading to bad mood in the part or greater space and delays in controlling one's ticket and taking the time to take care of other matters."</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">And that also applies only to the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.</seg>

<seg id="2023">"the police have just killed a 18-year-old child, and it is still on the street," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2024">"confused as nobody else posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly being prayed on their timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"the rapper from the area of St. Louis was killed, the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo., killed live."</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body which was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"that's wild," Ferrell thought. "</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She put off her mobile phone to return later in the evening to tweets about people on the Canfield Drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos of police and people crying, and of a man claiming to be Browns's father who wore a shield with the inscription:" "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">"she watched a live feed, where a police officer stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog."</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said, another policeman secured his gun and shouted," I will kill you... animals kill all. ""</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not common," Ferrell recalled to her statement. "</seg>
<seg id="2035">This is not the kind of murder we got used to and which we can call typical.</seg>
<seg id="2036">At this moment I felt shivers.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">They booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">"after the landing at 11 pm, she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning."</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the subject of a new documentary film," Whose Streets?, "in cinemas from the 11th."</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience, which consists of the view of the people who live in the community and filled the streets to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"when Ferrell came to Ferguson with her daughter, who wore a flower-dress and a matching crown, the two discussed a conversation that she had" "the black experience and the black state" "countless times before this morning."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember, how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "she remembered what she said."</seg>
<seg id="2044">"we now go to Ferguson, because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right."</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take her away," "Ferrell said later."</seg>
<seg id="2046">What has happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know it and see it and be reared in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves in order to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I have the good fortune to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience blatant racism, she is no different from the next black women's child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">I feel I would give her a bad service to keep her away from it.</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was on the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police office, which became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-charge of officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"there, Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who had lunch."</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared the bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">"slowly, a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell's figure."</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism totally changed after 9 August," she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association, concentrating on food justice and health inequalities in black communities. "</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Everything has come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan during an evening demonstration, one of the film directors of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to" "document" "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question came to Ferrell:" "do you want to document or try to find a story that you can take advantage of?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often by whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan recently stated in an interview," We had heard that people born and grown up in Ferguson did not center their voices and we wanted to do it differently. "</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan already collaborated with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around death-killing occupants."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"his commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other indigenous people followed the team of" Whose Streets? "in the years after Browning's shooting."</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks or speaks to us. we're talking," "said Davis."</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me, as these people are represented, for so I shall be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was not to concentrate on Ferrells's experience - to show that it is not a Messiah guide, but a community that comes together," "said Folayan - she proved to be the most obvious participant in the film."</seg>
<seg id="2068">"as a result, documents of" Whose Streets? "surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrells live as she falls in love and married her wife."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," "Ferrell said and laughed as she saw the finished product for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I understand that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and in the dehumanization of black people.</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferrells's history repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives-Matter movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, which after killing the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, marked the film" Blacklive Matter "in social media, identify themselves as gay."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether," said Ferrel, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women have to carry the main burden of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"Folayan agreed to note that" "the movement was held upright by black women and many black women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it insists that" this is not an affirmative type of action, "when Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who shook this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is no accident, even though it was at the forefront, because in a life at these junctions as a black gay woman is so much on the game."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel your energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"in the meantime, the intelligence eras in Ferguson have disappeared long ago, but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on parole for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">"however, she clings to a song and she feels committed to this memory since she went to the street in Ferguson three years ago."</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We have to love and support one another.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "megalomania": TV readers to discuss bit gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">"the bit gallery moves people, even though it has not been built for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping mall at the south end of the pedestrian zone splits the population into proponents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">There is hardly any cold on the subject.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"while the one to the bit gallery says," This would be a dream "(Anja Becker) or" This would be really great "(Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side:" don't need a person "(Siggi Betzen) or simply:" megalomania! "(Lars Scholz)."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while proponents build that a gallery is attracting more customers into the city, the other businesses also fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"in addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the property where the farmers market hall stands, in which 13 direct markets offer their products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">It will be concluded with the start of the construction work.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The gallery-makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - for Beda-Platz with possibility to sit outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Room: "we have been selling in the farmers market almost every week for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the farm women are always very happy again."</seg>
<seg id="2100">We have also discovered the butcher's shop for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like to see that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is also this.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether direct marketing resettings in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">"however, the new project will probably not be very low." "</seg>
<seg id="2106">"Eva Kilic:" "what's your favorite in Bitburg?"</seg>
<seg id="2107">"clothing, shoes, drugstore or supermarkets: I find that superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There is already enough of this in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but since there is not even a regular weekly market here, it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the goods offered there are fresh, is mostly offered directly by the producer and is cheap at the top."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you can see, shop shops are only rented by larger companies in a shopping mall, because the rental companies are often not portable for retailers."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"it's a pity, there are almost no special deals and that which is left of it will probably disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping mall with a market hall doesn't fit for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">"above all, where is the farmer's market hall to go during construction?"</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run when the bit gallery actually comes.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does it create the ghost bit gallery before selling all the stores from Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "that won't work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping center, which stands empty, no one needs."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real peasant market instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"but for a farmer's market hall, thanks to the insanely many - as I find - meaningless building projects in Bitburg no longer room."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"when the farmer's market hall is destroyed, a piece of culture will disappear again."</seg>
<seg id="2124">Matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are to be seen - white, black and brown, which are almost inconspicuous - hanging at cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tuppers and haircuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent cuts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst banished a 35-year prison term after publicly disclosed diplomatic news about the WikiLeaks website."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition, which was opened on August 2, is called A Becoming Stresemblance."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"she is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer sciences and art, and Manning, a Transwoman and pioneering dissident, whose condemnation had been converted by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"due to the algorithmic analysis of the DNA extracted by Manning and created out of the 30 portraits, how someone could look with these genomic data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also to identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but already openly talked about identification as a woman, was convicted in 2013 for 20 accusations, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"the jail was suppressed, so much so that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-and-white selfie, in which Manning obviously sits on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum-blonde piece - with which she was associated."</seg>
<seg id="2133">"in 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came just out of the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'."</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in this, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts like cigarette butts and chewing gum, extracting the DNA from the trash to produce an image of how these people could look."</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a sort of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press review of the new exhibition. "</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she couldn't be visited at that time and she couldn't be photographed, so you took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"the artist and her incarcerated muse became unequal spectacles, which in the course of two years exchanged several letters."</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created a comic book illustrated by Shoili canungo, which foresaw a future in which the President of Chelsea would convert judgment and she would be able to see the exhibition personally."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy meeting."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump conducts a war against informants from the governmental camp and against transgender troops in order to find new tweetable ways to further inflame the rigid divisions that he should actually fix."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"when Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said that" things happen for a certain reason. ""</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning asked with her excessive signature underneath (the" i "in her family name is endowed with a heart) an end to" automatic fragmentation, based on gender, race, sexuality, and culture. ""</seg>
<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall, her mitochondrial DNA sequence is written - a jack of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific encyclopedia of the artist), how surprisingly similar, at least in biological sense, we are all."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take with them is that our genome will not take care of who we are and how openly genetic data is for an interpretation and how subjectively they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work from 2007, Spurious Memories is also to be seen. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, therefore the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is a page from the above mentioned comic-novel."</seg>
<seg id="2149">"it shows Manning, how it emerges with a free spreader hand in hand from the disciplinary powers of the United States like King Kong."</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they turn your speech, then they have won," "says it."</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so never stop the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter she wrote to me," "said the artist, who greets Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">I still get goosebumps when I talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning hasn't seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it, she will be greeted by the masks in the middle of the room, from her own genomic simulator, which gather like hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"this was also purposeful, like everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5" 2, Manning Stature), where their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past, I had her on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said about the portraits. "</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind its liberation."</seg>
<seg id="2158">University of Northwestern and an employee of Oxford University sought for killing</seg>
<seg id="2159">A nationwide crowd hunting is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University who are looking for suspects after a man was stabbed in a luxury apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries.</seg>
<seg id="2160">"on Monday, Wyndham Lathemi (42) and Andrew Warren (56) were issued arrest warrants due to their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, such as the acts of the Cook County Court."</seg>
<seg id="2161">"the documents say Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches."</seg>
<seg id="2162">A joint warning system published by the police authority of Chicago states that the corpse was discovered on 27 July.</seg>

<seg id="2176">"Guglielmi said it was unclear, whether the incident took place on 27 July."</seg>

<seg id="2266">"therefore, the first three trainings of the UCLA should start at 7: 15 p.m. to meet the already packed schedule of the players."</seg>
<seg id="2267">The compromise away from the two days is more than a day at which the Bruins postponed the start of the camp almost one week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras six seasons carried out practical exercises in Westwood.</seg>
<seg id="2268">They should stop 18 exercises during August. 20 before the formal preparations for their prelude to Texas A & M in September.</seg>

<seg id="2291">"in his younger past, the small Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970's and 1980's."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"but Scotney has lived in Kent 700 years of turbulent history and has now become inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a moped Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents."</seg>

<seg id="2294">What a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"a Castle in England" spans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scotney. each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Steiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg. "</seg>
<seg id="2296">"it is not the first book of Rhodes, based on an archive: he wrote 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpected emotional."</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I just responded to the thumb print on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700's, who worked for the Jacobins," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2298">"this is his thumb print!</seg>
<seg id="2299">"and letters always smell like smoke, because at that time a fire was kindled because of the light."</seg>

<seg id="2302">"for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle (" To be honest, I have overrated my welcome grudge ") this seems to be too beautiful to be true."</seg>
<seg id="2303">"Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian" new "castle, exploring the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted Hydrope pots on the walls and bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch."</seg>
<seg id="2304">"he wandered through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle and talked to landscape patches, gardeners and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book."</seg>
<seg id="2305">"then, at night he drank a whiskey and started writing."</seg>
<seg id="2306">"the intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown since the National Trust won the full access until 2006, when the last Erbin, Elizabeth Hussey, died."</seg>
<seg id="2307">"when Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just started to take care of the archive, which he described as" hundreds of years, in which aristocrats said, "Oh, throw it on the attic." "</seg>

<seg id="2310">"some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive on a broader base into English history, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381."</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of an uproar appearing in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," "Rhodes says."</seg>
<seg id="2312">The peasant uprising began in this area and I thought that an uprising was a good start.</seg>
<seg id="2313">Perhaps the two are interconnected? "</seg>
<seg id="2314">"other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit patter, which the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation."</seg>
<seg id="2315">"or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell was portrayed in the 18th century, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was made years later when his coffin was excavated)."</seg>

<seg id="2348">"more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged links to the movement of the exile-preacher Fethullah Gülen, who sees Erdogan as the wirettor of the coup attempt."</seg>
<seg id="2349">"against 486 people, who have been directly involved in the attempted coup, will be dealt with in Ankara following this week."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"already on the day after the coup, Erdoğan had called the coup attempt as a" "God's gift" "as he gave him the opportunity to completely clean the armed forces."</seg>
<seg id="2351">But does Erdogan really have a grip on the army?</seg>
<seg id="2352">"at the end of February, the newspaper" Hürriyet "published an article entitled" Uncomfortable in the Military Headquarters. ""</seg>
<seg id="2353">"on the general staff, there are concerns about increasing" Islamization "of the army, which, among other things, manifests itself in the lifting of the headscarring ban on female soldiers, wrote the newspaper."</seg>
<seg id="2354">"at any rate, the large-scale model in the army and the security forces continues."</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in mid-July, by decree, Erdogan made further 7395 government servants, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers."</seg>
<seg id="2356">It seemed that Erdogan has tamed the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">The generals used to pass earlier than the actual masters of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2358">Three times they putted their role as guardian of the secular state order.</seg>
<seg id="2359">"following his election victory in 2002, Erdoğan pressed the power of the military in step by step, not least by calling on the European Union's reforms."</seg>
<seg id="2360">Former officers say that Erdogan is specifically driving an Islamization of the armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="2361">"in the magazine" Vocal Europe, "a name-by-name officer, who was seeking asylum after the attempted coup d" état against persecution abroad, would be the Turkish army in a few years "full of extremists and salafists." "</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried</seg>
<seg id="2389">"just as you thought it could not become even more crazy in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"yes, indeed."</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are at the moment a big deal.</seg>
<seg id="2392">"recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots within the next five to ten years."</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must start taking their ascension seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye colour of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make fun of them, but the businesses deliver a lot of it, and we will see them much more often," "said Mr Sharkey in the publication of his new report."</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can also" "adapt" "his robot according to his beliefs and choose everything from the eye colour of the robot over the shape of the nipples to the type or colour of his fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but it becomes even more unsettling, as many robots have the" personalities "that a stonford-woman would look progressive."</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex dolls have evolved to robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the RealBotix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the characteristics they find appealing, such as shyness."</seg>
<seg id="2401">"and then there is the Roxxxy gold sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed characters like" Frigid Farrah, "which gives the impression of shyness and" Wild Wendy "with an" adventurous "personality."</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as well as possible," "heats the True Companion website."</seg>
<seg id="2403">"so she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day she also has her moods - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"she can be tired, be fixed on conversation or she can be" "in mood" "!"</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace genuine human relationships - but the submissive female features, the allusions to rape if you take a step towards Frigid (means: reluctant) Farrah, alarm one the most."</seg>
<seg id="2407">"true Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator on its website, but for men."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then not have Roxxxy?"</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just just another sex toy."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"their formation and increasing sophistication point to slightly darker and deeper into our culture, towards a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional addition."</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men will of course not hold any sex robots, and while the FRR records their increasing popularity, they remain on the verge of consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what leaks out of the boundary zones can be very instructive with regard to the spirit of time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not odd or insulting until the free market gives them permission to do so.</seg>
<seg id="2414">"there is, however, a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots are emerging in a time where women's rights are threatened globally in which there is a president in the White House who has boasted to have women sexually assaulted."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"the most deterrent aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The maid's report ') are not the graphic images, the devoured body and the exposed eyes, but how realistic this vision works."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment this does not feel like a big jump."</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as technically possible (albeit with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Your builders want them to feel human to imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, when it comes to their" personalities, "the robots are not real women."</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companions or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"they have no mediation or background history, nothing that hinders independence or anything that could disturb the fantasy of total submission."</seg>
<seg id="2422">"in other words, they are pleasing slaves."</seg>

<seg id="2424">Is Trumps great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of healthy human mind</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a truism of the Trump-era that the political divisions that polarized the US electorate have also divided families in small-format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">"around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers in the USA with advice about how to deal with the horror of Trump's selectable relatives."</seg>

<seg id="2430">"I mention this because my cousin, a left-handed poet who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York."</seg>
<seg id="2431">It reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">"with Trump in the White House, anyone whom she knows, including the republican kinship with which she had fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and very strange on the same side."</seg>
<seg id="2433">"for the dining table this is certainly a good thing, but it is in a further context that this also brings significant risks."</seg>
<seg id="2434">"the left was strengthened by Trump, but the resultant effect of his presidency has the power to push all of us to the right."</seg>
<seg id="2435">"when we speak of" "normalization" "and Trump, we refer to the gruesome possibility that one day his kittens won't repel us any more."</seg>
<seg id="2436">"there is, however, an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump Republicans normalize the right wing, who suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness in comparison to his standards."</seg>
<seg id="2437">"today I find myself falling away from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's urcomical version of the madman - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked) - both compared to Trump in fact seem to be one of very mild offences."</seg>
<seg id="2438">"when Trump dies, the next candidate of the Republicans must be mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement."</seg>
<seg id="2439">"when my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the biggest carousel of the New York Parks, and the best three dollars to spend in the city if you don't need any caffeine."</seg>

<seg id="2492">Do diesel drivers have to take part in the promotion?</seg>
<seg id="2493">The most important questions and answers at a glance.</seg>
<seg id="2494">"at the diesel summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars."</seg>
<seg id="2495">The aim is to improve the emission characteristics of cars in the emission classes Euro 5 and in part Euro 6.</seg>
<seg id="2496">Euro-4-Diesel or worse are excluded from this.</seg>
<seg id="2497">Anja Smeteanin of the ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments:</seg>
<seg id="2498">Is the new promotion mandatory?</seg>
<seg id="2499">"no, the software updates are voluntary."</seg>
<seg id="2500">"the mandatory updates have only been valid for the vehicles that have Schumann software," says Anja Smetanine. "</seg>
<seg id="2501">The retrofitting has ordered the Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt (KBA).</seg>
<seg id="2502">How and when will customers be informed about updates?</seg>

<seg id="2504">Daimler announces to enroll every person affected.</seg>
<seg id="2505">"if an inspection is due anyway, it will be done within its frame."</seg>
<seg id="2506">How long should the conversions take place altogether?</seg>
<seg id="2507">"hard to say," says Smeteanin. "</seg>
<seg id="2508">This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"because we have seen, the automobile manufacturers do not act voluntarily at the environmental issue so far."</seg>
<seg id="2510">How long should the update last?</seg>
<seg id="2511">The retrofitting itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Time-consuming can be to get an appointment.</seg>

<seg id="2540">"at the same time, it amazes that no application fulfils the requirement profile so far."</seg>

<seg id="2542">"under consideration of the regular periods of notice, it should still be enough time for a revision."</seg>
<seg id="2543">"since Haslach is acting as a lower building law office for the administration community, applicants must present corresponding conclusions."</seg>
<seg id="2544">Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">"if it would no longer be able to fill it out, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice."</seg>

<seg id="2578">Insulators and masts were also damaged.</seg>
<seg id="2579">"red meat, dairy products and chocolate might help to relieve IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)"</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">"but a new study claims the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2582">"incurable condition affecting approximately 1.3 million and 300,000 in the United States causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, loss of weight, and extreme tiredness."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"while the affected person is usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers found at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tryptophan helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, stated that immune cells are patrolling in the intestine to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in the food do not penetrate the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">"cells capable of triggering inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body, without damaging the tissues."</seg>
<seg id="2586">"if the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments have been discovered that a kind of tolerance-promoting immune cell occurs in mice carrying a certain bacterium in its intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance. "</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had from these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet tolerant of tryptophan encourages more tolerant, less inflammatory intestinal epithelia if the same system is also employed in humans."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the Postdoctoral student, Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan, investigated a type of immune cell supporting the tolerance when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was separated but not."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"it assumed that the difference with the intestinal microbiome of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the mice's intestines were sequenced and there were found six bacterial species present in the mice with the immune cells, but without it infecting them in mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"mice were taken up in a sterile environment, so that an intestinal microbiome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. Cross and the immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"in order to understand how the bacteria were working on the immune system, the researchers allowed L. reuteri to grow in a liquid and then surpassed small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells, isolated from the mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"when the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, known as indol-3 lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"if the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mice's food, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but if tryptophan was halved, the number of cells decreased by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that people have the same tolerant cells as mice and that most of us protect L. Cross in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said," "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine."</seg>
<seg id="2603">"potentially, high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an extension of this population."</seg>

<seg id="2606">"the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea began with a 2: 1 win in Dublin, the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday, and impressed in the keeper's role as people as Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched at will."</seg>

<seg id="2623">"as the wind turns: when Sigmar Gabriel was still the SPD boss, S & D prime ministers blew before elections with a certain concern to Berlin."</seg>
<seg id="2624">"only a fire from the party centre, but not a headwind from the Bund, was the most important desire of the ballots."</seg>
<seg id="2625">"since Martin Schulz leads the party, this has changed fundamentally."</seg>
<seg id="2626">"since then, the employees from the Willy-Brandt-Haus are watching events in the SPD-governed provincial capitals with growing horror."</seg>
<seg id="2627">What Martin Schulz got from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in the approach with headwinds.</seg>
<seg id="2628">There were gravings.</seg>
<seg id="2629">And one after the other.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"according to the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the Federal-CDU sees a general signal against the coalition of SPD and Greens."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"this once more shows: red-green can simply not be reliably ruled out," "said CDU Secretary General Peter Tauber, Germany's editorial network (RND)."</seg>
<seg id="2632">The surprising fraction of a Green party has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.</seg>
<seg id="2633">"five months before the Parliament elections, his red-green coalition lost its one-voice majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP."</seg>
<seg id="2634">The Green German Managing Director Michael Kellner has called upon the backsliding Lower Saxony Greens Euro MP Elke Tests to give back their mandate.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The transition to the CDU means a clear falsification of the electorate's will.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"Elke Tests must immediately return her mandate," said the Federal Executive Officer and election campaign leader of the Greens to the German editorial network (RND). "</seg>
<seg id="2637">"this must not be true," a SPD campaign militarily groans when the new hidemic message reaches the party centre on Friday afternoon. "</seg>
<seg id="2638">"Stephan Weil, the SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, is on the verge of the green deputies of Alsace to CDU without own government majority."</seg>
<seg id="2639">It is the provisional highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD state associations.</seg>
<seg id="2640">And no one knows what comes next.</seg>
<seg id="2641">The misery began with the unexpectedly clear defeat at the Saarland election in March.</seg>
<seg id="2642">"a blue eye, no more, reassuring the comrades at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2643">"after the legislative elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different."</seg>
<seg id="2644">"this became, and indeed, everything was much worse."</seg>
<seg id="2645">"the defeat in Kiel caused the SPD to wobble, the Dusseldorf-Pleite beat the party smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="2646">The comrades in the weeks after that laboriously raced again.</seg>
<seg id="2647">"then, when they had just shot new courage, the G-20 summit from Hamburg came."</seg>
<seg id="2648">And with him came the next depression.</seg>
<seg id="2649">"mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD leader, lost his Nimbus in that weekend, because he was sitting in the Elbphilharmonie while his city was burning."</seg>
<seg id="2650">And because he did so much wrong in the crisis communication afterwards what you can do wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2651">"since then, Scholz fights for its political survival."</seg>
<seg id="2652">So now Stephan Weil.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"because of the VW-Exhaust and its role in the Supervisory Board, the Lower Saxony Prime Minister has been in criticism for some time now."</seg>
<seg id="2654">Some survey values came to an end.</seg>
<seg id="2655">"nevertheless, or perhaps precisely because, in recent weeks, Weil tried to set accents in the Bund."</seg>
<seg id="2656">"the ambition of the former mayor of Hannover, to expand his power in Berlin, did not remain hidden in the surroundings of Martin Schulz."</seg>
<seg id="2657">"they let him go, as they promised themselves a stabilization of the party."</seg>
<seg id="2658">Now the exact opposite could occur.</seg>
<seg id="2659">"in doing so, Weil fails to blame the party-internal coercion of the Lower Saxony Greens."</seg>
<seg id="2660">And Schulz did not know.</seg>
<seg id="2661">"at times, comrades endeavour to keep their own ranks closed."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"their anger is directed towards the Greens, and here especially to the backsliding parliamentarists of Tests."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"it is unbearable and democratic, as Mrs. Tests puts her own career eating over the interests of everyone else," says Matthias Miersch, head of the party left in the SPD Parliamentary Group, the editorial network Germany (RND). "</seg>
<seg id="2664">"Mrs. Tests has not been elected to parliament because of her person as a direct candidate, but has been elected to parliament on the country list of the Lower Saxony Greens."</seg>
<seg id="2665">The logical consequence would be that it returns its mandate.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"Thomas Oppermann, chief of the SPD Parliamentary Group, complains of an" undemocratic maneuver. ""</seg>
<seg id="2667">"the voter wille four years ago was clear: people made Stephan Weil the prime minister," says Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as a leading candidate in the parliamentary elections, the RND. "</seg>
<seg id="2668">"now the personal career of a future CDU deputies falsifies the election result," "said Oppermann."</seg>

<seg id="2715">"the White House's decision to fly a navy helicopter to the South Lawn event for an event that highlights American production last month costs taxpayers according to the military that has been left to the TIME magazine, up to 24,000 US dollars."</seg>
<seg id="2716">"the green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs."</seg>
<seg id="2717">"President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House, made a tour of products from all 50 states."</seg>
<seg id="2718">"the Connecticut helicopter was issued alongside a yacht from Maine, a fighter car from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi."</seg>
<seg id="2719">"the White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or Frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operation of the helicopter."</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event to his superiors, the deputy Navy Commander for Aviation. "</seg>
<seg id="2721">"the message showed that on July 17th the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn for the event at 3 p.m., and so long remained until the turf was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00 on this evening."</seg>
<seg id="2722">"the note adds that if the departure from the White House was delayed, a second crew would be required for the return flight due to the limitation of the service hours."</seg>
<seg id="2723">"the original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, while the safety personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the plane."</seg>
<seg id="2724">"from the records provided by TIME, it was not clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required."</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees to use state property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Records indicate that HMX-1 has asked if the event could violate the determination.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch acts and we were informed that this was not the case," "the commander wrote."</seg>
<seg id="2728">"sounds like you are locked," answered the deputy commander. "</seg>
<seg id="2729">The event "Made in America" was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.</seg>
<seg id="2730">But even official events have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="2731">"at the event, the President gave an impetus to reform the health reform that was going on in the Senate and he propagated efforts to curb government regulations."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"the use of the airplane, known as Marine One or Air Force One, is hardly a new phenomenon from politically advantageous conditions."</seg>
<seg id="2733">Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey.</seg>
<seg id="2734">"but to claim their use only for a photo op, is unusual."</seg>
<seg id="2735">"Trump conducted an investigation in February when the presidential plane was in front of the background of his first campaign rallye in Melbourne, Florida, taxi services, and his Twitter account is full of news complaining about the use of the presidential plane through its predecessor."</seg>
<seg id="2736">"the White House is enthusiastic about the show" "Made In America" "- the products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials," "said the deputy secretary of the White House, Lindsay Walters."</seg>
<seg id="2737">"HMX-1 crews often perform training flights in the Washington area and South Lawn area, in order to offset the US president in the White House with precise centimetres."</seg>
<seg id="2738">"when Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 performed 58 practice landings in the White House."</seg>
<seg id="2739">"the flight for the" "Made in America" "event counted for the training requirements of the flight crew for the month, said a civil servant."</seg>
<seg id="2740">"helicopters units also flew 11 hours on this day for" "non-presidential support missions". ""</seg>
<seg id="2741">The White House said the taxpayers accepted the burden for none of the other props presented at the event.</seg>
<seg id="2742">A spokesman of Sikorsky said the company was not involved in putting the helicopter on the South Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="2743">"HMX-1 does not have budget recordings for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event."</seg>
<seg id="2744">"according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the 2017 budget, the DoD refunds rate for the VH-3D is 24.380 USD per hour."</seg>
<seg id="2745">Records of the unit list the flight time of the plane as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="2746">The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "the cost of taxpayers on the basis of estimates for refunds is highly misleading," "said Walters."</seg>
<seg id="2748">"these estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual budget."</seg>
<seg id="2749">"according to a RAND study from 2015, DoD refunds do not include personnel costs, but take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and contract completion."</seg>
<seg id="2750">"at that time, the former press spokesman of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event."</seg>
<seg id="2751">"the idea is to present things that are produced in America this week," Spicer said. "</seg>
<seg id="2752">"and I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds if not even thousands of people depend on it."</seg>
<seg id="2753">And I think most Americans are all proud of the helicopters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.</seg>
<seg id="2754">"of course, it is appropriate to emphasize this."</seg>
<seg id="2755">"it was not clear if Trump interacted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver's seat of a fire engine car."</seg>

<seg id="2893">It would greatly serve the prestige of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret about their own omissions or their then false assessment of the events.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"the Vatican newspaper" Osservatore Romano "on the other hand, on the other hand, criticised that in reporting on violence in the cathedral-cats," two measures "were measured."</seg>
<seg id="2895">"in regard to the encroachments in Regensburg no one doubts that it is a matter of" shameful and shameful acts, "which would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the author Lucetta Scarafia, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics committee."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit of calling the Catholic Church as the source of all evils is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep it for normal," writes Scarafia. "</seg>
<seg id="2897">"Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis also said in the interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk:" "we are happy to go to the church and that is a frozen food."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"she also pointed out that in her youth" "blows a quite normal educational tool" "had been" "to be done with cheeky children, as I was one."</seg>
<seg id="2899">"it is unfair to apply today's standards for earlier decades, as the world has changed."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"in connection with reports of the misuse cases, pope brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"completely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who authored the memorabilia" "My brother of the Pope" "with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take protection from Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "for all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report. "</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is written in the 440-page report submitted by the diocese Regensburg with the clarification of attorney Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"in total, 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the early 1990s" with high plausibility "victims of assaults."</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report it is named Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994:" to sum up, it can be said that by R. in many cases, forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied. "</seg>
<seg id="2906">"especially in the case of high emotionality, punishment could also be more severe for the students."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"nevertheless, in contrast to numerous other defendants, many victims underestimated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, can even combine positive memories with him despite violence."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger was relieved of his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" incidents of violence on protective grounds at the Regensburger Domspatzen, "gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2910">"for one, many students emphasize his" humanity. ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"on the other hand, he also appears as a choleric and perfectionist, who became tangible when a Domspatz produced no top performance musically."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Heseman: if you take the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back, one has to ask oneself rather, which is why the name Georg Ratzinger appears in it at all."</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is dedicated to eight pages and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or co-knowing in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses of violence at the preparatory school also took place outside of its sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">"at best, one can reproach him of having experienced it too late or not having taken the first references seriously enough."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the Domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was perceived as literally -" redemption, "" heaven "and" better world. ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"so also the broad majority of his students Georg Ratzinger provides a very excellent testimony, describes him as" warm-hearted, "" sincere, "" competent "and" understanding, "as extremely good-natured teacher who regularly supplied the guys with cakes, biscuits and candies and" always moved by grapes from children. ""</seg>
<seg id="2919">"only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which also led to breakthroughs."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"that he did not only knit up with chairs and cast the keys on the ground, but also gave ear and ears to the hair or ears, he has already admitted years ago, deeply regrets and apologized for it."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"to his salvation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the initial period, the 1960s and 1970s, with parents as well as with teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think every one of us who was born before 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I also experienced this in a secular school, a state gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what is actually going on in this report, namely the horrible sexual abuse and abuse of violence at the pre-school, the dreadels are admittedly."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"one wonders if it is not more likely to do with his familiarity and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media just fell on him."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"at the Bavarian pope, many who have never understood him are still working diligently."</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report is relieved by Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in the media, in connection with the report a lot was reported about the issue of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger cast any involvement or co-knowing in terms of sexual abuse in the final report?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: no. no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of 67 victims of sexual assaults claimed to be entrusted with the Cathedral master.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were dedicated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I have never dared to talk to my father or mother about it," "said a person affected," "It was all very embarrassing for me."</seg>
<seg id="2935">"the real problem in the investigation of sexual abuse, however, is that most victims are silent."</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they did not even confide in parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir director, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators professionally."</seg>
<seg id="2937">What is the rate of the Domspatzen students Ratzinger's role with regard to the abuse of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student put it this way: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... not a case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely insights and could have stopped the perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I consider it... also for really absurd to assume that reckoned to him... to have opened up more urgently or more clearly or rather than to their parents, dormitory leaders, trust teachers, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one talks to him about sex... - unthinkable.</seg>
<seg id="2941">"in this way, the report concludes with a clear result:" that the students and / or their environment affected him in the run-up could not be confirmed as part of the study. "</seg>
<seg id="2942">"as far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is therefore acquitted of any blackjack."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"in this way, he cannot be accused of not having prevented him or brought him to an advertisement."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore, there is no reason to link up to his good name with these disguised crimes, as it happened in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">Much of "violent excesses" in the media was to be read at the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2946">"the former master master Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "omitting" "in the report."</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this reproach?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem that everything was mixed up and mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, right in the middle, Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">But precisely this is again an abuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"there is a clean separation: between the pre-school and the gymnasium of the cathedral-cats, between sexual abuse and violence and, let us say, other reproaches."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report covers incidents from the time since 1945, thus also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not choir director of the Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"all the terrible test pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers had been victimized and painstakingly suffered, all took place at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen where really scandalous conditions have to be ruled out."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with them, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he only got the boys to face when they were already at the gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on this was, like most witnesses, emphasizing the subject of" Vorschule "taboo."</seg>
<seg id="2955">You were only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradise" conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the school gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but there was no sadistic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" many victims appreciate the general humanity of R., and therefore in many cases even have positive memories of him in spite of violence. ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">At most the reproach remains to have looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">"but despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre-school."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71 when he just started to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible, (so the witness) didn't want to hear anything, and then again around 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger consistently bridle the ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral gymnasium that the report even reproduced."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this, he points out that" in the preparatory school, the death penalty will continue to be practised. ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">"in view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"this was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, as test penalties, even in Bavaria, had long been banned."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before that, they occurred in a legal grey area, as each of us is still aware of."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"it was hard to estimate for him, where the persons concerned were perhaps exaggerated or dramatized, and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say he has always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That's just not right.</seg>
<seg id="2971">"only in 1980, the death penalty for schools was officially abolished in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis claimed it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we historians are talking about the" pitfall of anachronism, "i.e. the danger of evaluating past moral standards."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess is right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"of course, this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was detracted at all times, and not for what happened in the pre-school of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, which goes far beyond that at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2977">It's all horrible and I'm glad that it will finally be reworked.</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time I have to take protection from Georg Ratzinger, for all this had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"in the 1970s, his means of disciplining and punishing the ears and ears of hair and ears were widespread in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"when physical punishment was then forbidden, he was strictly adhered to it."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"in the conversations with you for the book" "My Brother of the Pope", "Georg Ratzinger described what picture of his time at the Regensburger time?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject matter test also become a language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, i.e. Pope Benedikts XVI., tells us from his perspective, as the Domspatzen played only a secondary role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I did not deny that he had a strict regiment there."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but this must be said once: without this perfectionism, without demanding discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world trangs from the hitherto rather nationally known Regensburger Domspatzen, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and candies alone, the rebellious boys don't even make a big singer and stand before any success, regardless of the area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming."</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of person did you experience with Georg Ratzinger in conversations with her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through work on the book and beyond, I have met Georg Ratzinger very well and again and again experienced as wonderful, humorous, basic-loving, deeply believing and savoury people, of whom you can't imagine that he could do anything in a fly."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I get regular contact with how many former Domspatzen still today, 23 years after his execution, regularly keep contact with him, visit him, read him - he's almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who do not forgive him until today, that he once was stern to them, are therefore clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the Domspatzen are grateful to him for enriching their lives and bringing them closer to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he is always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovable respect for her, to which she is still looking at and whom she adores."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once again, clearly: everything that is proposed to him are educational methods which were on the order of the day at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have long since overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is extremely unjust, a man, just because he is prominently and has an even more prominent brother to make a medial scapegoat."</seg>
<seg id="2996">The evil intent behind it is only too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for the report, which was just published, relieves him."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the estate would command, a 93-year-old man who acquired great merits and without the outside Bavaria and perhaps even Germany, nobody would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace."</seg>
