28 @-@ year @-@ old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the staircase of a local grocery store .
&quot; the brother of the victim said he could not imagine anyone who would hurt him , &quot; Fin@@ ally , it went up with him again . &quot;
&quot; the body , found on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field Mall , was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gali@@ cia from San Francisco , divided the geri@@ atric department in San Francisco . &quot;
the San Francisco Police Department claimed that death was clas@@ sed as murder and the investigation was underway .
&quot; the brother of the victim , Louis Gali@@ cia , told the ABS station K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who previously worked as a cook in Boston , had captured his dream job as a cook at the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters Restaurant in San Francisco six months ago . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ man for the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said that they &quot; &quot; shocked &quot; &quot; about his death and were destroyed on the ground . &quot;
&quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot;
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are at this difficult time with Fran@@ ks family and friends .
&quot; Louis Gali@@ cia said that Frank was initially living in host@@ els , but that &quot; things for him finally went up . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he found an apartment , he had a friend , &quot; said Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot;
Louis Gali@@ cia said he could not imagine anyone wanting to hurt his younger brother .
he was a friendly person with a big heart .
&quot; connecting his family with his family was to always cook us something , prepare for dinner , &quot; said Louis Gali@@ cia . &quot;
he never wanted to participate in any kind of confrontation .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the river .
&quot; in everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond , which sh@@ one brigh@@ tly every day , &quot; he said . &quot;
anyone who has information about the case will be asked to call the message phone of the SF@@ PD under the number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put in drawers
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston does not always have to be perfect or successful .
this has made the Hollywood star un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally clear in an interview .
&quot; I always get stuck in drawers or get stuck from the outside label , which usually have little to do with me and the reality . &quot;
I don &apos;t have the desire to always be perfect and successful .
&quot; frank@@ ly , these things are rather sni@@ ff@@ ing me . &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about it as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current &quot; Cos@@ m@@ opolitan . &quot;
&quot; the act@@ ress likes to spend her time at home , in front of TV with lo@@ cker@@ em D@@ utt and Mexican food , it is said in the magazine . &quot;
&quot; she brings the question of the desire for a child : &quot; &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; says the Hollywood star . &quot;
&quot; in her new movie &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a breeze , &quot; Ani@@ ston is seen as a single mother of two sons . &quot;
the film runs from August 25th .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the pyramid of sports
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger looked for a bit di@@ version with some colleagues with a ride on the beach .
it was a premiere for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sport pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a few minutes , the horses remembered their holidays , they hun@@ ted at the fast gal@@ lo@@ p home to the feed @-@ t@@ rou@@ ghs . &quot;
&quot; one kilometer at this pace , I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger . &quot;
and so the riding career then ended again .
&quot; on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fers of all time - 101 tournament victories - were again close to horses . &quot;
&quot; he let his family pass through the plant of the AL@@ RV , and on a horse he didn &apos;t even s@@ nat@@ ch himself for photo purposes . &quot;
long was the first time in Aachen and thus also with the CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports aid handed over to the man from An@@ hausen in the frame of a small gala the golden sport pyramid .
there is no lack of awards for the symp@@ athetic sports@@ man .
&quot; Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silver lau@@ rel leaf , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ... &quot;
even the British Queen had already bl@@ amed him .
long is the 18th pri@@ z@@ ew@@ inner of the pyramid of sports .
&quot; in Aachen , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; because she is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment . &quot;
&quot; for decades , Lan@@ ger has been promoting the offspring . &quot;
&quot; and so he also gave the 25,000 Euro prize . &quot;
&quot; with 15 other outstanding sports@@ men , the two @-@ fold US master si@@ eger was admitted to the Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the real Corn@@ elia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , der Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the rider Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ bir@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ ously the Hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich . &quot;
many of these sports@@ men came to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company moved to the Spring@@ sta@@ dion , where the Lav@@ azza price went . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept the distance from the big animals .
Clinton &apos;s and Tru@@ mp@@ s Economic Policy Com@@ par@@ ison : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent trade agreements T@@ TP - both Clinton and Tru@@ mp want to prevent this .
&quot; however , the two US presidential candidates are in favour of tax and energy policy , as well as in a fundamental issue . &quot;
&quot; the difference in economic policy between Donald Tru@@ mp and H@@ illary Clinton is a fundamental , rather philosophical difference . &quot;
on the role of the state .
&quot; in doubt , Tru@@ mp wants to keep it small and cau@@ tions how the state of the economy can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations . &quot;
&quot; Clinton would like to tax the economy and regulate it to death , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , says Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; he will make a massive return on regulations , and he is heavily involved in a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for companies . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , said : &quot; the state has certain tasks to fulfil , it has to open up dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money for it . &quot;
&quot; that is why taxes would be increased for the rich , they say . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in the need to invest , Tru@@ mp and Clinton are almost silent . &quot;
the democratic candidate leaves the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical shut@@ ters of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
so on Tru@@ mp we could still cross @-@ party discussions .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
Tru@@ mp wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and to re @-@ launch coal mining in the US .
&quot; oil extraction is also to be possible in so far protected areas , the Paris Climate Protection Agreement is intended to cancel . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , wants to explicitly expand renewable energies and demand : &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be . &quot;
&quot; but not only in infrastructure , but also in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other . &quot;
&quot; T@@ PP , the transp@@ azi@@ fic trade agreement , do not want to sign both . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both would not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - but simply better protect American jobs . &quot;
&quot; they should also be better paid , for instance , Clinton calls for . &quot;
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a hunger strike .
it wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; what Tru@@ mp wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must rush , then he says he must not be changed . &quot;
but the great discussion of the coming months would probably be more likely to develop the fiscal policy of the two camps .
&quot; on the one hand , Tru@@ mp who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens wants to boost growth . &quot;
&quot; his critics respect him , so the budget deficit would only be greater . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton , who wants at least from the rich wants to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are also not the solution . &quot;
escape : &quot; every fled woman has experience with sexual violence &quot;
&quot; sexual violence belongs to women who are fle@@ eing alone , almost everyday . &quot;
&quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed . &quot;
a house offers refuge .
four women sit in a large kitchen .
each one has a baby that is at most one year old .
one has put her little son into his arms .
he looks curi@@ ously into the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es at the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is observed .
she sm@@ iles and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene looks normal .
talking to Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; she is the Managing Director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a sponsor of social services in Bavaria , and is among other things dealing with the topic of women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are refugees .
&quot; in the north of Munich , they live in one of the few de@@ centralized accommodation for single @-@ die women and their children in Bavaria . &quot;
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs created the institution together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Frau@@ enh@@ ilfe .
recently it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men are not there - also not as visitors .
the exception is a guard at the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has had experiences with sexual violence on her escape , &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars because they are persecuted political because they thre@@ aten torture or death , or because their families send them to Europe as hope bear@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; women out@@ weigh other reasons for their escape : &quot; &quot; many steal away secretly , because they see no other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their homeland , they have had experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , honour kill@@ ings , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
this is what drives them away .
&quot; on the flight , it goes on . &quot;
&quot; for example , that tu@@ gs are demanding a sexual act for a bottle of water , &quot; B@@ ahr says . &quot;
&quot; and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families . &quot;
&quot; who think that the end , as soon as they arrive in Germany , are ir@@ re , nar@@ rates B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; even here , single women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be considered inferior and ab@@ used in the worst case . &quot;
&quot; this leads to the fact that about 90 per cent of women living in the housing in the north of Munich are trau@@ mati@@ zed , she estimates . &quot;
&quot; some of the children are certainly not born voluntarily . &quot;
many women are accustomed to say nothing .
&quot; or they don &apos;t dare to talk openly about the experience , because the shame is too big . &quot;
&quot; since they often don &apos;t know how to help , I need more accommodations just for them , requires B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees . &quot;
&quot; on the question of whether they knew from a similar project as in Munich in their area of competence , some answers with no . &quot;
&quot; in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia , there is no such thing in the housing of the governments . &quot;
&quot; even in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , fled women are not housed separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Middle Fran@@ con@@ ia there are floors or own houses only for single women and their children in some community establishments . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two main accommodations exclusively for women . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Women &apos;s Rights and Gender Equality &quot; &quot; committee in the European Parliament also calls for women to be placed separately by men . &quot;
&quot; in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women are accommodated separately . &quot;
&quot; if the privacy is missing or will men and women be accommodated together , there can be - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot;
&quot; especially the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women , is available in the study . &quot;
&quot; how much the women feel this need of protection can be read on the rush , which is to be found on the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since we &apos;ve talked about it , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
you could easily make a second home .
assistance doctors argue : demands for new employment campaigns
assistant doctors have called their union to appro@@ ve new employment campaigns in their disputes with regard to a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has called for its entire council to appro@@ ve more work campaigns since the beginning of September .
J@@ DC said that it would have been given ministers to respond to concerns about the contract .
&quot; in July , assistant doctors and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BM@@ A . &quot;
&quot; he was rejected by 58 % of his members , who voted in the elections . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the members who was published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government &quot; per@@ si@@ sted calm@@ ly &quot; to problems , resulting in the agreement being rejected . &quot;
&quot; she said : &quot; &quot; considering this , the J@@ DC Board agreed to completely reject the proposed new treaty and requested official new negotiations on all your concerns . &quot;
&quot; in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board today issued a formal request for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to appro@@ ve a running programme of escal@@ ating work combat activities that began in early September . &quot;
&quot; the disputes led to the fact that assistants of this year were quar@@ r@@ elling six times , the first overall failures in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
the head of the BM@@ A resident Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana retired after the election to reject the agreed contractual conditions recommended by the BM@@ A .
&quot; he divided BM@@ A members during the meetings , which took place before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 Assistant Doc@@ tors and Medical students that the contract should be beneficial and accepted . &quot;
&quot; after the vote , the Minister for Health , Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t , said that the contract for doctors in England would be compulsory . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give themselves hands and to announce an official end of the eight month long war of words and economic sanctions .
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gil@@ ded hall of St. Petersburg Palace , I can not resist the impression that Ankara will most want this reconciliation . &quot;
&quot; there was the hand@@ shake , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin &apos;s smile seemed sav@@ alli@@ zed , and he barely radi@@ ated warmth , even for his restra@@ ined circumstances . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , spoke repeatedly of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
&quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve . &quot;
&quot; the next day , a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan has beha@@ ved as if nothing bad happened . &quot;
&quot; to me , his enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite . &quot;
&quot; but one of Putin &apos;s brilliant , sustainable cows showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had forgotten nothing . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words : the shot of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s response to the time was kind@@ led .
Putin split and accused Ankara of having fallen into the back of Russia .
the crime was even greater as it was committed by a supposed friend .
to rebuild the un@@ cle becomes difficult if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months , the controlled media controlled a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
suddenly it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything .
&quot; most serious , the accus@@ ations of senior officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family benefited from illegal oil trading in Syria &apos;s Syria , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he has v@@ ehem@@ ently denied this .
&quot; but in St. Petersburg , the official message was that it was time to look ahead . &quot;
&quot; after all , this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse that he wanted to hear from the President Erdo@@ gan . &quot;
Russia could book a kind of victory .
the advantages of a ce@@ ase@@ fire are clear to Ankara on the hand .
&quot; in the first place , Erdo@@ gan needs all the friends he can get after he has been reli@@ eved for almost his ministry during a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat . &quot;
repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also sha@@ ken him .
but there are also economic motives .
&quot; Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year . &quot;
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when flights are resum@@ ed . &quot;
they count on a late @-@ seasonal rush to the Mediterranean .
&quot; this week , the state television endor@@ sed cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti expressed it as follows : &quot; tourists there , tomatoes long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious at the West because it considers its reaction to the attempted power grab as a weak response .
&quot; in addition , the ongoing res@@ ent@@ ment about the sn@@ ail tempo of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is keen to benefit from the cool atmosphere and to reduce Turkey &apos;s relationship to the West . &quot;
&quot; in Ankara , the Russian head of state gained a bonus that after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat he demanded support for the chosen state organs . &quot;
&quot; this is a matter of course for Moscow , which itself has a deep fear of regime change . &quot;
&quot; the summit in this brilliant palace at the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey to portra@@ y an &quot; &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; : two countries that viol@@ ate the West and feel bad and now f@@ ading . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently played a role as a peac@@ em@@ aker , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides . &quot;
&quot; it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents said at the press conference that they had not even stri@@ pped the topic . &quot;
&quot; Turkey &apos;s president deliberately avoided a question of their differences , while Putin decided to emphasize this . &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in the face of the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey shot down the Russian fighting jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State speak at least once again . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland is no longer available to customers outside Scotland
&quot; according to the Bank &apos;s Executive Board , R@@ BS should only be reduced to a back office role . &quot;
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
&quot; by Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan , BBC Scotland said that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; since then , the Bank has dist@@ anced itself from collap@@ sing and rescu@@ ing nearly eight years ago . &quot;
&quot; during this time , brand strate@@ gi@@ cs &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other end @-@ consumer brands . &quot;
&quot; she supported international sport with millions of pounds at sponsor@@ ing , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don W@@ inner Andy Mur@@ ray . &quot;
but now she has decided to put more national brands into focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will be available only for clients in Scotland but will not be initi@@ alized .
&quot; in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , de@@ centralised headquarters and stock quotes are to be changed to Nat@@ west . &quot;
the brand Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are other smaller brands for the retail banking , which will be more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dru@@ m@@ mond und Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a viewing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the brand RS@@ B becomes our investment brand and the brand under which our employees will be employed , as we now become more a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; when the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand . &quot;
&quot; I say now that we do not pursue global goals , but local targets . &quot;
each of these brands will stand in their own congregations for something completely different and our employees will work among these brands with the customers .
R@@ BS has already stated that it will not be able to continue its Six Nations Sponsor@@ ing and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in its sport sponsor@@ ing .
&quot; it is time for us to develop into the bank of brands , because how do we focus inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the Chairman of the Executive Board . &quot;
&quot; it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago , if we said that we would be a great bank for our customers and have launched these brands . &quot;
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see a lot of changes . &quot;
&quot; we can launch these brands again , so I think the time has come . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reaches its 3.@@ 000@@ th gain at New@@ market on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
&quot; D@@ ett@@ ori spra@@ ys champagne after a double at New@@ market , which gives him 3,@@ 000@@ th gain &quot;
&quot; the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured its 3,@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market on Friday . &quot;
&quot; he bet on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction , which is trained by John Gos@@ den , a milestone on his local race track with his second win of the night . &quot;
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey , reaching the milestone in the flat race . &quot;
&quot; he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who won first on G@@ ha@@ yy@@ ah , said : &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is also here
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I ended up here 30 years ago .
&quot; it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a mund@@ ane Friday evening with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori picks up the che@@ er when he gets the victory on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
&quot; two jo@@ ck@@ eys have reached the milestone in the obstacle course - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who scored more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a career @-@ breaking career . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ b@@ ysi@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career successes &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey in the modern world and it &apos;s no surprise that he has reached this milestone that few have reached before him .
&quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intel@@ lect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charism@@ a thrilled fans for years for this kind of sport . &quot;
&quot; I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already scored 6,000 wins if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey ! &quot;
Frank@@ ie has suffered more than 30 years of winners in the UK . what &apos;s great .
&quot; he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; flying from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades . &quot;
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
&quot; a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven , &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a ban on drugs . &quot;
&quot; three years ago , he had difficulties when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive strength to def@@ y his two @-@ fl@@ yers and to return to his best form . &quot;
&quot; and he hasn &apos;t come to an end for a long time - D@@ ett@@ ori said earlier that he wants to continue with competitions up to his at least 5@@ 50,000 years of age . &quot;
Russia Putin fires head of staff Sergei Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has un@@ expect@@ edly released his Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of Putin &apos;s narrow confidence circle for many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed the Special Represent@@ ative for the Environment and Transport Affairs .
&quot; in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin it is that , without giving reasons , Putin has ordered the dis@@ mis@@ sal of Ivan@@ ovo from its duties as Chairman of the Russian presidential administration . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been deputy to Ivan@@ ovo since 2012 , has been named his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; born in Tall@@ inn in 1972 , he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website ( in Russian ) , he later became the chief executive and staff leader of the government . &quot;
&quot; commenting on his appointment , he said to Putin : &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot;
I think it is the government &apos;s main task to support your work as head of state regarding bills of law and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked him to leave his post and have recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
are the smiling faces convincing ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
&quot; Sergei Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of Vladimir Putin &apos;s closest confi@@ d@@ ants , working as he did for Soviet intelligence , the K@@ GB . &quot;
&quot; as a staff of staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff res@@ igned on his own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the smile for the cameras , there are only a few of them convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
is this the result of a sort of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at the moment .
but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who was once promoted as a potential president - would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - met great scep@@ ticism .
&quot; in his remarks to Putin cited on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I asked you in early 2012 in a conversation to give me this very complicated post - you could almost say - entru@@ sting posts for four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential office for four years and eight months . &quot;
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V accepted the post in December 2011 .
previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was Chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was named his deputy . &quot;
&quot; when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov one of five people whom he trusted most . &quot;
&quot; once it was believed that Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term , as a third term of Putin had viol@@ ated the constitution . &quot;
&quot; but this post was taken by another close ally of Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot;
Putin became Prime Minister before he was elected president three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son was involved in a physical examination on set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios that produce the series announced their termination in a joint statement .
&quot; Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , ap@@ ologi@@ zed on Thursday before the announcement of his cancellation . &quot;
at the set there were artistic differences and a dis@@ agreement .
&quot; I repent the incident , &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot;
&quot; details on how the character Gib@@ sons from the series , which follows a team of F@@ BI agents , will probably be published at a later date , according to the position of ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios . &quot;
&quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who previously played in the Sit@@ com Dhar@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , was involved in the first season of the series in 2005 . &quot;
&quot; I love criminal mines and put my heart blood in the last twelve years , &quot; &quot; said Gib@@ son in a message published on Friday . &quot;
&quot; I was hoping to be there until the end , but it will not be possible anymore . &quot;
&quot; I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans , who can only wish for a series . &quot;
the planned broadcast of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for 28 September .
ri@@ dd@@ les around fish landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
one inhabit@@ ant of Ban@@ ff requested help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that the 75 fish could be a sand@@ a@@ dish that was filled out by a fountain .
&quot; Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published on Per@@ is@@ cope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish . &quot;
Que@@ ens@@ ferry crossing : bridge is now connected with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017
&quot; engineers have connected the North deck of the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings to the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct , meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe . &quot;
&quot; it is the first of four clos@@ ings of the &quot; &quot; ceiling b@@ lower &quot; , &quot; which approach the completion by each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons . &quot;
&quot; it has 10,000 metric tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 til@@ ted ropes . &quot;
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017 .
Minister Keith Brown made a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country .
he said : &quot; this is a historic and symbolic moment when building the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings .
&quot; we are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic degree in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , completion of the connection between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit . &quot;
&quot; in total , almost 79 % of the total bridge deck is at its place and the last section of the deck is now available in Ros@@ y@@ th for the deck , meaning that the whole deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , Project Manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure is a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot;
&quot; in this fantastic project , the sh@@ utter represents future @-@ proof high @-@ end and civil engineering . &quot;
&quot; after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the extension of the northern tower , we had to close the gap in the north or country side . &quot;
this was achieved by pulling the northern Zu@@ cken Bridge 700 milli@@ metres south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
&quot; massive , as the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 2@@ 22 meters long , weighs approx . 6.000 tons and had to be pulled upwards with a slope of about 3 % . &quot;
&quot; because the toler@@ ances on which the team were working were tiny - on each side , they only hit a few milli@@ metres . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , everything went very well . &quot;
rescue in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men are lucky to be alive
three men have &quot; luck to be alive &quot; after they were thrown from their fishing boat to Angl@@ es@@ ey .
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station struck on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alarm after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
&quot; the three men had difficulty to swim , while their boat moved on from their own strength . &quot;
&quot; we saw how the boat turned around and set the worst off , &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds have already blown the boat out of reach until we left water , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found hang@@ ed on a bo@@ per without a life@@ jacket . &quot;
they all came aboard the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station .
&quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water have luck un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot;
&quot; the boat engine had an emergency stop , but it loos@@ ened itself when the boat was boar@@ ded by the person who controlled the boat . &quot;
someone has watched over these men today .
badly injured - man pun@@ ches on his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and severely injured .
&quot; as the police told yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the key to the apartment to pick up his personal bel@@ ong@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; instead , the alcohol @-@ ized perpetr@@ ator cut the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; when they came into the apartment , he stab@@ bed them twice . &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured by the hand and on the body .
the police could arrest the perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed his ex @-@ girlfriend &apos;s clothing , he called his mother . &quot;
this prompted his sister .
&quot; together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother . &quot;
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
that is why she went out of the house with her partner .
on the street they met the husband &apos;s ex @-@ life companion .
&quot; when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
who is building favorable apartments in Braunschweig ?
the SPD and Green said : &quot; in the future investors should be put a lot more seriously in the future . &quot;
how do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheaper apartments over the next few years ?
the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; housing concept &quot; for the next council meeting .
but stri@@ fe is programmed .
&quot; first and foremost , it is about the question : who should actually build the cheap apartments ? &quot;
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; said S &amp; D Group President Christoph Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban areas must in future evi@@ ct 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot;
&quot; however , the cheap apartments can also be created in the inventory . &quot;
&quot; however , the great controversy in the town hall is , however , Brat@@ mann : &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private land ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas , but as much as 20 percent of apartments as social housing . &quot;
&quot; a new urban residential construction project , which will cost millions and is still to be financed , should provide incentives for incentives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , according to Brat@@ mann : &quot; there is currently no agreement between the frac@@ tions . &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few regulations as possible .
the left wants even harder constraints for investors .
&quot; despite this , as a viol@@ ist , there is a sharpen@@ ing of the situation on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; if the concept of action is implemented , it will take care of additional tasks in the construction administration . &quot;
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers .
&quot; the programme is not yet complete , because the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot;
&quot; but how does one reconci@@ le the loss of further around 1300 cheap apartments , whose promotion is going to exp@@ ire in the next few years ? &quot;
&quot; by 2020 , it will be 500 apartments . &quot;
&quot; to prevent this from happening , the planning policy spokesperson Nicole Palm , should now be bought out b@@ ind@@ ings from the city . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would have to be thought of getting the apartments back to the price relationship . &quot;
this is possible in the western city .
&quot; in one fell s@@ woo@@ p , the problem could be solved . &quot;
for in the West stadt there are periods of time at the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price relationship for cheap apartments .
&quot; only : this does not want the owners , the housing associations . &quot;
&quot; since the number of social housing in the western city is again dr@@ astically increased , one is removed from the goal of the so @-@ called mixing . &quot;
there is no more concentration of social weak in just a few parts of the city .
the Gre@@ ens expect there will be some movement in the discussion .
&quot; said S &amp; D Group president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke : &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U has to go into the boat . &quot;
&quot; in fact , I concentrated on more space for single @-@ family homes . &quot;
but what does not mean that a compromise is not yet to be found .
&quot; Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness , worth it &quot;
it is fascinating to see how the world changes .
&quot; teenagers and children are no longer going to play outside , but rather prefer to spend their free time star@@ ing on screens , has been lam@@ ented by many over the last decade . &quot;
Pok@@ emon Go is about bringing people away from the sofa and getting more active .
&quot; the time on the screen was initially limited to TV , then on vide@@ og@@ ames and last on smartphones . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it &apos;s great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other . &quot;
&quot; of course I am referring to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters that were initially created for the video games in the 1990s ( later they created a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) . &quot;
&quot; like many of the phenomena of pop culture , the interest in the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand declined in early July . &quot;
market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed due to the massive demand that over@@ loaded the servers .
&quot; within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter . &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , players go out with their smartphones out and search for Pok@@ é@@ mon , which are tracking with a GPS and once they have been found they can be &quot; &quot; photographed &quot; &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the train and jumped for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the U.S. , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person withdraw@@ s every day . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ di@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , which pursu@@ es 35@@ ,000 users , recently told Washington Post that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of tra@@ cked people , who train every day 30 minutes , jumped 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
the company does not know who plays on Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees the raw data for improving performance .
&quot; many public awareness campaigns for health , people want to take 30 minutes to get &quot; &quot; off the sofa &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; being active every day &quot; &quot; beat on deaf ears , because many public messages are boring for health and come from people who look el@@ end . &quot;
&quot; however , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ rated . &quot;
&quot; who regularly drives sport , reduces its chances of developing cancer or depression . &quot;
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here . &quot;
but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
&quot; thus , three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun . &quot;
some people even close new friend@@ ships at the hunt .
&quot; as always , there are also gru@@ es@@ ome game destro@@ yers who always have to complain about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could run against a door . &quot;
what should it be ?
it has become a breakthrough .
&quot; even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit have already followed our activity earlier , they have no reason to do sports as it does this game . &quot;
the new will lose its charm and the use will decrease with time .
&quot; however , due to Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world and help many people in the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and healthier . &quot;

Sim@@ one Bil@@ it creates gold in the Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Sim@@ one Bil@@ it is immune to all this .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
absolutely brilliant .
and now also the Olympic Champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old gymn@@ ast gro@@ omed on Thursday to win the title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
&quot; her total score of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly ahead of the silver med@@ alli@@ sts and &quot; Final Five &quot; team mates A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze med@@ alist Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; the American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ a Tur@@ ns on the Swedish bar during the solo fight for women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ a is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osexual American who wins a multi @-@ campaign title and is the fifth , while consoli@@ dating its reputation to be the best of its generation or even at all . &quot;
she burst into tears as her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment ended .
&quot; this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes , such as Michael P@@ helps , who have brought their sports to new heights : &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ a has won the sport for the last three years , 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Rett@@ on said she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot; &quot;
&quot; she expected her last examination in Brazil , a contest that did not so much between Bil@@ lion and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be considered a disappointment . &quot;
&quot; the American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ a , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after winning gold and silver in solo multi @-@ fight women at the Summer Olympics 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ a took the first medal on Tuesday , while she served Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i as an ex@@ clamation at the farewell party of the retired man coordinator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i . &quot;
&quot; although it insi@@ sted that during their long distance to the top , never planned the future , this is not really true . &quot;
a part of her floor exercises - which contain her typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is adapted to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympi@@ a@@ arena in Rio .
this is not a coincidence .
&quot; this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school excursion into the gym , was trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man , became a force . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2013 , she has not lost a winning competition , a winning stre@@ ak that will last for as long as Bil@@ a wishes . &quot;
&quot; even though Mu@@ staf@@ ina was slightly deceived by two turns , the picture was clou@@ dy . &quot;
floating bar and ground anten@@ nas - in which Bil@@ a holds the world title - lau@@ ded .
&quot; she took another 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the beam bar again - and with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor still sat on it . &quot;
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her sof@@ tly as she expected her final - a pure form@@ ality - and tears stre@@ amed with bright red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her book book became reality . &quot;
&quot; the achievement of Ra@@ is@@ mans was revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place , but the bronze medal in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke passed to Mu@@ staf@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old female capit@@ aine , which is called &quot; &quot; Grand@@ ma &quot; &quot; by the Americans , had a lead . &quot;
&quot; after her practice , she threw down the crowd , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed dou@@ bt@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; as for Bil@@ lion , the fast spreading twe@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week : &quot;
police : 3 victims in mass mur@@ der@@ ers shot at the music hearing in the car
&quot; according to police reports , published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl killed in one of the most le@@ thal attacks in the first mass mur@@ der@@ ous attack by Phoenix while they stopped in the car and listened to music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Rochelle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand @-@ fire weapon , while he stood on the passenger side of the car and then fled to another vehicle , is read in the report . &quot;
&quot; the police told me that the thre@@ ef@@ old murder did not seem to have been the result of a predat@@ or , as the attack@@ er didn &apos;t take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 belonging to one of the adult victims . &quot;
Phoenix &apos;s police spokes@@ man Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether it is associated with four previous attacks .
&quot; in total , seven people were killed predominantly in His@@ panic homes within four months in nine attacks and two others were injured . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; shared Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that the suspect has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ an from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincol@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the investig@@ ators refused to expose the evidence that they had led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked , and were committed by the same mur@@ derer . &quot;
&quot; El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to her injuries and died later . &quot;
&quot; liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site . &quot;
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for her to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
&quot; the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which aimed at an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the three @-@ fold murder and assumed that it was the work of the serial killer . &quot;
investig@@ ators found bul@@ let sleeves and secured a ball of the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 year old with micro@@ cephal@@ y : &quot; it &apos;s going to be better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ olds , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but like the f@@ ew@@ est of his old age , Ed@@ mund is a micro@@ cephal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; when he first came home , my first thought was , I don &apos;t manage that . &quot;
I don &apos;t manage that .
I did not let myself in .
&quot; what &apos;s not right at all -- of course , one has sat on it , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
Vincent and her husband told her that under certain circumstances Ed@@ mund will never be able to see it and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; my first answer to this was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do &apos; , &apos; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot;
Ed@@ mund is able to walk with help of a subsi@@ dy .
Ed@@ mund was unable to sit or craw@@ l until his third year of life and he still can &apos;t speak .
but he is slowly making progress .
he can run and cycle with support .
he loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Ed@@ mund decided for &quot; Please sing me something . &quot;
&quot; we bring him a sign language , &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot;
but it is not a typical sign language -- says she . Ed@@ mund alone invented a few characters .
&quot; micro@@ cephal@@ y has a variety of causes : genetic as in Ed@@ mund , as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy . &quot;
the symptoms and forecasts may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of those infected with the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to recalls the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t really know .
&quot; I have been asking for the pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect it to really tell me someone . &quot;
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
it will be better .
you know it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
&quot; floods in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi &quot;
heavy ra@@ ins and large @-@ scale floods in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call on the emergency stand on Friday . it will be reck@@ oned with more rainf@@ alls all Saturday .
&quot; numerous rivers in the southeast of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi river floo@@ ding their shores and threatened with large floo@@ ding after extreme rainf@@ alls , the National Weather Service reported . &quot;
governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards shared that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and are already on their way to the affected communities .
&quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Pre@@ par@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , announced that the requests for flood @-@ water vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags were spreading . &quot;
Ste@@ ele said that only the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had asked ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is used across large parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana up to Saturday .
the weather service announced that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area .
&quot; in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama a flood early warning system was used on Friday , while in the area of Mobile it was still ra@@ ining . &quot;
&quot; the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will probably reach record levels throughout the weekend . &quot;
the met@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
&quot; he also said that a downstream floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , as these rivers flow slowly into the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as over the tro@@ dden rivers . &quot;
&quot; the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi River border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest stand on Friday , which was ever recorded . &quot;
rescue teams drove still people from the flood water in the districts Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
&quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were saved on Friday near Glo@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally located more than 400 feet from his house , asc@@ ended overnight . &quot;
he said that another step@@ son who lives near him would have warned him .
&quot; we woke up and the water flow@@ ed and poured in , &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot;
it reached my waist .
Hans@@ ford said his wife that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years she lived there .
Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members would have all disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that emergency hel@@ pers had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster where they stayed until Friday .
&quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the floo@@ ding had spread &quot; &quot; quickly &quot; &quot; as there were still severe ra@@ ins and that the authorities considered evacu@@ ation instructions . &quot;
&quot; according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer announced in the vicinity of Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain . &quot;
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that rainf@@ alls had been significantly reduced since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy ra@@ ins and street floo@@ ding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and lessons in five schools .
&quot; the C@@ BS subsidiary , WW@@ L , reported that a co @-@ ordin@@ ate in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa received 200 flooded houses . &quot;
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated in two churches that were now both flooded .
&quot; the leader of the municipality Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets , which were r@@ ins@@ ed by flood . &quot;
&quot; in the towns of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were established to accommodate the evacu@@ ated people . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the water begins to go back , they will be able to return to their homes , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the city Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of streets were closed due to the floods and sand@@ bags for the residents were provided for taking part , who hope to be able to keep the water from their houses and stores . &quot;
&quot; the last big flood we had was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
&quot; in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of the Har@@ rison Count@@ ess said it ra@@ ined on the Gulf Coast . &quot;
&quot; according to the data , a handful of houses on Thursday were reported to be floo@@ ding , but no reports have been reported on Friday . &quot;
&quot; Keith T@@ own@@ son , manager of Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ve seen water in places I &apos;ve never seen before , &quot; &quot; said T@@ own@@ son , &quot; &quot; and it still comes . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 &quot; &quot; perfor@@ ated by balls &quot; , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia &quot;
&quot; the police tells us that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child is shot . &quot;
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; grand@@ parents testified that Brown suffered several injuries , including in the lo@@ ins , leg , arm , and belly , but that he was in the hospital when they were transported to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; he has gone through a lot , his little body was perfor@@ ated by bul@@ lets , &quot; he shared his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the transmitter . &quot;
I can &apos;t believe it .
the condition of the boy was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family shared the transmitter that it is expected to recover .
he should have started the first class in a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in a stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
&quot; the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is in a critical condition , shot up , reports the transmitter . &quot;
the other two victims were not in the car and the police as@@ cer@@ tained whether one of the injured men could be the perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; investig@@ ators told C@@ BS , Philadelphia that it seemed to have come to a cross@@ fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; bul@@ let sleeves for assault rif@@ les , which have been traced back to various assault rif@@ les , over@@ saw the crime scene . &quot;
it seems that this is clearly a continuing fight .
&quot; on the road , on both sides of the walk@@ way , there were seals . &quot;
&quot; it seems that there have been several armed comb@@ at@@ ants involved , who were very active involved , &quot; reported police officer Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di the police in Philadelphia to the sender . &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles hit in the area .
&quot; there was no arrest and the police are currently checking out the surveillance video , according to reports . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a cross @-@ ag@@ ger at the arm , when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane . &quot;
she reco@@ vers and the police still looks for a suspect .
&quot; why we need Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot;
this is what I imagine under the women &apos;s olymp@@ ic championship in gymn@@ as@@ tics and that for more than one reason .
&quot; first , I have been involved in every summer Olympics since 1984 and the United States has never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; second , this team has three gymn@@ asts , Sim@@ one Bil@@ a , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin colour . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew@@ ess is and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian who is Catho@@ lic@@ ine , makes everyone proud . &quot;
this team is finally mirr@@ oring the USA .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and h@@ is@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
&quot; in the last four years , the number one among female gymn@@ as@@ tics was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American woman . &quot;
last year Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
this shows strength .
&quot; during the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic champion and America che@@ ered . &quot;
&quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible achievement of the three times world champion Sim@@ one Bil@@ a , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they delivered unexpected , but master@@ ful gy@@ nec@@ tic routines . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Sim@@ one became the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osexual American who won gold at an individual multi @-@ campaign event . &quot;
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
&quot; we experience the peak of this sport , but so gymn@@ as@@ tics in the whole country do not look . &quot;
&quot; Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie beat all the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to make it into the olymp@@ ic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; , &quot; because the next Olympic team will have only four female gymn@@ asts in the team . moreover , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality is that gymn@@ as@@ tics are an expensive sport and gymn@@ asts primarily arise in private trainers , which are maintained by parents for training , training , travel clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their gymn@@ asts and families ) . &quot;
the majority of these Turn@@ stones are in prosper@@ ous suburbs that can support the business .
&quot; in these clubs , the gymn@@ asts get their entire training and that is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Sim@@ one Bil@@ a , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , trained both her athletes since they started with gymn@@ as@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; we have to be inspired by numerous young girls inspired by Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a more affordable and accessible gym training . &quot;
I founded my Turn@@ Foundation for 20 years .
&quot; at my events , we offered free and affordable gymn@@ as@@ tics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youth ( especially black and h@@ is@@ panic ) and trained national and international vic@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer young people high @-@ quality gymn@@ as@@ tics , which deserve the opportunity to learn and profit from this great Olympic sport . &quot;
&quot; gymn@@ as@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health as well as for school and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that will bring thousands of young girls to interest in gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
&quot; it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls . &quot;
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; thank you Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the holding of the Olympic team gol@@ ds and thank you , so many young girls with different backgrounds are motivated to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
assistance doctors want to organise further strikes after rej@@ ecting Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal
&quot; the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed treaty with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.@@ 000 resident doctors refused to vote . &quot;
&quot; in July , Hun@@ t had revealed plans to introduce the treaty , and said that the N@@ HS would be in a &quot; &quot; No Man &quot; &quot; and any further delay would be harmful to the employees and patients . &quot;
&quot; the first assistance physicians will receive a new contract , which contains changes to night and weekly calendar contributions to improve care at un@@ favorable times . &quot;
&quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , chair@@ woman of the BM@@ A committee for assistant physicians last night in a communication with : &quot; &quot; resident doctors have serious concerns about the proposed agreement , in particular that it will hei@@ gh@@ ten the current workforce crisis and address it to treat all doctors justice . &quot;
&quot; with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors falls under the new contract , progress has to be made and the time runs out . &quot;
&quot; the BM@@ A &apos;s efforts to resolve disputes caused by talks clas@@ hed with the government on reluct@@ ance , and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence . &quot;
&quot; this happened to a promise that Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t had done last month , that his door would always be open . &quot;
&quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t has to act now , lift up the condition and address the concerns of the resident doctors . &quot;
&quot; if he does not do so , the doctors have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further work campaigns . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a surge of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved to cover doctors on the strike chain cover . &quot;
the ministers hoped to finish the dispute over the amendments by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed treaty with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the BM@@ A wants a better weekend compensation for the 5@@ 4,000 Assistant Doc@@ tors who are subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of N@@ HS employees , requested the assistance doctors to end the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; working combat activities achieve nothing of the little , but burden already heavily loaded teams and service providers and prepare patients , nur@@ ses and their families only concerns , distress and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
&quot; in the last two months , we talked to the committee of the resident doctors and responded positively to concerns regarding the tut@@ el@@ age and whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ c@@ ings with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries . &quot;
&quot; employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as sending , flexibility in training , training camps , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training vac@@ ancy and the Ministry of Health concerning compliance with the agreements with the BM@@ A in November , February and May were . &quot;
&quot; the £ 2 @-@ per day medicine , which can reduce heart risk risk &quot;
thousands of heart attacks will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per @-@ day drug once advised by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the inhibit@@ ing medication T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
&quot; the drug is administered for 12 months following a heart attack , reducing the risk of stroke or further heart attack . &quot;

the N@@ HS regulation authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
about 140@@ ,000 people suffer from a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer from a further heart attack or stroke . &quot;
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls that form plaque .
&quot; when the flooring breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots , which c@@ aches the flow of blood to the heart and thereby causes a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; when the blood cl@@ ots triggers , it can flow through the blood stream and clo@@ g the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke . &quot;
individuals who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another .
&quot; T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trading name of Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more likely . &quot;
&quot; the draft bill of N@@ ICE , published today , recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Technology Evaluation Center said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have considerable negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in combination with aspir@@ in in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who already had a heart attack .
&quot; due to a preliminary recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it . &quot;
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
political Cor@@ rect@@ ness culture boo@@ sts election fraud in Muslim areas
&quot; the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man was removed from office for corruption last year , due to corruption . &quot;
a culture of political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to widespread election fraud in Muslim communities by know@@ ingly being ignored as a destructive government report today .
&quot; the former member of the Cab@@ inet of Cab@@ inet Sir Eric Pic@@ les verb@@ ally attacks the police , observers and town halls to have ignored evidence of election abuse due to &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former minister of integration and communal government , who is now an Ant@@ inous King , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious reasons would be so bad that the police were allowed to set up shut @-@ off bands outside of the cabinet to protect frigh@@ tened voters . &quot;
&quot; he recommends that voters should have an identity card , in order to prove their identity in elections . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , a vot@@ er has to name only his name and address . &quot;
&quot; the report proposes not to apply removable ink to the finger of a person if they release their voting voice , in order to prevent someone from choosing twice . &quot;
whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should get more protection says Sir Eric .
it demands that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions of non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; this serves not only against electoral fraud , but also to protect the local government from the wider corruption and finance culture that comes with it , &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ let &apos;s electoral sc@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
&quot; last year , a special case decided that the current mayor Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man should be dismissed after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry . &quot;
the court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; cy@@ ni@@ cal &quot; and that he had sil@@ enced his critics with racism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of im@@ itation in which one person was chosen as someone else .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud across the country . &quot;
he expressed himself particularly alar@@ ming about the frau@@ dul@@ ent letter choice - when the older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
&quot; Sir Eric , depicted , made several recommendations to clean up the poll@@ ing system , including guiding outs to prove the identity &quot;
&quot; in his report it is said : &quot; &quot; evidence was made that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exercised , especially women and young people to vote in accordance with the will of the elderly , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or Banglad@@ es@@ hi background . &quot;
there have been concerns that ... state institutions have know@@ ingly ignored such a behavior because of &quot; politically correct &quot; interference with regard to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion .
&quot; Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition that political activists are working on letter voting documents to stop &quot; picking . &quot; &quot;
the report commissioned by Ther@@ esa May requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral list being used for immigration and social fraud purposes .
consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID .
do not remove removable ink on the finger of a person as soon as she has left her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice .
systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to ensure that they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications for an automatic letter selection .
prohibition that political activists edit full post @-@ elections and envel@@ opes of letters .
police will give the authority to set up lock@@ outs in order to set up poll@@ ing stations .
&quot; a change in the law , which facilitates an indictment for in@@ timi@@ dation in accordance with the &quot; Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 &quot; ( Legisl@@ ative Dec@@ ision 1983 ) . &quot;
shooting ban in poll@@ ing stations .
requirement that only English can be used in the poll@@ ing stations ( except Wales ) .
&quot; intensi@@ fication of the training , to make sure employees generally enforce that voters go on their own in the election cabin . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; &quot; amazing &quot; &quot; that after Tower Ham@@ let case no criminal complaint was made . &quot;
&quot; the Elec@@ toral Tribunal declared l@@ ut@@ ary Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices un@@ suitable , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; due to a number of reasons , it was found guilty as a result of the high requirements in criminal proceedings . &quot;
he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &apos; check checks &apos; of the town halls &apos; elec@@ tive registry .
&quot; Sir Eric said , &quot; The court sentence in Tower Ham@@ lets of last year was a warning signal . &quot;
&quot; our country , as the mother of parliam@@ ents , bears a proud heritage , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot;
crazy about K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger and other famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger from Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ lern in Rio
&quot; this week , fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio have come across the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ PRE@@ VO@@ T , out of the edge and band who proved to be an impressive Doppel@@ gän@@ ger of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge . &quot;
&quot; but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympi@@ oni@@ kin is by far not the only ath@@ lete who has his own famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger - at least not , if one is allowed to believe the social media . &quot;
&quot; in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that currently fli@@ cker on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympi@@ ans that have more than a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; the hunter and the wolf : team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , has been compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood &quot;
&quot; apart from K@@ ate &apos;s Doppel@@ gän@@ ger on the race track , many people on the internet showed how a certain arch of the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi could be Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio . &quot;
the team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a rush on Twitter after pictures on which he looks very much like the Wolf of Wall Street Star .
&quot; in fact , the ar@@ cher got ins@@ anity into the social media and admitted he had already heard about his childhood that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I myself do not see any great simil@@ arity , except the facial hair , &quot; said Bra@@ dy of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I &apos;ll take it as a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ jumps Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
&quot; the Russian gymn@@ ast , Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina , with her big , expressive eyes , is supposed to be a Doppel@@ gän@@ ger for the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an . &quot;
&quot; and in the swimming pool , the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years . &quot;
a gear higher : this user believes Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor .
&quot; another sustained comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nicely , who has similar severe ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips . &quot;
&quot; the Russian silver medal s@@ wimm@@ ers Yu@@ lia E@@ fi@@ mov@@ a shows more than just the sun @-@ tann@@ ed skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while American Nathan was att@@ ested by fans , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter &apos;s act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face @-@ shape and eyes &quot;
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others liked the simil@@ arities
theory in space : according to this user there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the pair .
a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and D@@ ex@@ ter &apos;s act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face and eye . &quot;
&quot; other popular compar@@ isons covered Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal winner in the gymn@@ as@@ tics of Gab@@ by Douglas , which is similar to that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union . &quot;

&quot; the Canadian television station C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese float was &quot; &quot; off low &quot; &quot; and died as &quot; &quot; a pig during the race . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the comment@@ ator B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was off when he had to surrender his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m free @-@ style pool .
&quot; Mac@@ Donald who had been brought on board in the commentary team of the C@@ BS , to give more &quot; colour , &quot; could be heard : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot;

the criticism of B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ don@@ ald on Twitter came fast and hard at which many asked him

&quot; another Twitter user Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ z@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald . &quot;
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and lets us all look like ra@@ cists .
&quot; short time later Scott Russ@@ el , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC programme , ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the comment by Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the commentary was broadcast on a swimming performance . &quot;
&quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wording , we are sorry it happened . &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed for over 90 times at the people who responded to the comment on Twitter
the comment@@ ator colleague Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald .
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology to more than 90 other Twitter users compla@@ ining about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and issued a message .
we regret it sincer@@ ely that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast .
&quot; last night , we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our viewers on the show and our followers in the social media . &quot;
&quot; to clarify one , B@@ yr@@ on &apos;s comments related to the performance of the float and not on her as a person . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate wording . B@@ yr@@ on is very sorry for what he said . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ don@@ ald ap@@ ologi@@ zed to the broadcast and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack . &quot;
&quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the Women &apos;s Pool in the C@@ BC Olympic campaign , he said . &quot;
&quot; I have referred to the performance of the float , and not on it as a person . &quot;
&quot; of course , no dis@@ regard intended and I am very sorry . &quot;

&quot; to ag@@ grav@@ ate the situation , she pat@@ tern@@ ed her look and laid it back into the shelf . &quot;

&quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in store at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman tried under@@ garments , &quot; she went back and left the shop without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; People could not believe what they saw . &quot;
&quot; standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the delivery , pulled out her own ti@@ ghts and pants and tried them . &quot;
&quot; she did not even try to find a little more discreet place to do it - she stood there , che@@ ek@@ y as O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; everybody star@@ ed when they pulled out the under@@ pants , which you obviously did not like , as they put them back into the shelf . &quot;
she repeated the same with three more under@@ pants before she finally decided that you didn &apos;t like anything and went out again .
&quot; she didn &apos;t seem to be bot@@ her@@ ed by someone watching - or thinking about the person , who under certain circumstances would buy the under@@ pants she tried . &quot;
&quot; Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; as ref@@ using to think that someone would take bot@@ h@@ osen to take home a different person and who were not washed . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson , added : &quot; as I got along , the employees tried to withdraw the garments from selling after they went - which is just as good . &quot;
I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had her and went out again and she didn &apos;t get washed .

how to protect oneself against weapons attacks with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit safer for you . &quot;
&quot; we spoke to Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to turn your sk@@ ewer to the sk@@ ewer . &quot;
&quot; if you get closer to you from behind , then you should first turn around , so that you can see your attack@@ er and &quot; go out of the line , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
then grab the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and your shoulder before hitting your face with your free el@@ bow .
&quot; then hit him with his knee in the bar and twist , while the attack@@ er cur@@ bs before pain , the weapon out of his hands . hit him with the barrel in the face and move backwards while holding the weapon on him . &quot;
&quot; for attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the gun line , grab the gun and twist it so that the aggres@@ sor cannot shoot . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , store the weight on the weapon and beat the attack@@ er on your chest , then turn the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and setting the weapon on it . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it happened in Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that a rob@@ ber@@ y is the saf@@ est to hand over your money - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right ch@@ aps his tongue on the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe for a guide
a British trav@@ eller sub@@ du@@ ed his immune system and stran@@ gen@@ ess of a serious test - by li@@ cking out some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
&quot; the moder@@ ator and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k dropped his course on one euro note , a ban@@ ister at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a sink of a tension toilet as well as a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system . &quot;
&quot; before removing any object , he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer to show himself and to show us what he is going to get involved . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight . &quot;
&quot; the thought of empt@@ ying the r@@ ins@@ ing button of a tension toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke with doctors and healthcare professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately nothing he li@@ cked , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
&quot; Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resistance of his bow@@ el , traveling through the world and ate strange as well as wonderful things . &quot;
&quot; from public money to stations to rin@@ se dum@@ pl@@ ings of toilets , the task assigned his immune system to a rehear@@ sal &quot;
&quot; in the film he said , &quot; As a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about what my health concerns and I have put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot;
&quot; in the film , he was justified in any case . &quot;
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
its sample stroke showed a lumin@@ ometric number of more than 4000 units .
&quot; compared to this , the lumin@@ ometric number of freshly washed hands is less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to lick after its lumin@@ ometric number was over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; W@@ right and Finnish manufacturer of milk products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom . &quot;
&quot; in the film he says , &quot; &quot; This comes close to the worst thing I have ger@@ o@@ ed in a toilet . &quot;
there is nothing more dirty than that !
I will not dock here because it is disgu@@ sting indoors .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Vali@@ o .
&quot; the company provides Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains lac@@ tic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the support of intestinal bacteria and immune systems . &quot;
&quot; vali@@ ant Senior Venice President for Snacks , S@@ haf@@ ts and New categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ oren@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ biotics .
we led crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended saying that we said &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment , the importance of gut health and how it is associated with the immune system . &quot;
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had checked out some of the things I need to lick , like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet , which is shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course , there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to lick them and others , in which this was quite difficult . &quot;
I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film .
&quot; in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o from 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents reported lac@@ tic acid bacteria in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines , and 58 percent said they use at least occasionally products containing added lac@@ tic acid bacteria . &quot;
as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family destroyed before del@@ o@@ gi@@ zing social flat in S@@ alt@@ ash / Corn@@ wall
&quot; an as@@ o@@ ci@@ ale family left their social flat after a del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation with a loss of £ 50,000 , because they had terr@@ orized their neighbors . &quot;
&quot; T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; after they were forci@@ bly removed from their property , shocked employees of the housing association found property in an irre@@ parable situation . &quot;
&quot; the walls had cla@@ d holes , wooden boards were torn up , garbage was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubri@@ cated to the walls . &quot;
the family have been res@@ ett@@ led and it is assumed that they are now living in private accommodation
&quot; Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for the house administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said she was afraid that the apartment could no longer be repaired . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for the people here and I think that people do not have to live in this way . &quot;
&quot; there are many things to consider , as this property will probably be seen as not as beautiful as Corn@@ walls . &quot;
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is as well .
&quot; the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror which the family had inflic@@ ted on street fights with bas@@ eball bats , in@@ timi@@ dation of residents , drug abuse , drug trafficking , and excessive scre@@ ams , disputes and flu@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , got an arrangement for anti @-@ social behaviour in June . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which may be demol@@ ished under certain circumstances , old tr@@ ash was found &quot;
&quot; in the estate , where drugs were traded in the past , the wood floor@@ boards were torn up . &quot;
neighbors said they had to fight them on the street and to regularly inv@@ oked the police
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing made her and her partner viol@@ ently by the estate this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation was che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours who said that their lives were made hell .
&quot; one said , &quot; &quot; They didn &apos;t care about anyone . &quot;
we lived for 20 years along with them and it was always terrible .
the countless times we the police say here are incredible .
&quot; this morning we could not sleep . &quot;
we got up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
&quot; now , where they are finally away , it will be beautiful . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it had given the family to cooperate with the local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house , where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years . &quot;
tr@@ ash and old toys were thrown down on the over@@ grown side of the community house
&quot; he added : &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant is saying that it is the ten@@ ant to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and that of their family , since del@@ o@@ cul@@ ation is always the last step to consider Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot;
&quot; this was a very difficult case , as the behaviour was extreme and their deeds had to be aw@@ ful for their neighbors . &quot;
&quot; I appreciate all the work my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community who have cour@@ age@@ ously approached us and gave us the information . &quot;
I hope this development will provide comfort to some neighbours and the message con@@ veys that anti @-@ social behaviour is not tolerated .
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 . &quot;
a dirty mattress that is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ o@@ ving on the ground
&quot; workers in the house administration will now have to remove garbage mountains , which surround the house &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g of cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
Skel@@ don received a fine after she found himself guilty of possession of a drug of class B in commercial intent .
she claimed that the money for a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee Skel@@ don was born in 2013 in a car accident .
&quot; after they were homeless , they assumed that T@@ anya and their partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many room walls of the house were covered with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police say they will deleg@@ ate rent@@ ers who don &apos;t stick to the house rules
Angela C@@ row from De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police informed that del@@ o@@ gic is a clear warning to the other rent@@ ers who do not stick to the house rules .
&quot; this goes to those who think that they can behave without self @-@ repro@@ ach and those who have been har@@ med by such conduct , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal in panic after an eff@@ emin@@ ent military jet beach flying over
&quot; sun wor@@ ship@@ pers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal lived the shock of their lives &quot;
a portu@@ guese P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft of the Air Force placed an unbelievable storm flight
&quot; the air forces stated that it was on a training flight , but insi@@ sted that there was no security risk &quot;
this was the moment when sc@@ ared tourists start to panic after an eff@@ er@@ ent jet crashes over a full beach .
dramatic video footage showed how the military plane flew close to the sun@@ bath@@ ers on the beach section in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
&quot; the vac@@ ation@@ ers jumped up when they naturally began to worry about the noise of the nozzle of the nozzle , without first seeing what was coming on them through the clouds . &quot;
&quot; the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers who posted videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; &quot; it flew very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane fell on me .
tourists at Av@@ eiro &apos;s beach were in panic when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly low .
&quot; today , the Portuguese Air Force admitted that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and to fly so low that this was the only way to recognize them . &quot;
&quot; the spokes@@ man said that the jet was flying slightly deeper than usual due to poor visibility , but the air forces insi@@ sted that security was at no time at risk . &quot;
area fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer in which four people on Madeira Island came to death .
&quot; today , the Portuguese Air Force admitted that the pilot had to fly so low due to the circumstances - strong fog and smoke smoke - which limits his sight . &quot;
the plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify f@@ isher boats as part of the exercise .
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with worry about Sev@@ ille
Sevilla - FC Barcelona is fighting for the first victory in the new soccer season on Sunday .
&quot; Catal@@ ans compete in the du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup against FC Sevilla , the back@@ lash three days later at Camp No@@ u . &quot;
the Dou@@ ble@@ W@@ inner has to ren@@ ounce the Olympic football tournament among others with the defeated cup@@ fin@@ alists and reign@@ ing Europa League champion among others on N@@ ey@@ mar .
also Go@@ alie is missing Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter St@@ egen .
&quot; the German suffered a b@@ ump in the knee in the training , which clari@@ fied the demand for Bar@@ ca at least for the time being in favor of Claudio Bra@@ vo . &quot;
the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen in Barcelona have been competing for the status as number one for two years .
coach Luis En@@ rique made a clear decision so far and left Bra@@ vo in the league but T@@ er St@@ egen appeared in most of the other competitions .
&quot; before the first obligatory match of the new season , the Spanish master doubts about the fitness condition of the team , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0 : 4 . &quot;
also at the 3 : 2 in the rehear@@ sal op@@ p against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. really didn &apos;t really convince .
&quot; Sevilla , in turn , has continued to di@@ gest the 2 : 3 defeat following extension in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and aims for the second triumph at the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with so far , Barcelona is the record winner in this competition . &quot;
Ma Long in its own league table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis champion .
&quot; on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro , the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his fellow country@@ man and &quot; defending champion &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5,@@ 4,4 ) . &quot;
&quot; thus the world ranked first scored the &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; with successes at World Cup , World Cup , World @-@ Tour @-@ Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and just Olympia . &quot;
bronze went to the Japanese Ju@@ n Mi@@ zu@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it into the final game as expected and made the title among themselves .
it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would fetch the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
last non @-@ Chinese on top of the Olympia @-@ podium was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö Legi@@ onn@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
&quot; Ma and Z@@ hang were left to the record alone , between the sentences and in time @-@ outs they had no aches in themselves . &quot;
they pulled back on the tri@@ b@@ une and left their prot@@ rac@@ tors on their own in a fair competition alone .
&quot; the matches up here , I played for my country . &quot;
&quot; in the final I play for myself , &quot; Z@@ hang said lo@@ gically . &quot;
&quot; after the game , gold and silver med@@ alli@@ sts posed with the China flag . &quot;
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly one @-@ sided .
Ma had only really batt@@ led with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old ad@@ versary only in the first set .
after that he set the pace on the plate and left Z@@ hang from there only a total of 13 points .
through the superi@@ ority of Ma was not the expected ro@@ using match .
&quot; nevertheless , there were nevertheless enough breathtaking ballo@@ ons to be seen . &quot;
Mi@@ zu@@ ani won the Bronze Class game against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
&quot; in his quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the white @-@ rus@@ hing rose a rib@@ bed injury , after that , after that in medical treatment , &quot; &quot; ultimately &quot; &quot; had to be content with sheet metal . &quot;
&quot; the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) were , by the way , in similar high table tennis @-@ old Olympia @-@ Fourth . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp ad@@ mits &apos; huge problems ″ in the election campaign
&quot; the leadership of the US re@@ public@@ ans is pla@@ gu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditional conservative federal states . &quot;
presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp has announced short@@ com@@ ings of his election campaign in the past Republi@@ can strongh@@ old U@@ tah .
a rare moment in which the usually large @-@ lane and self @-@ confident multi @-@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aire expressed such a thing as concerns expressed by correspon@@ dents .
&quot; after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within the own Republi@@ can camp , doubts about his success are growing in the battle for the White House . &quot;
&quot; we have tremendous problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp , evangel@@ ical Christians , asking for support in major states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; due to false reports on his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media campaign . &quot;
tor@@ rent republi@@ can strongh@@ olds
U@@ tah is usually a safe bank for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
&quot; according to a survey conducted by Surv@@ ey@@ US from June , Tru@@ mp and his competitor were equal by the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; other institutes see Tru@@ mp in the front , but not with the distance that is common for republi@@ can candidates in the state . &quot;
Arizona and Georgia are also regarded as endangered .
&quot; in an interview by the Sender CN@@ BC , Tru@@ mp responded to the question of how he would stop the advance of Clinton : &quot; just as I did before . &quot;
&quot; and whether afterwards : this will be &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot; &quot;
he does nothing else than telling the truth .
&quot; if it wasn &apos;t enough for him for political correctness in the end , then Tru@@ mp said on . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to press reports , the Tru@@ mp party is said to have threatened to raise funds to support his election campaign , he should not present any better survey values . &quot;
&quot; instead , the candidates of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans would be more responsive to Congress than the arms . &quot;
brain Olympi@@ ad : three dec@@ eption in dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary committee .
Kenya &apos;s athletes face the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympics .
&quot; after a fraud attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic Village , Kenya sent a trainer to his home . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee promptly set up a disciplinary committee to investigate the case .
&quot; a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary informed that the former S@@ printer and present coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , gave a urine sample at the Olympic Village under the name of the 800 @-@ meter runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ I . &quot;
this was reported by the team leaders of Kenya by the dop@@ ing controllers .
the IA@@ AF World Federation has searched the IO@@ C for information about the case to ex@@ ert its own investigations into an IA@@ AF speaker .
&quot; depending on the results of the examination and the following measures taken by the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will evaluate the evaluation , &quot; stated in an IA@@ AF . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the control station and presented himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ I , gave the sample and signed , &quot; explained Kenya Head de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot;
he was in possession of the accreditation of the ath@@ lete who was on the list for training controls of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ I was in Beijing World Cup @-@ fourth over 800 meters in 2015 .
four days before the Ken@@ yan athle@@ tics delegation Michael Rot@@ I was withdrawn from the Rio Games .
he is alleged to have informed about pending dop@@ ing tests against cash payments from his country .
&quot; according to media reports , he allegedly was arrested on his return to Nairobi &apos;s airport . &quot;
&quot; in Kenya , after numerous dop@@ ing appearances , Kenya has been under special observation for some time now . &quot;
&quot; in the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls from the IO@@ C in front of the Rio Games , it was unusual to point out that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted . &quot;
the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency had put a lot of pressure on African land in Brazil before the summer Olympics to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the start of the Olympics .
&quot; as a consequence , WA@@ DA Kenya from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control was compliant with the rules of WA@@ DA . &quot;
Kenya is considered a great runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Peking .
&quot; in a series of TV reports of the ARD , alleg@@ ations were repeatedly raised , that in Kenya dop@@ ing resources are easily accessible and there should be a considerable mentality of sports fraud . &quot;
&quot; IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und recently called for a similar investigation into Kenya , as he had employed in the field of Russian athle@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , it could be proven that in this sport , surface @-@ covering and systematically ste@@ amed . &quot;
&quot; as a result , Russia &apos;s athletes were excluded from the summer games . &quot;
Salzburger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
&quot; in the Shakespeare year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot;
with it a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
&quot; a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bernstein &apos;s masterpiece . &quot;
&quot; the artistic director , Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli , wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled with the role of Mary a youth dream . &quot;
&quot; the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the leadership of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he enth@@ uses . &quot;
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody .
&quot; it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra . &quot;
I would say that we really have Bernstein &apos;s music in our blood !
in this staging Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria .
&quot; she re@@ members with melanch@@ oly her love with Tony , while the younger Maria plays and dances . &quot;
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
&quot; first , because it is musi@@ cally exceptional ! &quot;
and then there would be Mari@@ ana &apos;s personality .
&quot; she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is therefore wise , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passion@@ ately . &quot;
&quot; it resembles me very much , my Italian character , which I have as a Roman , &quot; Bart@@ oli laughs . &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honor for us to work with her .
it is an immen@@ sely generous person .
and Bart@@ oli re@@ counts the compli@@ ment : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
&quot; you see it in each of his movements , in his looks , it is his life ! &quot;
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , which is very important at all ! &quot;
&quot; for American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; highly topical : &quot; &quot; this piece is about prejudi@@ ce and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
&quot; today we have the refugees , then the Pu@@ zzles went to New York , and the New Yor@@ kers didn &apos;t want them . &quot;
&quot; they are the same topics , and they are as powerful today as they were back then . &quot;
59 years later the piece is still relevant .
London &apos;s school ma@@ ids who joined the IS were killed in Syria
&quot; K@@ adi@@ za Sul@@ t@@ ana , one of three British school girls who left London last year to join the IS , re@@ port@@ edly died in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me A@@ kun@@ je@@ e said that a few weeks ago , her family learned about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria . &quot;
&quot; she was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the group &apos;s bul@@ war@@ k in the country , reported I@@ TV news on Thursday . &quot;
Sul@@ t@@ ana was 17 years old and died after her family &apos;s information shortly after she had decided to leave the land @-@ torn country and return to England .
&quot; one can only hope that the only good is in it - as a reminder and warning to others , that these are the risks connected to a war zone - to stop people from ever making that decision , &quot; &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e . &quot;
&quot; in February 2015 , Sul@@ t@@ ana and two other school girls from the east of London got into a plane in the direction of Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border . &quot;
Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family was told that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and within a few months she became a widow .
&quot; Rei@@ d says , Clinton would remain a candidate for the Supreme Court in case of election victory at Gar@@ land &quot;
&quot; Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate the judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ ros &apos;s confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the dec@@ eased judge on the Supreme Court of Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects Clinton to choose &quot; &quot; Gar@@ land &quot; &quot; with a certain degree of certainty . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d later said that he had not yet talked with Clinton if she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulate .
he praised Gar@@ land and said that Clinton &apos;s team would not worry about trouble with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the highest judge for the U.S. Court of Appe@@ als for the District of Columbia .
&quot; RAID said that Repub@@ lic@@ ans blocked the Gar@@ lands nom@@ ination , were lack@@ eys and hel@@ pers of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp . &quot;
he also stated that Donald Tru@@ mp was un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
&quot; Tre@@ ats wants to &quot; &quot; naked calendar &quot; &quot; for &quot; &quot; women and for men &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tre@@ ats Magazin works with photographer David Bel@@ le@@ mere to bring out a 1970s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
&quot; but instead of famous naked people , they want to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses Calendar for 2017 . &quot;
&quot; editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year , that his neck @-@ magazin of Old@@ school @-@ Play@@ boys distinguishes , since &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot; &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently he thinks it does the calendar too .
&quot; we have to return to the presentation of timeless and classical nu@@ dity where both women and men feel comfortable and inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release for the release of the calendar . &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their images online or in person with an open casting appeal in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community charges with mass flight
&quot; anyone who doesn &apos;t care and lo@@ dges Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot;
Kur@@ ische commune Deutschland expects tens of thousands of prot@@ esters to flee from Turkey to Germany at short notice .
&quot; in the medium term it could even be &quot; &quot; some hundred thousand &quot; , &quot; believes the president of the association Ali Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; due to the hard drive of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan following the coup attempt , the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with a few hundred thousand prot@@ ectors from Turkey in Germany , if the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the president of Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; from Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government had already covered Kurdish high@@ bur@@ gers with imp@@ unity eight months ago , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds were fle@@ eing from Turkey . &quot;
&quot; according to the defeated put@@ sch , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks are added . &quot;
many will want to restart in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state that takes up refugees itself in the country &apos;s own country , &quot; &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k said . &quot;
&quot; the head of the Association lam@@ ented the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in Ala@@ din cities . &quot;
&quot; with that , Erdo@@ gan wants to increase the exit pressure to the remaining Kur@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; they are the last big minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been eradic@@ ated or driven out over the last hundred years , &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also CD@@ U member . &quot;
the president of the Association demanded that the federal government positions itself &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot;
&quot; in Germany too , a &quot; witch @-@ hunt &quot; takes place against Erdo@@ gan &apos;s critics . &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
&quot; more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , above all Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists . &quot;
the Brand@@ Brand@@ ung as Gü@@ len @-@ trailer destro@@ ys teachers and other academ@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; whoever does not adapt and lo@@ dges Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and Sä@@ kul@@ ars , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as reported by the newspaper , calling on numbers from the Ministry of the Interior , the Turks introduced the largest group of asylum seekers recognised in Germany before the coup . &quot;
&quot; as of June 30 , this was 11,@@ 3@@ 86 people and therefore almost 29 percent of all recognised asylum seekers ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this survey , they are not victims of war , poverty or lack of perspective . &quot;
&quot; asylum rights under the Basic Law are exclusively political , so from the state side , individually persecuted . &quot;
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go there where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the natives get nothing from the summer campaign with - and the holiday@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
&quot; in 2021 , the Parliament elections will not resume directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; because stupid than so far it is not : summer holidays , heat and land elections - that bites . &quot;
&quot; the locals , who are to be persu@@ aded by the bal@@ lot fighters , are on vacation . &quot;
&quot; most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers who are in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not locals , so don &apos;t choose the country day . &quot;
&quot; there are practical problems : in the holidays hel@@ pers who hang posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers and count on votes at the end , only rub@@ bing hard . &quot;
&quot; until 4 September 2016 , the day of the election and the last day of the holiday , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is once again forced to pass by an election campaign against the people . &quot;
the hot phase when you can say it at all has just begun .
&quot; and there is also something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , has to fear his office . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in p@@ olls . &quot;
exciting is how strongly newcom@@ er Af@@ D cuts off and what remains at the end of the coalition dust .
&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 head of government , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive election campaign . &quot;
&quot; he travels through the land , distri@@ butes roses and chat@@ ting a little with the people , as it did his legendary elo@@ qu@@ ent predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , sailors have got cold feet and Merkel chan@@ cell@@ or Merkel puts the blame on the blo@@ oming of Af@@ D . &quot;
&quot; your refugee policy , you &quot; We create that &quot; has spe@@ eded up the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the most beautiful ministry . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U , with its Spitzen@@ kan@@ di@@ daten , the Minister of the Interior , Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is , when at the wrong time one makes an election campaign at the right place . &quot;
she has been invited twice Chancellor Angela Merkel to mega @-@ climates ; Merkel &apos;s parliament is in the north @-@ east .
&quot; but the target group did not agree , there were more Nordrhein @-@ Westfalen , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , recently in N@@ DR . &quot;
&quot; but it &apos;s a shame not to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel . &quot;
&quot; apart from that , the Nord@@ ost @-@ CD@@ U largely wai@@ ves the usual election campaigns at market places and in front of shopping m@@ alls with paras@@ ols and ballo@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; this , co@@ ca@@ ert means , plays only a &quot; subordin@@ ate role . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Union has also noted that on the country you are br@@ ushing the base , that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people again . &quot;
&quot; it is like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : barely there is in the sides of the country . &quot;
&quot; the Council of the CD@@ U campaig@@ ner Kok@@ ert on his comrades is also self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; they have to go where it hur@@ ts , namely where the people are : village festivals , golden weddings , every birthday party has to be used . &quot;
&quot; because much is on the game , Sell@@ ering has now called his SPD to a particularly committed campaign . &quot;
&quot; in p@@ olls , Socialists and Democrats were last at 22 per cent behind partners CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just close to Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the election of 2011 , the SPD had still won 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Gre@@ ens , the small party with seven percent in the p@@ olls , are likely to make the leap into the country &apos;s day . &quot;
they make a modern virtue out of their vac@@ ations and largely reloc@@ ate their campaign to the Internet .
&quot; online campaign , &quot; he calls the chairman Claudia Müller . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , green campaig@@ ners embar@@ k on search for domestic stimul@@ ants among holiday@@ makers . &quot;
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , just circul@@ ates with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg seas and finds it still beautiful . &quot;
your impression : &quot; leave holiday in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 Rest@@ oration : restaurants suffer from blocking
there is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated .
&quot; for those responsible for the construction work , which start at 5.@@ 30@@ am and end at about 8@@ pm , there are all praise . &quot;
&quot; they have made it all pretty z@@ ak@@ y , &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff from the jet fuel station . &quot;
this is a super team .
there is also no delay .
&quot; the construction site could be moved to the south at the beginning of the week as scheduled , by the end of October everything should be ready . &quot;
&quot; the opposite of those responsible for the construction work is also commen@@ ded , for example when it comes to the establishment of ma@@ kes@@ hi@@ ft drives . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site ander@@ ed on Monday to the south and also the closure of the asphalt road in O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen has been revers@@ ed and thus the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg is again , the traffic situation within the station has relaxed . &quot;
the citizens can now turn from the O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 on both sides .
the ev@@ asive traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were some significant complaints , &quot; says the deputy head manager Florian King , responsible for the technical management of the refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
&quot; the residents of Bach@@ straße , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many cre@@ eping paths were looking for and rather familiar with their navigation device than the sign@@ age . &quot;
what led to the fact that some trucks were fra@@ ying in residential areas .
&quot; as the speed limits were not observed , the community also urged the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen . &quot;
&quot; there were considerable exc@@ esses , &quot; &quot; says King , who made himself informed about the situation . &quot;
there are already two to three per minute heated .
the fastest was on the way at 77 hours of hour in the Tempo @-@ 30 zone .
&quot; since the construction site has been moved , however , it has become qui@@ eter . &quot;
for the business@@ men at B 27 it is only a little con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg the street is open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
&quot; however , that the B 27 rehabilitation has led to sales collap@@ ses , everyone can look through . &quot;
&quot; however , some are more and some less affected . &quot;
&quot; those who have less to do with the end customer , i.e. for other companies , have hardly any consequences for the renovation . &quot;
&quot; also at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er Thomas Sul@@ z talks about a &quot; at most slight drop , &quot; but also ad@@ mits that &quot; the running documentary is missing . &quot; &quot;
the most heavily exploited are the bars along the road .
&quot; Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words . &quot;
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; not only him , but all the restaurants were &quot; hard hit . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil failed . &quot;
we have to be happy about every euro turnover .
&quot; in terms of sales revenue , it increases to &quot; far above 50 percent . &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the street painting has thrown his business &quot; &quot; for two years . &quot;
he had to leave half of his employees .
&quot; if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed , politics would have responded differently . &quot;
&quot; instead , President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request from G@@ öh@@ ner whether there could be a financial compensation , with the hint that the restaurant benefited from the advantages of the situation on the B 27 . now , it must also bear the disadvantages arising from the renovation . &quot;
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties where so much has been handled .
&quot; with all the complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is confident that his restaurant will continue to exist . &quot;
&quot; after all , the family business has been here since 17@@ 15 , and refers to the long history . &quot;
&quot; that other regul@@ ars now look less frequently because of the intri@@ cate traffic guidance , he can understand . &quot;
&quot; if you cannot go down , it is also very different . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the rehabilitation work , his family @-@ kli@@ fts come back again , that is why G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts . &quot;
&quot; despite the crises of BSE and avi@@ an flu , G@@ öh@@ ner sees the effects of the B 27 construction work on its clientele for the biggest crisis that has experienced its restaurant in its many years of history . &quot;
&quot; six months of construction , this is already brutal . &quot;
it is constantly being bol@@ ted to laws on behalf of counter @-@ terrorism .
&quot; following the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère introduces a thick security package . &quot;
but what has a Dul@@ se status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the ser@@ ge@@ ant .
&quot; all his proposals are &quot; politically reasonable &quot; to the coalition partner , &quot; says the Minister of the Interior in presenting his new security package . &quot;
they over@@ take no one .
other more advanced points would first be discussed within the parties .
I also participated in this .
&quot; however , as the Interior Minister , he was at the conclusion of the results and at a &quot; &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; within the coalition . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , the Mai@@ zi@@ ère has left a little time before he presents his conclusions for safety in the Republic . &quot;
but these are all the more extensive .
&quot; a lot is already known , announced , announced : that a new security authority should take care of the un@@ encrypted communication , is not new . &quot;
it is also not the fact that Germany must implement multiple EU directives on passenger data and weapons rights .
the call for more video surveillance and staff for the security authorities is not surprising .
&quot; in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère starts a second run for proposals not to be done with the SPD : he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and kno@@ ck the jihadi@@ sts with double nationality at the German passport . &quot;
&quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; the CD@@ U @-@ man ad@@ mits . &quot;
&quot; he still holds this for reasonable and demanding nothing , which does not have any chances with the coalition partner anyway . &quot;
a few new ideas also present de Mai@@ zi@@ ère .
they have partly in themselves : he is planning rapid procedures for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for det@@ ecting people from deportation .
refugees who are targeted in the country should first check their smartphones and disclose social media accounts for a security check .
&quot; in case of toler@@ ances for rejected asylum seekers , he wants to make some worse than previously - such as comm@@ itting crimes or throw away their papers deliberately in order to disgu@@ ise their identity . &quot;
some of them are politically and legally sensitive .
many also have an un@@ explo@@ ded effect and leaves questions open .
&quot; and at some points , in the un@@ equal treatment of patient , for example , the question arises : what does this have to do with security and terror ? &quot;
&quot; yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the subjects of refugees and terror . &quot;
but it cannot be said that the assass@@ ins of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
&quot; in addition , many people worried about security in the face of the high number of refugees . &quot;
&quot; and things that deeply concern people , could not be stap@@ led even in election campaign times . &quot;
the inner security is enormously concentrated .
&quot; first the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
&quot; and yes , there are electoral struggles . &quot;
the Union and the SPD are therefore becoming increasingly in their position on the subject of internal security .
&quot; in the past few days , there was a high rate between the two parties . &quot;
&quot; only a gar@@ ris@@ ome quar@@ rel on the equipment of the Federal Police , then a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons Interior Minister , in which the res@@ ent@@ arians also demand a Bur@@ ka ban and a return from the dual citizenship . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is also struggling here for conci@@ li@@ atory sounds .
&quot; from a departure from the double @-@ pass , he doesn &apos;t hold anything . &quot;
we have made an extension of the discussion in Germany .
to re@@ plen@@ ish them is not sensible .
&quot; and in case of a Bur@@ ka ban , he has constitutional obj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; whether its own package at all corners is constitutional and whether it is &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; for the coalition partner , must first show itself . &quot;
there is a lot of things that could cause controversy .
&quot; however , the SPD is currently attempting to profile itself on the subject of internal security . &quot;
&quot; Sig@@ mar Gabriel clearly sign@@ alizes the readiness to talk and says : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything , which contributes to improving safety . &quot;
even Volkswagen got off lightly .
&quot; in spite of diesel sc@@ and@@ als , the sales figures worldwide increase . &quot;
but it is not in all markets running around .
&quot; in the recall action , there are vor@@ ti@@ ces around a term . &quot;
Volkswagen starts the second half @-@ year when deliveries are delivered .
&quot; in spite of the diesel aff@@ aires , Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer can continue to show a plus despite the diesel aff@@ lu@@ ent thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ running markets . &quot;
&quot; but in July the core brand VW , especially in Western Europe , weigh@@ ed heavily on the total sales , as announced by the company in the D@@ ax . &quot;
&quot; in July , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the previous year with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars worldwide . &quot;
&quot; in Western Europe alone , China &apos;s second most important market , sales were 14 percent lower than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , the deliveries out@@ war@@ dly sack@@ ed almost one sixth . &quot;
&quot; head of the brand , Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann , boo@@ sted the weaker figures from July mainly on two sales days less in Europe . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in some core markets there has been a reluct@@ ance to buy goods due to &quot; changed economic conditions . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation around the attempted coup in Turkey , British V@@ ot@@ um also stressed the exit from the EU , explained a spokes@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; in the USA , where the exhaust @-@ gas @-@ aff@@ ini@@ ties first escal@@ ated , a minus is also to be found . &quot;
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; all in all , the mainly affected home brand of Lower Saxony has got off lightly anyway through the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only a supply minus of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is available . &quot;
group sales manager Fred Kap@@ pler continued to show a sales increase from January to July .
&quot; Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time , 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide . &quot;
Volkswagen had tam@@ pered with a software exhaust gas testing .
&quot; in Germany alone , VW is calling around 2.5 million vehicles to retro@@ fit into the workshops . &quot;
&quot; as part of the conversion , VW reiter@@ ated that the conversion of cars has no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after retro@@ fitting the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance . &quot;
&quot; after the conversion , the car manufacturer will issue a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate , but don &apos;t speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was said on Friday in corporate travel . &quot;
legal refin@@ ements are the reason .
&quot; the &quot; Focus &quot; had reported that Volkswagen has now given its German customers a guarantee of converted diesel models .
this would have been confirmed by VW representatives in the Ministry of Transport last Monday .
the Ministry of Transport confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; VW has fulfilled the requirements of my inquiry commission and the KBA in full . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; deviations from this will not be accepted , &quot; &quot; declared Federal Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW assumed that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power could not take place after retro@@ fitting and that all type @-@ approved vehicle values remain unchanged . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; but not as it was said in corporate travel . &quot;
&quot; for example , with the wide term &quot; warranty &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that for example , after retro@@ fitting , customers can come to a workshop half a year after retro@@ fitting - and this could lead to the new software , even if the damage does not have anything to do with it . &quot;
&quot; in the interest of customer interest , it is important to avoid that in case of any other damage which has nothing to do with the exhaust sc@@ andal , there is no uncertainty regarding possible warranty regulations , as was said . &quot;
&quot; therefore , VW does not use the term &quot; warranty . &quot; &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands from rich savers in future - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; on Thursday , Bank head Josef Paul said : &quot; it is only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight or day @-@ to @-@ day accounts . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Association of German banks speaks of an individual case and sees it not a signal : &quot; &quot; normal austerity &quot; &quot; should not fear to pay for its austerity measures . &quot;
&quot; when banks deposit money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay their 0.4 per cent penalty . &quot;
&quot; as of September , the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund is charged by private and corporate customers for deposits of over 100,000 euros on sight or day @-@ to @-@ day accounts . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 will cost € 400 in the future , &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot;
&quot; for some time now , he has kept 40 million euros , which could be lifted from one day to another , and which he could not utilize . &quot;
&quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and cause a cost of 0.4 percent , &quot; said the head of the bank . &quot;
&quot; I cannot lay down for every million 4,000 euros . &quot;
the costs are now further reduced according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter pays principle .
&quot; letting cash simply lie in the saf@@ es of the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank would be too dangerous : &quot; I &apos;ve already experienced four attacks , I don &apos;t want the fifth ! &quot; &quot; said the Bank Chief Financial Officer . &quot;
most customers would have an understanding and exchange on other assets .
only a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; the German Co@@ operative Association Bayern declared : &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy causes considerable costs at all banks . &quot;
&quot; to carry it alone , &quot; &quot; economically not possible &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; some German banks therefore have increased their account management fees , credit cards or bank transfers . &quot;
&quot; the Thurin@@ gian Folk and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank in Alten@@ burger Land , with its Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 , made head@@ lines with criminal charges for deposits from three million euros . &quot;
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , Chief Executive Officer of the banking union , said : &quot; &quot; we do not expect private clients to pay widespread charges for deposits , and the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks is much too strong . &quot;
a ban@@ ker said on the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; a clientele made up of wealth a little more opul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; this can become a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; if she jumps for free money . &quot;
&quot; founded in 1911 , the cooperative bank G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; well @-@ known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs are living in the region . &quot;
&quot; there are currently no other banks known to the &quot; Co@@ operative Association of Bavaria &quot; to calculate a reimbur@@ sement for private customers deposits , &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the President of the Bundes@@ verband der deutschen Volks@@ banks and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ banken ( Bv@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go to the negative towards the private customer is very , very high . &quot;
&quot; competition is tough , and it is threatening the migration of investors to the competition . &quot;
the customers in Germany won &apos;t be able to please that in width .
destination Pl@@ ates : who actually bu@@ ys records ?
lonely men middle aged love plates .
&quot; before you come to the comment section , to rip it under the pseu@@ don@@ ym non Alle@@ mon@@ alities male middle age with harsh insul@@ ts , this statement deduc@@ es from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the re@@ emergence of records does not affect a boom in Mill@@ enni@@ als , who want to welcome the news of physical objects , but to Mid@@ life @-@ nostal@@ gia . &quot;
those who recently bought a record are all for@@ esi@@ ght at the age of 45 and 54 .
&quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers . &quot;
there is also no hor@@ des through hob@@ bies - it has an emotional impact : older plate buyers retain their feelings rather for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending alone time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do you agree with the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
&quot; if this blog is a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , taking a modest gray suit and st@@ acking wild before I stop , hold my hands and say something better than : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
&quot; so , let &apos;s take a look at it . &quot;
&quot; even if the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record stores . &quot;
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to switch off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation .
&quot; Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , whom I chose from Si@@ ster Ray ( Number of Files : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) to Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Number of data : eight middle @-@ aged men , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours . &quot;
&quot; is he a collector , I ask ? &quot;
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 panels . &quot;
&quot; these records , shown above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I did not follow him home ) , dress the walls of his living room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they appeared and buy again items he sold when he was young and broke . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy are from the late six@@ ties , early 70 &apos;s who appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I probably were too young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; he agrees that those who buy records are more intro@@ ver@@ ted and would like to spend time alone , and add : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink very much . &quot;
this is my vice .
&quot; 25 , who works at Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers , whom he meets , apply to the You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; he also noticed a new wave of people , who are influenced by the media , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and have set themselves to buy their old records . &quot;
&quot; from the conversations I have conducted , people tend to get rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999 . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records , &quot; he says . &quot;
this would explain the boom of tra@@ ilers of the record revi@@ vals of a certain age .
but what about the supposed emotional significance of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ onica to realize that plate shops offer a cal@@ ming community of like @-@ minded people .
&quot; according to We@@ z , some of the older customers participated in the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;
&quot; some fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar gram@@ ophone records , from objects that evoke happy memories . &quot;
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a empt@@ iness or possession of material possessions as a kind of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; We@@ z says . &quot;
this is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way of dealing mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; a staff whis@@ pers from a stack . &quot;
&quot; a survey by the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month , have not yet heard them . &quot;
&quot; the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record , have no record player . &quot;
&quot; at this time of the news report , I would probably look very worried , while I was browsing through a pile of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( Number of data : three middle @-@ aged men ) , has noticed a &quot; &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; &quot; of the revival . &quot;
&quot; someone came in just recently and said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player , but I would like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead disc so I can put them on the shelf &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens . &quot;
&quot; more productive , less music @-@ grade . &quot;
&quot; we have people who say , &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot; &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older ones , who come in only slowly . &quot;
&quot; F@@ op@@ p , which has devoted the records to almost a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience when I go in . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ age boys and middle @-@ aged women . &quot;
even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts is the latest synthes@@ izer and sex@@ t@@ packed pop instead of experimental jazz from the loud@@ speakers - it &apos;s good to see such diversity among the customers .
&quot; none of them looks odd , but their psychological trauma is hard to imagine when standing next to someone for 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the store for a few minutes and considers the variety of plates available for sale . &quot;
it makes more a window @-@ shopping than a big shopping .
&quot; it doesn &apos;t earn much , so collecting records is not a real option , she says . &quot;
it costs a lot .
&quot; it is easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; she drives off with a de@@ ar@@ est si@@ gh . &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
&quot; while I preten@@ ding to mu@@ zzle the jeans for the jeans , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls who are grouped around for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and daughter consider buying a Cros@@ ley record player . &quot;
&quot; on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of plates of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; no one sees them - perhaps because they are only purely decorative , some so far up that it is impossible to touch them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; plate art . &quot;
&quot; but considering that every attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and some customers could send in the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates . &quot;
&quot; even if my research shows that the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree , at least in record shops in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors , who exist in reality , record shops and online forums , are not considered . &quot;
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .

French court re@@ jects offer on demo@@ li@@ tion of shops in the jungle refugee camp
&quot; a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Cal@@ ais jungle where thousands of refugees live . &quot;
&quot; during a trial hearing this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be able to sell 72 temporary shops where people within the camp sell goods , from cigar@@ ettes to en@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , sell , bar@@ ber services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places were to be demol@@ ished because they would represent a parallel economy , from which no taxes would be paid and that carry a fire and health risk . &quot;
&quot; humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important , as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
they also assumed that the temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in L@@ ille ruled that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people operating the 72 temporary shops , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were &quot; absolutely comprehensible . &quot; &quot;
&quot; judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that food stores , cafés and restaurants would play a much larger role than merely feeding people living in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas provide quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
&quot; one of the places that was threatened by the tear@@ ing was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is operated by charity and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum applications for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
&quot; more than 170@@ ,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the kids &apos; café . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that the closure was &quot; for these children of a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two relief organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated on Friday that the number of Mig@@ rants in the jungle rose to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number until now - following a steep increase in new arri@@ vals during the summer . &quot;
despite Olympic disappointment : Martin remains milit@@ ant

here comes the reinforcement trailer
&quot; Germany &apos;s Raz@@ er must adapt to the next generation speed sensor : in various federal states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flas@@ hes are tested , which should be particularly effective against Tem@@ po@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; the futur@@ istic @-@ acting reinforcement trailer of the Vit@@ ronic company from Wiesbaden can be used , for example , at accident centers , where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police . &quot;
&quot; for example , at highway construction sites or to renov@@ ating bridges with temporary pace buildings , there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with speed limits . &quot;
&quot; however , a permanent mobile design can be too dangerous or costly . &quot;
&quot; reinforcement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days for un@@ interrupted measurement mode , and the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem . &quot;
&quot; with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can be tra@@ cked simultaneously across multiple tracks simultaneously . &quot;
&quot; variable speed limits , as well as drive b@@ ans at the time , travel strips and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
&quot; in the highly @-@ driven state , one can move the trailer according to manufacturer with each car with trailer coupling . &quot;
&quot; so that it is not simply st@@ owed , it is lowered in the measuring mode so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and inci@@ dentally also bul@@ ky outer cover disappear . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter from v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to information provided by Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also being used . &quot;
&quot; foreign authorities also flash with the new technique : recently , France has ordered 100 p@@ cs after an order of 150 pieces last year . &quot;
great Britain picks up silver in 7 @-@ he Ru@@ g@@ by after Fiji &apos;s Master@@ class Gold
&quot; Britain &apos;s impressive performance with 7 @-@ year @-@ old Ru@@ g@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt at the final hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were beaten here in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the San Te@@ odoro stage . &quot;
&quot; Fiji shared a master class in Handling , Side @-@ St@@ epp@@ ing , back @-@ back , line run , and raw power to win gold - its first Olympic version of any color . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was crushed by the not too bad price of the silver medal - Great Britain was fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ fin@@ als the same day , could fall back to them in the final . &quot;
&quot; but regardless of this , a 15 @-@ man team emerged in the form of a 15 @-@ man team . &quot;
&quot; it might be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB - but it will probably not - that at least a Brit@@ on tomorrow will have a gold medal to hang around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben R@@ yan , the former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind it .
&quot; eight years ago , they lost every game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens under R@@ yan . &quot;
here they only lost one .
&quot; this hat@@ ch will hurt , but progress is amazing . &quot;
Fiji began amaz@@ ingly and allowed G@@ Bs to boun@@ ce from fun .
&quot; it felt for the captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell to and Co . , as if you were running in driving buses . the World Series winners were 5 @-@ 0 up , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au ran over in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with four minutes of playing time , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner , which he converted . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB barely touched the ball .
&quot; a gri@@ pping T@@ ackle from Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of Mann Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to achieve a third goal , but it has only stopped Fiji . &quot;
in the seventh minute lete j@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a took a touch @-@ down in the right corner and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
&quot; N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new beginning , and there was still more than a minute playing time ... in the first half . &quot;
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ ided over further weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med down to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
&quot; it &apos;s like Fiji was born to play the 7 , while GB is still learning . &quot;
this is how it is .
&quot; GB led fundamental changes to the half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for entire four minutes , which was good for the circumstances of the first half @-@ time until Joshua went through Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant intermediate play of Fiji . &quot;
&quot; Dan Nor@@ ton launched a trial for GB , made a touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went long in favor of the South African sul@@ tan , whose fans sw@@ ung , flags and danced on the tri@@ b@@ une . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame replaced the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last few seconds .
&quot; the whi@@ stle sounded , the fi@@ j@@ is embra@@ ced themselves and GB ki@@ cked in cr@@ ushing their law@@ ns . &quot;
&quot; earlier on the day , Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi@@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Great Britain pressed South Africa in a tight half @-@ final match from the race - Britain &apos;s conversion to the difference . &quot;
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the ks forward in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke through the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a goal among the posts in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant late tac@@ kling of Marcus Wat@@ son , brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured winning - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by battle with the trainer &apos;s cancer for a ru@@ dder victory
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ inal gold than with these games and that will mean something .
&quot; from the first ru@@ dder to the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve that enter history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning thought of an additional meaning in her golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even though there were only those who were sitting at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . &quot;
&quot; their domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all their 3@@ 9th un@@ beaten work , which is also unprecedented . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant Ath@@ let@@ ins , which gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the kind of triumph . &quot;
behind each gold in rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make a difference to the incre@@ mental advances that make the difference and no one was more helpful than the trainer who did not know before 30 months if he was diagnosed at all when he was diagnosed with cancer .
&quot; as he said , he ris@@ ked . &quot;
I had bladder cancer that is oper@@ able and that &apos;s what they did .
&quot; if you do not do that , it spreads everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a little bit of view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio had good luck that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , if that was the right term in such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to go better again soon . &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice . &quot;
this is how it begins .
&quot; rowing in itself is a challenge , but that makes it even bigger . &quot;
&quot; in the immedi@@ acy of victory , her first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a nervous morning talking about anything else than usual , trying to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; p@@ anning who was a captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery Regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan said , &quot; &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . &quot;
&quot; it just repe@@ ats how much me this means , how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin worked . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
&quot; without Robin we would be no one , so a big thank you to him . he is the best coach in the world . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t have asked for a better person for training or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning lost no race in the past five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
&quot; even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to close , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve . &quot;
we were very caught in the moment .
&quot; Hel@@ en called &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is really important not to let yourself be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not prepared to do something great .
&quot; we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ work today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race what we did . &quot;
the couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about his future .
&quot; Glo@@ ver must appear next week at a wedding , her own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ stroke . &quot;
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
&quot; in London , it took about six months to understand that I was an Olympic champion . &quot;
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; that feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; for 31 years , exemplary for clarity &quot;
&quot; the Managing Director of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , Ru@@ pert Sch@@ öller , is reti@@ ring . &quot;
the association is regarded as &quot; Bavarian @-@ wide exemplary . &quot;
a small Frank@@ ish drinking water sports association as a model for the large water producers .
some time ago it was written in the original on a post by the Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
&quot; little later , the water forum of the Government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia praised the association . &quot;
&quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group &quot; &quot; Bavaria is exemplary &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; behind all this Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was employed for 31 years in the Zw@@ eck@@ verband employee , is 28 years old as managing director . &quot;
now he was retired at the age of 65 .
&quot; the drinking water @-@ purpose association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality Breit@@ brunn , promotes about 150@@ ,000 cubic metres of water per year and supplies 32 places and ham@@ lets with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; the congregations are the municipalities of Kirch@@ berg , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach . &quot;
there are water supply contracts for other towns and municipalities .
&quot; the current chairman , Breit@@ brunn &apos;s mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller has been appointed as a water@@ shed in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband in 1988 . &quot;
&quot; his tasks have been very varied , ranging from water management and maintenance work through office and organisation activities , budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency revenues at weekends , &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
&quot; as an outstanding event , it called the commissioning and inauguration of the new wells ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new wells ( 1998 ) and compensation of the farmers , the renovation of the elevated tank ( 1999 ) , the acquisition of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the renewal of water pipes . &quot;
&quot; there was no stand@@ still and there was always something new , because water is water and water is the most important food . &quot;
&quot; in her lau@@ dation , she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers faithful , reliable and correct service for over 31 years . &quot;
&quot; he has worked with a lot of heart blood for his water purpose band@@ age , and he practically lived the water @-@ purpose association as if it were his own company . &quot;
a few weeks ago he was able to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group to the nit@@ rate reduction in front of the water forum of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia .
for this he received a lot of recognition and praise .
&quot; Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , on his part , praised Ste@@ wart Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked together for 28 years . &quot;
he is the best water guy and he was a faithful boy .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
&quot; as a highlight from his point of view , he described the well @-@ being and restructuring of the Ken@@ nel association . &quot;
&quot; the biggest challenge and the most difficult use , however , were the rup@@ ture at the elevated tank near Kirch@@ berg on a 3rd of January . &quot;
&quot; here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night , so that the villages could be supplied with water . &quot;
&quot; once again , the supply of Neu@@ brunn was only maintained because one filled the high container of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses . &quot;
the management of the drinking water sports association was handed over to Daniel Stur@@ mer from Lau@@ ter who succ@@ eeds Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .

a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot at 10.@@ 45 o &apos;clock in a multi @-@ family home in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( Stor@@ mar@@ n County ) and injured her .
&quot; the man called himself with us and stated to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator was on the run , after whom I was publicly punished . &quot;
meanwhile Sven S. could be travelling by car .
&quot; the man is about 1,80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ baked and has a bald . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the police have published a photo of him . &quot;
&quot; however , it is a few years old . &quot;
meanwhile the man is wearing a bald .
the man should not be addressed directly .
&quot; he could still carry the weapon in himself , so the police . &quot;
anyone who sees Sven S. shall call the 110 .
the police speak of a &quot; relationship . &quot;
&quot; the victim was born in 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator in 1981 . &quot;
&quot; at first the responsible police in Lü@@ beck did not want to give any information about the Ta@@ whe@@ eling or the relationship between perpetr@@ ators and victims , but confirmed that a human being had been killed . &quot;
&quot; it is a killing off@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t say more at this moment , &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lü@@ beck . &quot;
&quot; according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a Special Operations Command ( SE@@ K ) was at the crime scene . &quot;
steel - Licht@@ blick for German steel industry
the crisis @-@ packed and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional costs in millions of dollars .
financial burdens that threatened the industry from green electricity subsidies are from the table .
&quot; the Federal Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; &quot; ( WA@@ Z , free @-@ day edition ) will remain at the release of the Renew@@ able Energy Tran@@ sition in the German steel industry . &quot;
I am really happy that we could finally achieve this after two years of tough negotiations .
&quot; the European Commission , therefore , had planned to ask the steel producers to use the gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption to the cash register . &quot;
&quot; according to German industry associations , the steel industry threatened to cut additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year . &quot;
&quot; Gabriel told the WA@@ Z , there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot;
only when the generators are replaced in the steel works fall an EEG lev@@ y of 20 percent .
but even these are not raised in the steel industry .
the IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission on self @-@ electricity production .
this will largely determine the status quo of the current regulation .
Gabriel &apos;s successful endeav@@ or for the steel industry is of particular importance .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &apos; Steel is future &apos; , this is a first step . &quot;
&quot; others must follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; climate and employment targets are also to be weigh@@ ed in the reform of emission rights law , &quot; &quot; stated Jörg Hof@@ mann , head of Metall , in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry in Europe suffers from over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure . &quot;
&quot; last year , the situation escal@@ ated further , when the world &apos;s largest producer of gro@@ wers threw steel onto the world market in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand . &quot;
European manufacturers reject price dump@@ ing Chinese steel concer@@ tos .
&quot; in the course of this spring , the situation has eased a bit . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , imposed import duties on import steel have an effect , on the other the economic prospects in China have brigh@@ tened up . &quot;
it is unclear how sustainable the price pick @-@ up is .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp remained cau@@ tious on Thursday .
&quot; last but not least , the prices would have been rather stagn@@ ating . &quot;
the sector is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
&quot; in doing so , Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp did not want to exclude the closing of individual works . &quot;
&quot; in the German steel industry , around 8@@ 6,000 people were employed at the end of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in July , the German steel producers are cau@@ tious in spite of rising prices and increasing orders . &quot;
&quot; at 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , as the Steel Community announced on Friday . &quot;
&quot; after a short increase in May , the produced crowd went back for the second month in a row . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production has risen by two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot;
&quot; in the coming months , the association expects an improved order situation with an increased output . &quot;
&quot; community , spirit , health : singing is good for sen@@ iors &quot;
&quot; the singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp for her whole life : as a young girl she was in school choir , she attended the college degree , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir . &quot;
&quot; singing moves me - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; she describes . &quot;
&quot; after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and more alive , she says . &quot;
&quot; by the way , she does something good for her health and her mind . &quot;
&quot; from several perspectives singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German senior league . &quot;
&quot; most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like @-@ minded people , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; by regular meetings , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and cultivate social contacts . &quot;
&quot; because often social and family structures dissolve in old age , a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; to arrange and organize , to be able to rely on others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot; &quot;
&quot; singing can be exhau@@ sting in a positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; for this , sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled respir@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; who regularly asks his lungs , does not get out of the pu@@ ffs so quickly in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice at age , singing is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; for older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Labour Association of Senior Ci@@ tiz@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations shared singing had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both at school and in leisure time , she explains . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening of songs in older people awak@@ ens many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth . &quot;
&quot; through lyrics and especially melodies , even dementia @-@ sick people de@@ cel@@ er@@ ate to long @-@ lying events . &quot;
&quot; in singing , a special achievement is required to the head , explains L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , focus on one &apos;s own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge . &quot;
&quot; just elderly people who live alone are doing so , not just concentrating on themselves . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition you hear through singing in the chor@@ us , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
self @-@ esteem increases through singing in the choir .
&quot; to show yourself : when I practise for something for a long time , I will be better and wa@@ ving beyond me - this experience strengthens . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start singing , there is enough . &quot;
&quot; who wants to try out a new hobby , should not hesitate , even if he thinks little talent , advises L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who hears when a sound goes wrong ? &quot;
&quot; in search of the right offer , sen@@ iors have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; if someone sings from the circle of acquain@@ tan@@ ces in a senior &apos;s choir , you can simply join them . &quot;
many cities also offer views over the choirs in the surrounding area .
those who want to sing in an ec@@ clesi@@ as@@ tical choir can contact the church or the church leader directly .
many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet .
&quot; who does not have access to the Internet , can ask the family , friends or neighbours for help with internet research . &quot;
&quot; if you want to sing , you should definitely join a choir , advises Mr. H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
singing does the soul well and has something liber@@ ating - that applies to all ages .
cats react sensi@@ tively as cats to cries of the k@@ itt@@ ens
bi@@ ologists have investigated in Hannover what effect the calls of cat babies has on adult animals .
&quot; to their surprise , the mi@@ str@@ ust also did not let the males cold - however , they beha@@ ved always the same in contrast to the females . &quot;
female cats can recognize the arous@@ al degree of cat babies in the mi@@ str@@ ust of the little ones .
&quot; they react by ten percent faster to gaz@@ ettes from k@@ itt@@ ens , who have found themselves in great distress , as scientists have found out by the veter@@ inary university and the Medical School Hannover ( MH@@ H ) . &quot;
males also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - however always the same .
&quot; apparently , the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly arous@@ ed young animals for the males are either not perc@@ ei@@ vable or not significant , &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from the MH@@ H . &quot;
she is a collector in the study published this Friday in the &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology &quot; journal .
&quot; in a previous study , the research team had already found out that the length and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens scre@@ am differs with the ur@@ gency of their need@@ iness . &quot;
a total of nine adult males and eight females were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the MH@@ H .
&quot; they were played for a cry of little ones , taken from the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , they were confronted with cries of more excited k@@ itt@@ ens , who were raised in addition . &quot;
the researchers consider their results in spite of the low sample for meaningful results .
&quot; all females , even those who had no offspring , re@@ acted differently to the scre@@ ams , &quot; Kon@@ er@@ ding said . &quot;
they turned faster to the driver when this rep@@ ut@@ ment of the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens was playing .
this ability may be inn@@ ate or evol@@ ves with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have repeatedly investigated the reactions of women and men to baby sounds . &quot;
&quot; several studies showed that women were more sensitive to babies , no matter if they were mothers or not , bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported . &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ ski resorts to Super@@ cup with &quot; Gala &quot;
Hak@@ an Sü@@ ley@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
&quot; in Turkey , an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ ley@@ r . &quot;
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the coup attempt , an important football match is taking place in Turkey . &quot;
&quot; before the du@@ el of the arch@@ rival in Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay , Istanbul for the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line clearly says : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced . &quot;
&quot; even with the suspension of the state of emergency after the attempted coup attempt in July , the government , the everyday life of normal citizens , should not be com@@ promised . &quot;
&quot; this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , whom one is responsible for the attempted coup . &quot;
it is also not possible to stop football in front of the football .
&quot; against the former Stark@@ ie @-@ stool Hak@@ an Sü@@ ley@@ r , the public prosec@@ utor issued an arrest warrant . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , South America living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
Sü@@ ku@@ r is said to be supporters of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the attempted coup by President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
&quot; indeed , the state of emergency decre@@ ed for 90 days is still valid until October , but in fact this does not have any effect on the life of most Turks . &quot;
the ni@@ gh@@ tly &quot; democracy guards &quot; at public places throughout the country has declared Erdo@@ gan on Wednesday for an end .
the sport is - like the whole country - split into supporters and opponents Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the worker club Bes@@ ik@@ tas do not count among the friends of the president .
&quot; but what unites the Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in history , is the strict rejection of military put@@ sch . &quot;
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; at Pok@@ al@@ Se@@ eger &quot; Gala , &quot; it will be especially arriving at Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; the Cologne in the past season proved its sporting value : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first season as a top scor@@ er of his club . &quot;
in the final game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory hit .
the newspaper &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the tro@@ phy to his team .
&quot; thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the ap@@ pointing season for the record master found a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion . &quot;
&quot; after the round @-@ kno@@ ck@@ down in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; also say good @-@ bye to the Europa League . &quot;
&quot; in the South of Li@@ g , it only reached sixth place . &quot;
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; we managed it and that is the most important thing , &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas , the year &apos;s end was better . &quot;
&quot; above all thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who made the basis for the 14th title with 26 seasonal buff@@ ers as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ gate King . &quot;
this is also the reason that the fans will continue to hope for the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; following the coup attempt at AC Florence , the Gom@@ ez had only been announced after the coup attempt , not to return because of the political situation in the country after his EM @-@ holiday . &quot;
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he only has to say it , &quot; &quot; the specialist magazine &quot; &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; Club@@ chef Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; to do so , the stri@@ ker would have to be willing to ab@@ stain from around a third of his estimated 7.5 million euros , Or@@ man made clear : &quot; we cannot pay his salary in Florence . &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes still have medal opportunities at Olympia in Rio
the 34 year old J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova is not allowed to start in Rio .
other over@@ taken athle@@ tics s@@ inner can laugh about it - they fight in Rio for medals .
the topic of dop@@ ing continues to be the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games in Rio .
&quot; the Russian float in Juli@@ ja Je@@ fi@@ m@@ ova , who after a dop@@ ing lock had compla@@ ined her starting right just before the games , was un@@ mer@@ cil@@ essly pin@@ ched and boo@@ ed at her start ( 100 meters breast ) . &quot;
&quot; it was a whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal scene : with a set smile , she was still in the hall and provoked her appearance . &quot;
&quot; as a celeb@@ r@@ ity , they won &apos;t get gold , the audience burst into a che@@ ering storm . &quot;
&quot; but there are numerous other athletes , who go to the start in spite of the dop@@ ing past at the Olympic Games in Rio . &quot;
here &apos;s an overview :
&quot; J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is among the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he was locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
&quot; since its spell , the Olympic champion from 2004 and ex @-@ World Champion is even faster than before ; he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9,@@ 80 seconds and is regarded as the greatest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t . &quot;
&quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Season / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to sit down a six @-@ month lock in 2010 after having been proven by taking the pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; after surgery , she had severe to@@ ot@@ ha@@ che , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old was defending herself . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Per@@ ko@@ vic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the 2012 Olympic Champion , World Champion of 2013 and European Champion , was positively tested for the banned stimul@@ ant agent meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine from 2010 to 2016 . &quot;
Per@@ ko@@ vic denied the know@@ ingly taking and was locked six months .
the four far@@ th@@ est lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the great gold fav@@ ori@@ tin .
&quot; Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ Season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , was tested positive in 2010 and had been locked 21 months . &quot;
&quot; a means for penis enlargement was responsible , stepped forth . &quot;
&quot; this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 meters . &quot;
&quot; Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( hammer throw , Belarus ) : hardly any ath@@ lete was subsequently det@@ ectable as many medals . &quot;
so T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later after he was diagnosed with testosterone dop@@ ing .
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to give Olympics silver 2004 due to ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the EM title 2006 because of testosterone deficiency .
&quot; the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games , also recognized by the International Sports Court of CA@@ S , has also been awarded the bronze medal at the 2008 Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at 80@@ ,@@ 04 m , he ranks second in the world rank@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the world record and gold fav@@ ori@@ tin was first tested in May , but nevertheless allowed to start in Rio . &quot;
&quot; at the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , indications were found on taking a banned dietary supplement , the lock of World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency WA@@ DA decreased mil@@ dly and ran away already on July 13 . &quot;
bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian viol@@ ates - Sever@@ al dead
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the State Department , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; she has suffered inc@@ isions and had been treated in hospital , but I have already left it again . &quot;
she planned her home journey at the beginning of September .
&quot; whether from the other explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ phon also Austrian citizens are also still unclear . &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities , such as waste . &quot;
&quot; in the approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in was initially explo@@ ded on Thursday evening in a Night@@ life two bombs . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dut@@ ch@@ men and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , two explo@@ sives went up and another person was killed , according to the authorities . &quot;
also Ph@@ u@@ ket was reported in the morning a bomb explosion .
&quot; during the det@@ onation close to the seaside resort of Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured after police information . &quot;
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , killing a municipal cler@@ k . &quot;
&quot; according to the authorities in a bou@@ quet of flowers , the explosive device went into the air in front of the territory police . &quot;
&quot; finally , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ western coast and in Ch@@ um@@ phon at the south @-@ eastern coast called for several injuries . &quot;
&quot; from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was said . &quot;
&quot; the bomb attacks bear the same hand@@ writing , &quot; said General Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ z@@ av@@ ee Free day to journalists . &quot;
we assume that it is a coordinated attack .
&quot; it is too early to express themselves about possible motives , but probably it is about the actions of Muslim rebels . &quot;
Thai media also wanted to see a sample typical of the bombing of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
&quot; the Thai police , on the other hand , stated that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist uprising or with international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local sab@@ otage which is limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot;
&quot; rather , it is assumed that the bombs were put on by opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , the authorities have received secret clu@@ es on upcoming events in the south of the country - however , they were not informed of the exact time and places . &quot;
still unclear which group is behind the attacks .
&quot; the police ordered their officials throughout the country to strengthen security around important government buildings as well as airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand , there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but mostly they do not address tourists . &quot;
Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace used by Thailand &apos;s King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; according to the well @-@ known bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Foreign Office recommends to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities . &quot;
&quot; high security risk ( level 3 ) applies to the provinces Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings . &quot;
&quot; after confron@@ tations between security forces and Muslim populations , no necessary journeys are taken into these provinces . &quot;
increased security risk ( Level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday occurred a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution dra@@ fted by the military jun@@ ta .
this grants the military considerable influence over the years to come .
&quot; jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country is moving towards stability , an improvement in the economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military un@@ ta , who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , will help themselves to restore the Kingdom to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the rebel@@ li@@ ous rebels in the extreme south of the country for years . &quot;
more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
&quot; just a year ago , 20 people were killed in Bangkok at a popular Hind@@ u shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists . &quot;
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t stop of the recent history of the country .
the right &quot; Identi@@ ty movement &quot; has come into sight of the Federal Office for constitutional protection .
&quot; according to several national offices , the conserv@@ ation@@ alists in the Con@@ federation have also put the group under observation . &quot;
&quot; in the &apos; Identi@@ t@@ arian Movement &apos; we see evidence of efforts against the liberal democratic basic order , &quot; &quot; said constitutional chief Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ aß of the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in this way , immigrants from the Islamic faith or the Middle East are de@@ fam@@ ed in extrem@@ ist ways . &quot;
that is why we are now watching the movement .
&quot; the &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it turns against &quot; &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity through alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; constitutional actors in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thurin@@ gia - observe the &quot; Identi@@ t@@ ins &quot; already . &quot;
Ma@@ ate said that his authority was closely aligned with the regional offices during the decision .
&quot; groups such as the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; said the Constitutional Court . &quot;
&quot; in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with a you@@ thful voice , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
that would be Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not an embarrass@@ ing advertisement for one &apos;s own cause .
propaganda is meant to appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
&quot; last but not least , there have been reports from several federal states about contacts of the &quot; Identi@@ t@@ ären &quot; to Af@@ D politicians . &quot;
Ma@@ ate said that he had no knowledge .
&quot; for the constitutional protection , potential contacts of this species are only relevant from a certain point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the party - in this case - the Af@@ D - by certain persons , who are extrem@@ ist , change their direction and become so extrem@@ ist . &quot;
the decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this shall not be discern@@ able .
&quot; with a view of the significant increase in legitimate off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee camps , Ma@@ ate said that he would not speak of new right terrorism in this regard . &quot;
but we have seen in recent years that there can be right @-@ wing terrorism .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal Group .
&quot; it may well be that other right @-@ wing groups form groups or small groups that plan attacks against asylum seekers , against refugee homes or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives . &quot;
&quot; a nationwide or pan @-@ European control of right @-@ wing terrorism , however , is not recognizable . &quot;
the previous groups were created at the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; worried about the fact that many ass@@ aults came to the account of people , who had previously not appeared in the right scene . &quot;
this is wor@@ rying .
&quot; many of the susp@@ ects of attacks on asylum lod@@ gings had previously not been known as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or supporters of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; many people have thus committed crimes which had previously had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , which might have been politically in@@ different or elected for example , CD@@ U , SPD or Left , which have , however , radic@@ alised by right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist mood . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
not always the Olympic Games or World Records determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the bold appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ its at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly overweight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia were so slow that he could not be seen in the TV pictures at times . &quot;
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was selected .
&quot; in social networks , Hab@@ sburg was subsequently added to the viral interaction . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished with a return of 48 seconds and finished the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters . &quot;
but it was rather his not just sporty character that attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian received a special start right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries known .
&quot; because in Ae@@ tho@@ ien most athletes run , Hab@@ ee just wanted to do something different . &quot;
preparation is everything : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ ake is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ names made the turn .
&quot; some media referred to him as &quot; &quot; ro@@ bel of the whale . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; referring to a &quot; &quot; prosperity b@@ ump &quot; , &quot; the English tab@@ loid &quot; The Sun &quot; with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; made fun of him . &quot;
&quot; his time , he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds about the 100 m fre@@ estyle , played no role . &quot;
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
&quot; during the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i took care of media attention . &quot;
&quot; unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to ride alone in a pre @-@ run over 100 meters of fre@@ estyle . &quot;
&quot; fr@@ en@@ e@@ tically , M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired back then . &quot;
the then 22 @-@ year @-@ old studied only eight months before Olympia and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .

Ger@@ ets@@ ried - The owner of a shop on the Neue Platz has been charged .
&quot; according to the police , the 67 @-@ year @-@ old Ger@@ ets@@ rie@@ der@@ in left their shop on Monday at 5.@@ 30@@ pm and forgot to close a window on the ground floor . &quot;

Tru@@ mp does not see the im@@ pending election defeat so tight
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp talks on an election campaign in Florida .
&quot; should there be nothing with the election to the US president , Donald Tru@@ mp already has an alternative video . &quot;
he will then go on holiday .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp loses the US presidential election in November , it doesn &apos;t matter : &quot; ultimately it will either work , or I have a very , very nice , long holiday , &quot; said the Republi@@ can candidate in a telephone interview with the U.S. television station CN@@ BC . &quot;
&quot; if it wasn &apos;t enough for him for political correctness in the end , then Tru@@ mp said . &quot;
&quot; he called the US President Barack Obama and the Democrats of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist militia Islamic State ( IS ) . &quot;
&quot; within its party , more and more resistance formed . &quot;
post goes into trading with electric @-@ transpor@@ ters
an electric delivery vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies on the vehicle is apparently great .
the post is planning to sell her electric vehicle stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter .
&quot; in the near future , the Group wants to start trading with the transpor@@ ter . &quot;
the post office wants to offer its electric vehicles from the coming year also on the free car market .
&quot; we want to enter the sale to third parties , &quot; &quot; said a post @-@ speaker on Friday . &quot;
&quot; for months the company has been testing whether or not they want to sell their own developed Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter , with which letters and pack@@ ets are to be sold to other companies . &quot;
&quot; post @-@ President Jürgen Ger@@ des had said that there are always questions , such as professional tra@@ des@@ men . &quot;
&quot; according to the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel , &quot; the Bonn Group will shortly enter into mass production of the vehicles . &quot;
&quot; in the post @-@ factory fabrication company , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and layer . &quot;
&quot; Ger@@ des announced that the Group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and , in the long run , made a complete change@@ over to environmentally friendly vehicles . &quot;
&quot; we will make a very , very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot;
I can imagine that we change the entire fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter has been active on Germany &apos;s roads since 2014 .
Gf@@ K leadership steps down after dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures
the Gf@@ K Consumer Research Centre exchanges its boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the tail@@ backs came suddenly - but not quite surprising .
&quot; the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K warned that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann becomes even more uncertain , the longer the successes promised by him . &quot;
&quot; turbul@@ ence at the head of the Nuremberg market research company Gf@@ K : after re@@ ap@@ pointing business figures and the res@@ ignation of the company leadership , the global number Five of the industry is facing a new beginning . &quot;
the Chief Executive Officer wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
&quot; the Chairman of the Supervisory Board , Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert , already dischar@@ ges from the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September . &quot;
&quot; as early as 1 September , the management board of the Executive Board will take up the current board member Gerhard Haus@@ jer@@ inger , divided the company . &quot;
&quot; he shall officially assume the position of a &quot; Executive Officer , &quot; until a successor to Hart@@ mann was found . &quot;
&quot; as a reason for the return , the company called &quot; different views &quot; towards long @-@ term business policy orientation . &quot;
details did not want to mention a spokes@@ man on Friday .
&quot; in the future , who will be conducting the market research company , is still unclear at this time . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , in the shareholders &apos; circles , the disappointment of the continued successes of the restructuring measures introduced years ago had been great . &quot;
&quot; since 2011 , Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K peak . &quot;
&quot; the fruits of restructuring , however , are not yet to be seen after 5 years , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in view of the recent bad Gf@@ K business , each shareholder becomes rest@@ less at some point . &quot;
&quot; if that were the case at BMW , this would also make the qu@@ and@@ ts like that . &quot; &quot;
&quot; following set@@ backs in the preceding quarters , the company could not stop its loss of losses in the second quarter of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; at € 36@@ 1.2 million , sales fell by 6.1 percent below the comparable level of the previous year . &quot;
&quot; in terms of the first half @-@ year , sales of 7@@ 2@@ 1.2 million euros shr@@ ank by 3.4 percent . &quot;
profit in the second quarter mainly imp@@ acted the lower value of the company in view of its difficult economic situation .

accidents - Bus sli@@ ps in Kru@@ mm@@ hör@@ n in Gr@@ aben : eight wounded
&quot; in an accident of a coach of 43 elderly passengers , eight people were injured on Thursday in Kru@@ mm@@ hör@@ n ( district of Aur@@ ich ) . &quot;
&quot; two of the in@@ mates suffered severe injuries , divided the police . &quot;
&quot; the 66 @-@ year @-@ old coach of the coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , according to her statements , had to ev@@ ade an opposite vice , who drove partly on the reverse track . &quot;
the bus came down to the right and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch as a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; due to the location of the bus , the persons could not leave the bus independently , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade released the in@@ mates .
six ambul@@ ances and a ambul@@ ance van came to the accident scene at the provincial road 2 .
the un@@ injured travellers were brought back from a regular bus to the Kru@@ mm@@ hör@@ ner district of P@@ ew@@ sum .
&quot; there , they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company . &quot;
the investig@@ ators called on the truck driver and possible witnesses to sign up with the police .
&quot; as of October 1st , 2016 , the fees per cubic meter of sewage amounts to the area of the san@@ itation plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch 3,@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 euros ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ per 3.@@ 36 Euro ( until now 2.@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ ore 3.@@ 64 Euro ( until now 2.@@ 18 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at the facility in Az@@ endorf , the wastewater fee will increase at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary . &quot;
&quot; after a high @-@ quality calculation , the se@@ wer rate in Az@@ ore will then reach 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter . &quot;
&quot; as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , in the approval of the budget by the District Council Kul@@ mb@@ ach , it was established that under@@ covers for these wastewater facilities were running . &quot;
&quot; due to legal bases , the market of Kas@@ endorf is obliged to operate the systems with cost @-@ covering . &quot;
&quot; as of October 1 , 2016 , citizens and industrial companies from Wel@@ sh , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ ez , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to go deeper into the pur@@ se . &quot;
the fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as Managing Director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the Board , a new calculation of the fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary . &quot;
&quot; in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - and under@@ covers from the previous calculation period may also be compensated . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt founded the serious fee increases with the fact that all three sewage plants handle relatively small facilities with a very low waste water fall , which flows between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; as a result of the low distribution of distribution , expenses for necessary repairs would have a serious impact on several thousand euros . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; furthermore , due to their age refurb@@ ishment and repair expenses , in the back @-@ lying calculation period , not least due to their age refurb@@ ishment and repair expenses were incurred to a considerable extent . &quot;
&quot; the facility in Az@@ ore is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ sh , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ ez almost 20 years . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt noted that in the Az@@ endorf sewage plant , the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced by a damage . &quot;
&quot; after nearly 20 years of operation , the first sewage slu@@ dge had to be excav@@ ated , the sewage slu@@ dge dispos@@ ed of and an additional ventilation facility had to be installed in order to meet the water legal requirements in the future . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt : &quot; these extraordinary expenses came into account with the continued assistance and maintenance costs , which must be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot;
&quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which are still clearly below the current level during the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 . &quot;
stone houses made it clear that in the three plants the cost of operation and maintenance in the three facilities was fully operational .
&quot; in the past 20 years , Schmidt , the market congregation of large entertainment costs , has been spar@@ ed in the se@@ wer systems in the past 20 years . &quot;
&quot; in the view of stone houses , the situation for the aforementioned plants will remain prec@@ arious in the long term , especially since the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ ach@@ tal Se@@ aling Association could not be extended because it is a lack of facilities . &quot;
Bulgaria registers inflation for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year when positive 0.2 % were posted .
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared with the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
&quot; the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation amounted to 1.0 % . &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
&quot; in July 2016 , a price increase in the following groups of consumer goods was observed in comparison with the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1,7 % ) ; transport ( 1,8 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1,2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices fell in clothing and shoes ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0,1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices remained as in the pre @-@ month of alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; and education unchanged . &quot;
snapshot &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect critic@@ ised as Asian carto@@ onist
&quot; snap@@ chat states that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say it is un@@ aware of races . &quot;
&quot; with its filtering tool , snap@@ shots enable about 150 million everyday users to change the reality and play identi@@ ties in such a way that borders on the absurd . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting . &quot;
&quot; the filters are non @-@ blo@@ ated , proprietary rotary tools that produce more than 30 million enhanced sel@@ fies per day . &quot;
all the mistakes are made to the public .
&quot; in the past , snap@@ chat filters have been critici@@ zed in the past where they were accused of using the app Black@@ face promoted or white skin as beauty ideal . &quot;
&quot; when this week a few users suggested a filter that gave them sli@@ t eyes , false teeth and blo@@ ated che@@ eks , some critics called it a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; &quot; yel@@ low@@ ish @-@ face . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they asked themselves if this repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a greater problem that the company has a diversity of diversity .
&quot; the news and ou@@ trage were widely distributed on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mot@@ her@@ board , one day after Snap@@ chat announced that it had turned off the feature . &quot;
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was intended to tribute to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
&quot; but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced racism , the filter reminded of inj@@ uri@@ ous c@@ lich@@ és . &quot;
others rejected the anim@@ e @-@ comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose tweet about the photos became widespread , that the filter was &quot; vulnerable &quot; and said to the least unpleasant . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very contradictory Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and filter effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not backed @-@ up , but that the yellow @-@ face was drawn into the thro@@ at@@ y extreme . &quot;
snapshot is not the only company that crosses this cultural stum@@ bling block .
&quot; American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and devices that we all hold in hand . &quot;
and snap@@ shots large audience of young people - who are different in race di@@ vers@@ ers than their older opponents - could tend to expect sensitivity .
&quot; if one of the snap@@ shots creates a picture that is offensive to a user , &quot; &quot; it is much more difficult that such things stay un@@ noticed than it was in the past , &quot; &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who worked as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete her Snap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same . &quot;
she said in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview she said that rapid @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the settings practices of snap@@ chat .
&quot; Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the large number of white , only male leaders and ended their essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either they have no representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; said the Chinese Z@@ hu , &quot; &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say what to do about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint that the snap@@ chat has largely un@@ answered . &quot;
the company does not publish numbers for the diversity of its staff and points to its status as a private company .
&quot; on Thursday , it refused to discuss the cultural background of his staff , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently set up a HR officer focusing on sub @-@ represented ethnic groups and internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu also said that she will close her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; military leadership fal@@ si@@ fies IS@@ IS intelligence , re@@ acts Committee of Congress &quot;
&quot; military personnel of the United States Central Command have changed intelligence intelligence in order to draw an optimistic view of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , as it allowed the actual conditions on the ground to report an investigation committee of the Congress in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the provisional report created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can Members of the Committee of Defense , Secret Service Committ@@ ees and the Military Vehic@@ le Committee reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Intelligence analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; central Command , shortly Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; intelligence service , typically ev@@ oked by high @-@ ranking Cent@@ Com com@@ man@@ ders , posted a positive image of the American efforts against terrorism when it allowed the actual conditions on site and were more positive than analysis of other intelligence services , &quot; a newspaper article cited the report . &quot;
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; said Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot;
the management errors in the Cent@@ Com range to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American strains in the training of Iraqi forces .
&quot; although there are no direct indications that government tips have given statements under Obama to change reports , it shows how analysts were exposed to pressure from their superi@@ ors to draw an optimistic view of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements before the Congress were much more positive than the facts &quot; provided the report . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ Com affiliate publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ es could begin in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ su@@ l , second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigation , it &apos;s so clear . &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ sman from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , Central Command &apos;s leaders changed intelligence reports to reduce the danger of IS@@ IS in Iraq . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans called the Task Force in life after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings while the investigations continue .
&quot; in addition , further investigations of Cent@@ Com are underway by the Chief In@@ spec@@ tor of the Department of Defense . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , democratic members of the Intelligence Committee released their own findings , which coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 Cent@@ Com created an over@@ ly restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and Iraqi security services , &quot; announced the highest @-@ level Dem@@ ok@@ rat in the committee , member of the Adam B. Shi@@ p House of Represent@@ atives , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; this process , Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; sh@@ amed the mor@@ als under analysts and &quot; gave too little room for dis@@ sent@@ ing opinions . &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no indication of any intervention of the White House at the Cent@@ Com analysts with regard to a &quot; specific political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the Congress &apos;s investigations were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon General inspec@@ tor , who received complaints from Cent@@ Com analysts . &quot;
&quot; C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the Congress , while the In@@ spec@@ tor &apos;s investigations are still underway . &quot;
&quot; but he also admitted that &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ ging opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot; &quot;
the investigations have further effects on the question of a successful air campaign under US leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
&quot; however , the alleg@@ ations of the previous year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State reminds of differences of more than ten years ago when a Cent@@ com Analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a piece about how the then government under George W. Bush fores@@ aw only a small occupying troops in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the 2003 invasion . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting of the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team headed by Mr. Hoo@@ ker determines government officials that contrary to the statements made by the government , air strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State have no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , since these temporary refin@@ eries have been put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; this recognition , however , was not published , the Times reported in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger Command , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critici@@ zed by members of the legislature for his excessive positive assessment of the situation at a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
general Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel at Central Command .
&quot; the USA gains fourth match in the field hockey of women , a show@@ down with Great Britain stands before &quot;
&quot; one day after having shot three goals during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ck team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five goals in two games should actually be a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she couldn &apos;t remember that ever done . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to the people who remember their goals .
&quot; however , they know : the Americans are at the Olympic competition at 4 @-@ 0 and they are equal in their group with the Brit@@ ons in the first place , which after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan remain un@@ defeated . &quot;
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams . &quot;
the first place will take the strong Dutch woman slightly longer from the path that the other group will lead .
&quot; as always the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising turbul@@ ence by their success story , four years after they landed in the past London games on the last of 12 places . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a hockey ra@@ cket in hands ( her two older sisters played sports at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became the national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
she missed the 2008 Olympics because she couldn &apos;t qualify for the cabin .
then came the year 2012 when everything went wrong for her and her team .
&quot; in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , became the coach of the National Team and thus began to turn things to a better . &quot;
&quot; a change of culture , mental change and physical change , &quot; B@@ am said . &quot;
we didn &apos;t have the work@@ station in London that we now have .
we have been able to ro@@ b the ru@@ dder completely .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the door in the first half of the game with a back@@ stroke from the near area .
&quot; India had gone into the game without a win in the tournament , but the team showed itself surprisingly tough and held the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands . &quot;
&quot; she performed a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved to the center and kno@@ cked the ball into the gate to get the American female a 2 @-@ 0 lead . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had previously had to book a goal in each of the previous games . &quot;
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , as late as it is , it is the Olympics . &quot;
&quot; Rio de Janeiro &apos;s events feel constant and inevitable , a ra@@ ging relay between competition and aspir@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod , which is passed from the w@@ rist@@ watch to the s@@ wimm@@ ers to the tri@@ ath@@ lete . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t turn off the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor &apos;s conversation in the store , without hearing about Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s black with dimples , could well have been built among these familiar names , which would be sent to Prime Time by sponsors and well @-@ being TV ads when he would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gymn@@ asts or even fen@@ cers . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights at Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines around gold . &quot;
the Olympic flame does not immediately illumin@@ ate every event .
&quot; further from the centre , partly in the shadow are the sports that are not generally accepted : air pist@@ ol shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the breast @-@ swim and may it reign for a long time .
&quot; but if I should make more modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline . &quot;
&quot; although the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , it was so spar@@ sely perceived the last 16 years that many of them that I had asked didn &apos;t know that it was an Olympic sport altogether . &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the USA sent athletes for competition , it has never won a medal in trampoline jumping and had an ath@@ lete until 2012 who made it to the final round . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadi@@ ans for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
&quot; jumping on the trampoline has some exterior char@@ me , partly because it sounds more suitable for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school than those for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point I should admit , that I am not an expert , but just an earth bound enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has humor@@ istic potential - the carto@@ on@@ ish trem@@ bling of his never @-@ ending impact , but also the grace of gymn@@ as@@ tics and diving , the two sports which essentially unite . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline which means &quot; spring@@ board . &quot; &quot;
&quot; emerging conqu@@ er@@ ors jump on a giant trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a series of falling movements ( turning , pi@@ ke and sal@@ tos ) before they land on their feet . &quot;
&quot; according to the official Olympic programme , they are rated according to performance , difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio . &quot;
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
&quot; med@@ alists have to go further , faster , up and down in their quest for gold , sometimes up to the goal , sometimes up and down , up and down at the playground . &quot;
&quot; they hunt not only the finish line or the pre@@ text , but also another highlight in television coverage : the world or the Olympi@@ ap@@ et . &quot;
&quot; the goal @-@ oriented aspir@@ ation is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ ati@@ cal - and it is enough to even stir a spect@@ ator to tears . &quot;
but it is also what I feel ti@@ res@@ ome when watching these games .
the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she stops , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ lessly like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down@@ wards , then effort@@ lessly back up . &quot;
&quot; here too there is competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant suspension of time and gravity . &quot;
it is so Zen as the competition can only be at the Olympics .
&quot; the qualification and final rounds of the women will be held on Friday afternoon , in the stream at 13@@ .00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13@@ .00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final accounts as part of a mid @-@ afternoon block on both days from 14@@ .00 .
&quot; in the heart of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably overlooked in the general tur@@ mo@@ il . &quot;
&quot; when the increasing awareness of consciousness can only be achieved through the an@@ x@@ ie@@ ties and the objectiv@@ ity of male athletes - as the male U.S. gymn@@ asts recently proposed to the Wall Street Journal , Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey anticip@@ ates his new fan base . &quot;
&quot; a generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the USA &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators calling for political changes in Ethiopia clas@@ hed with government violent resistance .
witnesses say that dozens of prot@@ esters were killed during clas@@ hes with the police during shot changes .
is Ethiopia just going to collapse ?
&quot; in the last ten years , it was one of Africa &apos;s most stable countries , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy . &quot;
&quot; but in recent months , protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and expanded into more and more areas . &quot;
last week thousands of people stor@@ med the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
&quot; according to human rights organizations , the government &apos;s response was rel@@ ent@@ less . &quot;
witnesses stated that polic@@ emen shot and killed in dozens of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; the videos being circul@@ ating about the protests , which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year , show how security professionals strike young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a hand@@ stand against a wall . &quot;
the head of the UN authority for human rights now demands a detailed investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa , the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
&quot; American military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiop@@ ians to combat terror attacks across the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western aid . &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a resp@@ ectable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
&quot; the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been limited , with dissi@@ dents effective silence . &quot;
&quot; many were sent into exile or in prison , killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; if you op@@ press people and do not have any other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in central e@@ thiop@@ ia . &quot;
the entire youth protests .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous ail@@ ments covering everything from land use to stran@@ gle@@ hold regarding power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; following a widely critic@@ ised election last year , the ruling party and its allies got the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 per cent of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , tensions continue along the Er@@ it@@ rea border ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June . &quot;
&quot; analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o @-@ Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ ga@@ den , which were more or less forced in recent years , could exploit the turbul@@ ence and be able to arm themselves again . &quot;
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess after years of thinking under the surface are now explo@@ ding .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
&quot; only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate with the social media , as cheaper smartphones have become more and more frequent and the internet services improved . &quot;
&quot; even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do at regular intervals , especially at protests , many people can still communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians gave up that they were so close together .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ ms and Am@@ har@@ as , the two biggest ethnic groups in Ethiopia . &quot;
the Oro@@ sei and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; for e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Ethiopia predominantly Christian high@@ lands , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy , while they exploited the Oro@@ mos , many of which are Muslims and live in low@@ land areas . &quot;
but this is also changing .
&quot; we are to co @-@ ordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ atu Mi@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ sei . &quot;
the biggest protests took place in areas of the Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ sei .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is un@@ fairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray who constitute about 6 per cent of the population and dominant in the military , secret services , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was the prime minister of Ethiopia until his death in 2012 for 17 years . &quot;
&quot; he was considered a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think about corners . &quot;
analysts say that he was especially vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; the current regime lacks this basic skill , &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiopia &apos;s new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively in@@ scrut@@ able reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the South . &quot;
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services monitored by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time Ethiopia experienced such a tur@@ mo@@ il in 2005 , after thousands protest against elections , apparently sli@@ pped by the government , and subsequently stolen . &quot;
&quot; during the ensu@@ ing ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed even if they were less than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , as well as for their meas@@ urable progress in fighting poverty . &quot;
but obviously this has not prevented the intensi@@ fication of the Ethiop@@ ian government &apos;s internal ab@@ norm@@ ality .
and it assumes a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; last month prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ pers@@ one city , led by Tig@@ ray , and the hatred of the Tig@@ ray is becoming more common in the social media . &quot;
analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flug over neighboring Somalia , even if it recently shared that it has closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le region . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; is a very thin ti@@ ght@@ rope walk . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp explains his asser@@ tion Obama had founded IS@@ IS was &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m . &quot;
&quot; Donald J. Tru@@ mp tried to dissi@@ p@@ ate the last controversy surrounding his campaign , fear@@ ing that his repeated asser@@ tion , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton would be the &quot; founders &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not serious . &quot;
&quot; this clari@@ fication raised new questions about the communication skills of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate , whether he was able to communicate clearly and understand@@ ably to the American public . &quot;
&quot; it also brings along its comrades who endeav@@ our to take protection during an event@@ ful period , into the peculiar position of explaining statements that he could not have meant . &quot;
&quot; having made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tru@@ mp drew back with reference to the alleg@@ ation on Thursday , and insi@@ sted in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp said he was sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ we@@ et was contrary to the previous day when Mr. Tru@@ mp said in a series of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation was completely serious . &quot;
&quot; when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tru@@ mp wanted to help him weak@@ en the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate did not want to know anything about it . &quot;
&quot; the last storm of criticism per@@ v@@ ades Mr. Tru@@ mp , trying to direct the focus of his campaign due to falling demand values on the economic situation . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Mich@@ igan this week .
&quot; on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp tried to return to this topic again . &quot;
&quot; using Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her talk boring . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp has already advanced sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
&quot; at the end of July , he critic@@ ised himself when he thought that the Russians should h@@ ack Clinton &apos;s emails but later on &quot; Of course , &quot; I said , &quot; Of course , I thought the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot; &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tru@@ mp to post@@ p@@ one linguistic boundaries in politics and then back to demand .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans , how they arrive , and then possibly &quot; clarify &quot; depending on how the reaction fails . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who monitors the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I also believe that he is clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough , so that they can be interpreted in different ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tru@@ mp has assumed an even more et@@ ched tone as his survey values have gone further . &quot;
&quot; a new survey by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a leading lead in North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tru@@ mp is generally trying not to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his humour . &quot;
&quot; but as he emphas@@ ises in the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s Scher@@ ze brought his loy@@ alist comrades into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s most prominent advoc@@ ates , made great efforts to defend the candidate in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani told him about the correctness of Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s statements asked if Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that before Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them back@@ ers , completely false , and that is why it happened because he drew the troops out of Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most mainstream re@@ public@@ ans are trying to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State , allowed IS@@ IS to spread the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively under control . &quot;
&quot; before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp continued his attacks on the media and accused them of going around on each of his words and being prejudi@@ ced against him . &quot;
&quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the poor , mis@@ erable &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; You can &apos;t ! . &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats mo@@ cked for Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s ap@@ ology than just another proof that he was un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
&quot; once pushed over the price of the market , Café in Green@@ point returns &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a cre@@ amy café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could pay only cash , which was not a Wi @-@ Fi but served with good coffee for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; of course , prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue store were displaced . &quot;
&quot; So@@ ap Cher@@ ie shop , replacing the verb in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes . &quot;
native inhabitants inv@@ aded it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is changing , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel is excluding and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
&quot; but if New York is a change , then it &apos;s also a re @-@ invention . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ vit@@ alized ver@@ b cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ time employee of the old cafe , the owner and managing director of the new cafe . &quot;
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
&quot; when a customer offered to provide money for a new out@@ post , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot . &quot;
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
&quot; on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese , and there are gar@@ n@@ ishments such as cap@@ ers and s@@ aut@@ é@@ ed onions . &quot;
there are natural circuit keys .
&quot; the café does not serve any beer , but there are fresh juices . &quot;
after nine months Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; many old customers were also displaced by prices from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; recently on a Sunday , Rebe@@ cca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer . &quot;
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg in the past and regularly visited the club . &quot;
&quot; even after she had moved to Green@@ point , she would take the road . &quot;
&quot; after the verb closed , she gave up the coffee table for a while , she said . &quot;
&quot; it was clear to me that it was the coffee and culture in the verb that I liked , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now she drinks coffee again , even if she ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i tea on that day instead of her usual iced coffee , which is another new addition . &quot;
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long @-@ standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the club in 2003 .
he went there before the work and in@@ vari@@ ably ordered the same .
&quot; I came to a quarter after seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
&quot; nowadays Ros@@ enthal always gets his usual order , but sometimes he altern@@ ates his Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had no res@@ ent@@ ment that the soap business took the old business space .
&quot; in fact , the owner of So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered to make a special soap for verb@@ s with the coffee of coffee in the café as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go into their offer , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional Polish inhabitants , Green@@ points , have also accepted the café . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he proposed to exhibit it soon , so that his new neighbors feel welcome . &quot;
the location also has further advantages .
a local juice shop wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ baked coffee in bottles .
there is a chance that the café is expanding onto a neighbouring building .
&quot; for many customers , a new verb is enough to get their old favor@@ ites . &quot;
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed on the ground when the cafe closed .
&quot; when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and the burial felt a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a plentiful meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his climb to the President , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roosev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
&quot; as a gourmet , President Roosev@@ elt had a passion for refined delic@@ at@@ essen of Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water tur@@ tle soup . &quot;
&quot; his menu on that day was a little more modest : stu@@ ffed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes , and dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; said Jane Ziegel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; There was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
&quot; the last book &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; was from Chinese cuisine in the U.S. while Ziegel@@ man told in her book &quot; &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; &quot; about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from the food perspective . &quot;
&quot; her latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a re@@ porter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , snow@@ y snack at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; Ziegel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate . &quot;
&quot; when the re@@ porter had ordered min@@ ced meat , this was the pair for a discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; there was pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread . &quot;
&quot; they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper , that the ingredient is stretched . &quot;
imagine so many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ ins .
&quot; it has to be in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet . &quot;
&quot; men of women cooked for male ri@@ ms and it was served freshly baked p@@ ate for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the first World War . &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; hon@@ ours the ways with which the country is surrounded by no longer the land of shame . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when food for Americans became a central , ten@@ se theme , &quot; &quot; explained Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; the new budget was equally ten@@ se : mysterious meals , such as bread and c@@ asser@@ ole , became stap@@ le foods that recovered c@@ asser@@ ole as &quot; wonderful species , lef@@ to@@ ver food lef@@ to@@ vers , &quot; found Ziegel@@ man , as coo@@ ks could hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit .
&quot; meat , which was the center of American cuisine for years , became a rare luxury . &quot;
&quot; peculiar mixes have been tried out , as a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nutri@@ tious satisfaction has preced@@ ence over taste or even healthy cuisine . &quot;
&quot; during her research for the book , which also includes recipes , Ziegel@@ man prepared a dish from that era , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter . &quot;
&quot; it was no popular additive at lun@@ ch@@ time , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; Ziegel@@ man continues : &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not match each other .
it was typical for many of the home recipes .
&quot; like never before or ever since , budget econom@@ ists - including Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - were the country &apos;s eating habits . &quot;
&quot; by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; &quot; house@@ keepers &quot; &quot; and the challenge of converting P@@ amp@@ e as cre@@ amy sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ rots into delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a celebration of historical delicacies .
&quot; in particular , the reports of the government response to star@@ ving citizens are particularly tasty , as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s L@@ ass @-@ cake @-@ food attitude . &quot;
&quot; while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa peasant &apos;s cuisine of his kitchen , he spoke as the million @-@ million man of the world he has become . &quot;
&quot; he liked continental cuisine such as fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
he ate in an almost golden dining room and wore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was truly alien to reality .
President Roosev@@ elt might have committed the same mistake if his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to make an example with his stomach .
&quot; as described in the book , the how@@ ling of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors by Ms Roosev@@ elt said that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most controversial . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of Great Depression , dealing with food , was rejected as soon as the country returned to its legs . &quot;
&quot; the legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food , said Ziegel@@ man , as well as on how science was applied to food . &quot;
the couple gave better understanding of the eating habits of the mother in law when writing the book - for example how they could not throw away food .
&quot; she had a real fear of food waste , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man remembered , &quot; &quot; She actually made people sick . &quot;
there was the av@@ alan@@ che incident .
&quot; after the plates were cleared at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e brought out a dessert that they had made at home : the pl@@ um dessert , the president Roosev@@ elt ate at lunch . &quot;
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man said , adding that it was a bad trick to miss a modest recipe , modest recipes . &quot;
&quot; there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
&quot; everyone di@@ pped something reluct@@ antly a spoon in the teeth , brown gli@@ b@@ bers . &quot;
&quot; amaz@@ ingly , it was not bad . &quot;
Co@@ E took three times a set@@ back .
&quot; like a Can @-@ do bud@@ ge@@ erer , he said to his wife , &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
killed by bomb attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar devoted his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
&quot; now , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old died on a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; O@@ mar was a member of &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil protection group that saved almost 60,000 people alive according to Bild @-@ Zeitung . &quot;
29@@ 00 volunteers play their own lives in order to attract people from bom@@ bed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the face of the group : a video of the civilians who showed him during an 11 hour rescue of a baby from the rub@@ ble of a house went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians a shining symbol figure in the horror of the war .
&quot; but he never saw himself as heroes , said according to the picture : &quot; for me , this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when I die , I think God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot;
&quot; shortly before O@@ mar himself attacked an attack on the victim , he spoke in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the helicop@@ ters have dropped four barrel bombs over the Al@@ z@@ adi@@ a district , one filled with chl@@ oric gas . &quot;
&quot; a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath . &quot;
&quot; we now eradic@@ ate the po@@ ison@@ ous rem@@ nants of the bomb , lest children play with it , &quot; &quot; the picture quotes his last words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Greenland shar@@ k : the oldest verteb@@ rate is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland sh@@ arks usually come to the surface only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research vessel S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie only gets offspring with 150 years .
&quot; lei@@ surely , the Greenland @-@ shar@@ k flo@@ ats along the North Atlantic coast , in an hour it reaches an average of just 1,@@ 220 meters . &quot;
&quot; only when it matters , the five meter long animal acceler@@ ates to a full 2.@@ 6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed . &quot;
&quot; this lifestyle , co@@ ined by slow@@ ness , seems to be a prescription for a high age . &quot;
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at least from a Greenland @-@ shar@@ k who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; mad , &quot; said Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein from the Max Planck Institute for Dem@@ ographic Research in Rostock this life @-@ span , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot;
&quot; although the evolution bi@@ ologist suspected long , that Greenland sh@@ arks are stone @-@ old . &quot;
only the evidence was missing .
&quot; Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks are difficult to observe , and finally they live mainly in the Ice Sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Spitz@@ bergen . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures of 6 degrees Celsius , they usually appear on the surface only in winter . &quot;
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks .
their slow @-@ pent@@ ag@@ ine measure it when they with@@ held six animals in front of S@@ val@@ bard with a transmitter .
&quot; in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear . &quot;
possibly they hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rol on the bottom of the iron and look for car@@ c@@ asses leading from higher water @-@ layers down tor@@ ches .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks which caught fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depths of the North Atlantic .
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long , while the largest 50@@ 2 centimet@@ re measured . &quot;
&quot; in order to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the l@@ enti@@ cular core of sh@@ arks with the carbon @-@ 14 method . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eye lens arises already before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained therein are no longer renewed . &quot;
the two smallest sh@@ arks had notably plenty of carbon @-@ 14 in the lens kernel .
&quot; its birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s , as a nuclear weapon attempt to allevi@@ ate large quantities of this radio@@ active carbon in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; the l@@ enti@@ cular nucleus , on the other hand , contained a small excess of carbon @-@ 14 out of the atomic weapons in the third @-@ smallest animal with 220 centimet@@ ers . it was therefore likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , all the larger Greenland sh@@ arks had normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities in their l@@ enti@@ cular nucleus , resulting from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock showed an age of 3@@ 35 years for a 4@@ 93 cm long Greenland shar@@ k , while the record shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers was even 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; that Greenland @-@ shar@@ k @-@ females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known . &quot;
now the researchers were able to classi@@ fy the length of an age .
&quot; since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ ers probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age with 156 years was determined , Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks with the multip@@ lication evi@@ dently permit at least one and a half centuries of time . &quot;
this is also likely to be world record for verteb@@ rates .
the fact that such methane em@@ es live above all in icy waters is no coincidence .
&quot; also the old record holder , a 2@@ 11 years old Greenland @-@ whale , in whose bac@@ on at the neck stuck a 120 year old har@@ po@@ on tip , was caught in front of Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there is often running on a fl@@ aming flame . &quot;
so they mature later - and age slower .
&quot; in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals are often very large . &quot;
&quot; the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal loses heat . &quot;
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with one gram Elef@@ ant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal therefore lives more danger@@ ously and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as possible , &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , a very large animal should invest his resources in a long life . &quot;
building site in double pack
&quot; with topics relating to construction , the Municipal Council has focused on the most recent meeting . &quot;
&quot; with relief , the board accepted the release of Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of the recently proven residential areas can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; after clearing the land , par@@ cel@@ eration and development issues and sur@@ veying the applications for measurement , the sale of land plots in the residential areas &quot; &quot; Straß@@ l@@ weg &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; &quot; ( section 1 ) is nothing more in the way of interested parties . &quot;
the municipal council is convinced that the construction areas in the rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au appeal to young families and young sen@@ iors equally .
&quot; as it was said , building blocks can register immediately in the town hall . the municipal council is expected to advise on the allocation of the plots during its September meeting . &quot;
&quot; in order to make inquiries for the establishment of further commercial enterprises , connected with job creation , the Municipal Council decided to change the land plan newly created in the spring of this year in sub @-@ areas . &quot;
&quot; in the area of Unter@@ zeit@@ lar@@ n , the industrial area already designated there will be extended by two plots in the direction of state road 2@@ 112 . &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
&quot; therefore , the city of the Main has the best chances of attracting jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg . &quot;
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt benefits most from the Bre@@ x@@ it V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the competence field financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether money houses can continue to operate from London in financial transactions across the EU . &quot;
&quot; so far , the so @-@ called EU passport is sufficient for them in the UK . &quot;
that is why large US banks are using this .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
&quot; the lobby association &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Banking &quot; &quot; expects 10@@ 000 new jobs in the Main within five years . &quot;
&quot; for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which brings together responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the euro@@ zone , as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Authority ( E@@ IO@@ PA ) and the Risk Council ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but it is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; while Luxembourg is home to a large fund industry , it also deterior@@ ates as well as Dublin for infrastructure . &quot;
Frankfurt is significantly easier to reach thanks to the large airport .
&quot; furthermore , the city has easily available commercial properties . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , it &apos;s not that easy to find high @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Seine capacities for first @-@ class commercial real estate are 50 percent higher than the Main River . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition , thanks to good medical care and infrastructure , as well as less crime . &quot;
&quot; in a ranking of the management consultancy Mer@@ cer , the city ranks seventh in seventh place , Luxemburg on No. 19 , Dublin in place 33 and Paris in 3@@ 7th place . &quot;
&quot; even if quality of life is a matter of preferences : &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial centre for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract other banks and investors , &quot; &quot; concludes the I@@ W . &quot;

&quot; the balance of power : in London , around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry in accordance with figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba in the end of 2015 , in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2,500 . &quot;
Gilead gains legal costs from hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. magi@@ strate decided that Gilead Sciences Inc claims to reimbur@@ se the legal costs resulting from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
&quot; in June Gilead was released from a compensation payment of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster drug so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ of@@ i of Gilead stood after a U.S. judge uncovered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including the per@@ jur@@ ist and other un@@ ethical actions . &quot;
&quot; when the law@@ suit was raised on Thursday , U.S. Secretary Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman announced that Gilead is entitled to the reduction of costs incurred during the defence of the case . &quot;
Mer@@ ck tries to equ@@ alize with Gilead that controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
&quot; the case goes back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck acc@@ use each other and took ownership of laboratory work which included Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ ck Ac@@ t@@ ant@@ om@@ ag , an active ingredient in the medicines of Gilead . &quot;
troops supported by the United States say that they have reg@@ ained full control over Man@@ bi@@ j by the Islamic State
&quot; by the United States , troops supported the full control of the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters in the city left them , a spokes@@ man for the group said on Friday . &quot;
&quot; the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) are still comb@@ ing the rem@@ nants of the remaining group of fighters trapped inside the city , currently the city . &quot;
&quot; they freed more than 2,000 civilians who were held ho@@ stages by the fighters , Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish shared with the D@@ KS Man@@ bi@@ j Military Council Reu@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; the city is now under perfect control , but we are carrying out clearing @-@ up jobs , &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot;
Clin@@ tons earn 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton released its tax return for 2015 on Friday , which resulted in a USD 10.@@ 75 million in@@ comes and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % for the Democrats and her husband . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , Clinton &apos;s US dollars donated USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former Foreign Minister Bill Clinton delivered USD 3 million from Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster &apos;s publisher for her book on her term of office in the State Department . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s candidate for vice @-@ pres@@ idency , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published his tax declarations for the past ten years with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton . &quot;
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards regarding financial transparency , &quot; said Clinton &apos;s campaign assistant J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in a stark contrast , Donald Tru@@ mp hides behind false statements and re@@ trac@@ ts regarding his previous promises to publish his tax declarations . &quot;
&quot; it is customary for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations , although they are not obliged to do so by law . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp , a New York business@@ man and his lawyers have indicated a tax audit by tax authorities as a reason for his refusal . &quot;
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s campaign assistant Ian S@@ ams on Twitter , with regard to the publication of the Pres@@ idential candidate of the Democrats . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tru@@ mp@@ s Special Ad@@ visor , said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tru@@ mp to publish something before tax inspections are not completed . &quot;
&quot; among other things , Tru@@ mp@@ s critics , including the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal to raise questions regarding assets , donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business and various other connections , particularly with Russia . &quot;
&quot; Clinton had already pl@@ ung@@ ed into the subject and published a video on the internet on Friday , in which high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tru@@ mp asked to publish his tax declaration . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , she also talked about the topic during a speech on the business in Mich@@ igan . &quot;
&quot; he refuses to do what each other candidate has done in the last decades , and to publish his tax declarations . &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Politi@@ co reported that during the 1990s , Tru@@ mp has paid no or very little tax for two years , and an economic journalist of the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ors on Friday that this could still be the case . &quot;
&quot; in the election campaign , federal taxes have become an issue . &quot;
Clinton is supporting a scheme named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett who would make sure that people pay more than USD 1 million a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; during a campaign for H@@ illary Clinton last week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka , Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has its headquarters here , invited Tru@@ mp to a meeting to exchange their tax declarations . &quot;
Buff@@ ett said he was also subjected to a tax check of the I@@ RS and Tru@@ mp was afraid of the voters and not before tax authorities .
Clinton &apos;s campaign has released tax return by 2007 .
&quot; Clin@@ tons , now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an effective tax rate of about 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 40@@ 5 % . &quot;
&quot; the tax return of the Clinton of 2015 showed that they have only obtained USD 100 of their income as wages , unlike most Americans . &quot;
&quot; their main financial situation was a cost @-@ effective index fund , from which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and earnings of USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 were tax@@ ed . &quot;

&quot; con@@ doms with ili@@ pu@@ der , fire@@ work bodies promote Tanz@@ anian eleph@@ ants &quot;
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going inhabited by people inhabited by people - they throw con@@ doms on them filled with ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ ds .
&quot; the method has proven to be effective , and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , who already had the idea years ago , intensified its promotion together with the US nature protection by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania , using a non @-@ violent four @-@ stage method to protect their homes and crops without hur@@ ting animals . &quot;
&quot; previously , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves . &quot;
Friday is World Wide Day dedicated to animal protection .
&quot; since we have developed the ... tool@@ kit , we have been able to observe a change in attitudes within these communities , while they are much more confident that they can keep the eleph@@ ants off their fields without damaging the elephant &quot; , &quot; said the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message . &quot;
the first two steps include the illumination of the elephant with a torch and blowing into a horn .
&quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; chip cloud &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot;
&quot; ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , whose end is turned to the ignition cord . &quot;
&quot; when it is lit , the con@@ dom bur@@ sts with a b@@ ang and spra@@ ys fine dust to ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der into the air . &quot;
a touch right usually already out to ch@@ ase the elephant .
&quot; a last possibility is a th@@ row@@ er , who shoots a golf fire@@ works in the air and causes a loud , bright explosion . &quot;
city Council unanim@@ ously decides : no ki@@ osk construction on St. Go@@ ar@@ er Rhein@@ u@@ fer

&quot; however , the city council now unanim@@ ously rejected the application for the new construction of a sal@@ es@@ man on the Rhine river in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine river . &quot;
&quot; in principle , we welcome new businesses , but at this location in an exposed location on the banks of the Rhine , this ki@@ osk does not fit , &quot; stated Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U faction . &quot;
Jewish director dis@@ covers Berliner Hotel because Israeli pres@@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; invitation - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots le@@ aned a media watch after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli pres@@ election as it would have requested Arabic guests according to a staff .
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; issued his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin , writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the hotel &apos;s list of countries . &quot;
&quot; however , the country was not listed between the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel was eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i B@@ rist@@ ol offers a possibility to choose Israel through its own call centre . &quot;
&quot; searching for an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception . &quot;
&quot; the answer he got there , &quot; cho@@ ke him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the hotel staff said that the measure was an &quot; deliber@@ ate decision by the management of Kemp@@ inski hotels . &quot;
&quot; the reason behind it , triggered even more anger in the director . &quot;
&quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is deleted , &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann was quoted . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ blatt named it a &quot; big dis@@ grace , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were horri@@ fied by this event and dis@@ ma@@ yed .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even an even greater dis@@ grace .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
the incident triggered a fairly large response from the Internet where people called the whole thing a sc@@ andal .
some subordin@@ ate to the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that there had been &quot; re@@ for@@ estation of Arabian guests . &quot;
&quot; be ashamed , &quot; &quot; said it in another article , in which it was pointed out that the hotel , located on the clas@@ sy Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is near a synagogue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly referred to all alleg@@ ations of himself and called the incident a &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; to Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct directive &quot; &quot; to not include Israel in the quick @-@ election list , &quot; &quot; said the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung , a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
adds that the country code has now been added .
police deplo@@ ys tear gas and rubber floors against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
&quot; students met with the police on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo , when they gathered to protest against government reforms for the public education system . &quot;
the police attacked Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; the difficulties began when police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , resulting in police rub@@ bers and tear gas . &quot;
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation about the plans .
&quot; according to the Govern@@ ors of the Federal State of Sao Paulo Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are being implemented to save money . &quot;
some of the Protest@@ ants were seen gra@@ ff@@ iti against the provisional President Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
&quot; the recent protests have occurred several days after demonstr@@ ators went into the streets to support the suspended president Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been reli@@ eved of the office by a vote of the Senate . &quot;
trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; with the lifting of the sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trading revenue between Moscow and Teher@@ an rose by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent in the year . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions have been lifted against Iran , the interest in Russian enterprises has increased strongly in business in the country , the ambassador said . &quot;
Russian companies are taking up existing links with Iran while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; of course , the further commercial expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot;
it noted that the trading revenue between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 rose by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $ 8@@ 56 million .
&quot; in particular , Russian imports climbed by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the commercial up@@ swing was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot;
&quot; for this year , D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan is expecting a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia . &quot;
&quot; last year , the Russian foreign representation issued some 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , primarily travelling vis@@ as , Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries regarding the number of tourists in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , only a few Russians visit Iran , something that the ambassador hopes it will change . &quot;
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who have received the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition , &quot; he said . &quot;
testim@@ onials searched : beverage market covered in forest fires
a rob@@ ber@@ y event has been practi@@ sed on Thursday evening on the drink market of Re@@ we XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
&quot; under the au@@ d@@ acity of a fire@@ arm , three dark @-@ dressed people who had mu@@ stered their faces from the drink em@@ blem pushed the hand out of cash and then fled at first by foot and then presumably with a silver @-@ colored VW Golf . &quot;
&quot; how much money has been captured , the police does not share . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ators should have been between 1,@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 meters tall , thus relatively small . &quot;
the beverage market is directly accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market and is badly visible .
&quot; the perpetr@@ ators have to be scann@@ ed in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and fled from the gravel parking lot located opposite the park entrance with the silver @-@ colored car , possibly in the direction of B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) . &quot;
&quot; those who made observations at the time of the Tat@@ ars ( about 7.@@ 45 p.m. ) , which are related to the rob@@ ber@@ y attack , should urgently report to the police . &quot;
Nag@@ old : play and fun during summer free time
&quot; eight beautiful and joyful days spent the children and youth of the social educational day group / social group work of the child protection association Nag@@ old with their supervis@@ ors at their summer Friday in N@@ uss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er . &quot;
during the first school holiday in Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ zer the life @-@ joyful group was quartered during the first week of school holidays .
several full day trips were on the agenda .
&quot; on the one hand , it went to B@@ oth with the visit to the string zoo . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guide in the world @-@ famous monastery . &quot;
the third excursion continued to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
&quot; in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about everyday life and the food of the Cel@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; on the hot days , the group stayed at the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invited for jumping , swimming and plan@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; culinary delights were offered to children and car@@ ers with their own prepared corpor@@ e@@ ors such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ Breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; workshops were stained , beautiful jewelry made of beads and stones or made of wood a Roman mill game . &quot;
&quot; further highlights of leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; Bun@@ te evening . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the day of his return home , the sun and the children and young people returned home . &quot;
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the gate of mercy
the ministers from the pastoral unit E@@ yach@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way to Freiburg on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
&quot; together , four stages were dealt with . &quot;
&quot; in order to bridge the time until the next Roman pilgrimage of all ministers in the last two years , the Pre @-@ minist@@ erial Round St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a long @-@ day pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; various pilgrimage destinations were examined and finally decided for the Epis@@ cop@@ al city of Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy with the opened gate of mercy on Freiburg Min@@ ster , a special pilgrimage destination was offered . &quot;
&quot; 16 Min@@ is from B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ol , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and Hei@@ ligen@@ zimmern , were on the way . &quot;
&quot; in the evening before , pastor Canc@@ el sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed pilgri@@ ma@@ ges and shared pilgri@@ ma@@ ges . &quot;
&quot; from Hor@@ b we drove by train to the starting point Vil@@ lingen , where also a Münster Un@@ ser@@ er loved woman stood and so the pilgrimage took place from the Mu@@ en@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; the individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening , each with a short impulse with different prayers , songs and texts . &quot;
&quot; but even on the way , the min@@ is at field cross@@ ings , chap@@ els or churches began to sing together again and again to sing a song from a specially produced pilgri@@ m song booklet . &quot;
par@@ is@@ hi@@ on@@ ers of the local par@@ ishes were available for overnight stays .
&quot; on the stop@@ pers , Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller ensured a tasty and strong dinner and breakfast . &quot;
on the second day we went on Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
&quot; the day after that , one stepped on the stage to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting stretch of road , but at the pup@@ il heat , at first some 500 metres of altitude had to be lowered and then rec@@ laimed . &quot;
&quot; in the evening , the deserved reward was a common gri@@ lling on the pond . &quot;
&quot; after the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter , it went to Freiburg on the final stage . &quot;
&quot; visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy , the Min@@ is arrived at the Freiburg Min@@ ster in the late afternoon and walked through the gates of mercy . &quot;
with a small impulse God was given thanks .
the min@@ is of the operator Markus Ober@@ t were welcomed at the evening mass in Münster .
after the divine service the pilgrims could visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .
the next day was still time for the Brei@@ s@@ gau metropolis .
in the afternoon we went back to Hor@@ b by train .
at the end all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were min@@ ted .
Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storms home when Br@@ ite Gold wins for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner last night in the men &apos;s team spr@@ int in the Vel@@ o@@ rom in Rio to fame when the British Team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the role that his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made himself to E@@ igen . the yen made the legend proud when he stor@@ med home to take home a victory from the favour@@ ites of New Zealand .
&quot; four years ago , England claimed a sho@@ cking victory , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic medals . &quot;
&quot; they repeated the trick , after winning only a modest sixth place in March at the London World Championships in London , despite the back of Ho@@ ys . &quot;
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as exec@@ utions .
Ho@@ ys retirement created a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man in which they stayed when they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that now un@@ folded .
&quot; Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y won the Olympic Champions in the qualification laps , but in the standard dogs the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the Du@@ el with gold .
&quot; after his lap , he was almost back , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it . &quot;
a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation in which Hin@@ des went in a higher gear to slow him down and allow Kenn@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
&quot; Ho@@ y looked at his position as a BBC expert and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des when they got on the podium . &quot;
&quot; Glasgow &apos;s 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner said , &quot; It &apos;s a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot;
I am only here to do my best and to make a name for myself .
&quot; in the final round , we set up an Olympic Record and the World Champion was defeated . &quot;
it was just incredible .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph in 2012 on the Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys page he admitted that after a weak start he deliberately fell off the track .
he returned this statement later and there was no objection to England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
&quot; with such an outstanding victory , there was no such problem this time . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; It feels like London on the tri@@ b@@ une with all the UK flags . &quot;
we have come together as a team over the last three months .
we did so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics .
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation that has been won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London . &quot;
&quot; if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect successful five days in the velo@@ drome . &quot;
with the form Kenn@@ ys it is possible to repeat Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition .
&quot; this would be for Kenn@@ y - exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( a seemingly holy date for British sports ; on the day also Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal . &quot;
that would be the same from Ho@@ y .
&quot; Kenn@@ y is next to the Sprint , who starts today and will go for three days . &quot;
&quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; said Hin@@ des : &quot; &quot; if he wins two more gold medals , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot;
&quot; it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England . &quot;
&quot; Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ kilometer race . &quot;
they arrived at the destination in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 42 .
&quot; world record , which won gold in 2012 in London , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 . &quot;
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety .
&quot; yesterday , he had argued with officials before the qualification , when function@@ aries called him to measure his height . &quot;
&quot; Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ el S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in World record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot;
the UK team relies on its strong train cycling team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and collect a number of medals .
&quot; after a truly exceptional presentation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down . &quot;
&quot; in the background , the res@@ ignation of Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton &apos;s technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton played in the middle of sex@@ ism and M@@ ob@@ b@@ ing@@ vor@@ es , as well as retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; however , if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the velo@@ drome , it looks quite like the legendary reputation of G@@ Bs , which at the perfect moment reached its climax , could be repeated again . &quot;
future of the melt production of Port@@ land on account of the lifting of the energy yield
&quot; the future of the aluminium mel@@ ts from Port@@ land in Victoria , as well as hundreds of work@@ stations of workers - are at stake , as the plant operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract and thereby abol@@ ishes all supply contracts , such as the supplying energy company . &quot;
&quot; this was followed by the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies for the operation of the plant . &quot;
a subsi@@ dy established for 20 years runs out in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the facility of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are at stake .
no less than 2000 jobs -@@ direct and indirect - could be at risk with closure .
&quot; in addition , it could come into dom@@ ino effects , as the melt production consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total electricity generation from Victori@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Al@@ coa completed the point Henry Schmel@@ zer@@ ei , which led to a closing of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year . &quot;
the enam@@ el of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks a closure .
&quot; this step follows years of speculation concerning the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently due to the electricity price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L supplies the large aluminium melting plant with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power station in Lat@@ robe Valley , announces that three more owners will announce their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the facility is located in the majority ownership of a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , from which Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p hold smaller portions . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity by melting , &quot; said the company . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts were so @-@ called &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging stores &quot; , &quot; which should have entered into force from November 2016 . &quot;
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month notice period so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; for this reason , AG@@ L expects that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to revenue , &quot; said the current supplier . &quot;
all potential impacts on AG@@ L revenues from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L announced that the value of the contracts had already been written down in its annual closing in the amount of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; expectation of a cancellation . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to apply the contracts , the &quot; ability of Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the enam@@ el or to ensure the power supply to the melt &quot; is not affected . &quot;
&quot; the US company said it had concluded a 20 year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang in 2010 , which would have entered into force from November this year even if it is still a declaration of why it has res@@ igned from the contract . &quot;
&quot; due to the bad economic conditions in the industry , analysts warn of the possible closure of Port@@ land Schmel@@ zer@@ ei in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle . &quot;
&quot; in reference to the statements by the analysts at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land uses around 600 meg@@ a@@ watts and tom@@ ago around 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity a year . &quot;
&quot; should both plants disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as a generating set , that wouldn &apos;t be good , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner , 20 , model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an J@@ enner Cl@@ an Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vo@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and ran to the fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced the news on her Inst@@ ag@@ ram account on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover made me cry , &quot; K@@ end@@ all wrote . &quot;
&quot; the cover of the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply keeping up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans similar ? ) , descrip@@ tive reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an J@@ enner family ( except for the problem cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n ) , as they forget the cover of their sister and ending with a classic twist : they all have a surprise party planned . &quot;
&quot; this represents the c@@ lich@@ é action almost every birthday sep@@ tic of a children &apos;s program ( Se@@ ac@@ ons brought the sentence , &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? &quot; , with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue , certainly a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans started . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ alls &apos;s big sister Kim likes her , as regards the Vo@@ gue cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself . &quot;
the September issue is for Vo@@ gue the most sold edition of the year .
&quot; with a circum@@ ference that is more similar to an illustrated book than a fashion magazine , the issue attracts a large number of advertis@@ ers ( Accor@@ ding to the 8@@ 32 pages of the tome 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) . &quot;
the revelation of his cover @-@ stars is so eag@@ erly anticipated that in the last two years pictures of the magazine were still se@@ eping before the official announcement .
&quot; women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and K@@ ate Mos@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties that mo@@ p &quot; as &quot; models , the celeb@@ ri@@ ties are &quot; on the cover . &quot;
&quot; Oscar winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour . &quot;
&quot; but even with the little chance that Mrs. J@@ enner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; breakthrough model &quot; &quot; of her generation - falls under the earlier category , it is in good company . &quot;
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people or reality stars or youths from today who know how to turn a good snap@@ chat video ( even if everything applies to J@@ enner ) .
they are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
&quot; Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade . &quot;
of course J@@ enn@@ ers don &apos;t like success to everybody .
&quot; with their reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the fashion world has always been a bit ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ enner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed and called them the mi@@ st@@ let@@ ins of the moment . &quot;
these feelings came up again when the message came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue Cover .
but it seems to be at the point to walk around at the point .
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
it runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer from Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
she and all her sisters sell pictures of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she is selling her own pictures of C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her free time she is seen in Reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
&quot; municipal law centers show up to 160@@ ,000 people per year &quot;
&quot; more than 160@@ ,000 of the country &apos;s aid con@@ ten@@ tions are rejected every year by the municipal law centers , while the industry faces the effects of further short@@ cuts on already over@@ loaded transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ o@@ gi@@ ations and the like - are rejected in their request for free legal advice and legal assistance . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the municipality , which are already busy at full capacity , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; from June next year , it is fores@@ een that these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds . &quot;
the director of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rel@@ l &apos;s community centre said that the last survey of the National Council of Commun@@ al Centr@@ es revealed that thousands of people have already been rejected every year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would only be worse if the Federal Government was canc@@ eled .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s municipal law centers are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means that thousands of people from important services you need are rejected , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relationships , people with un@@ man@@ a@@ geable and oppres@@ sive debt , families that go through separ@@ ations , workers who have been dismissed by separ@@ ations - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot receive the help they need . &quot;
&quot; the federal government will cut funds by 30 percent as of June 2017 , which means that thousands of people in need of Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; we call on the Federal Prosecutor and Justice Minister as well as sen@@ ators from Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately raise these short@@ cuts , so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance on the national average . &quot;
&quot; it is now time to look at the needs of the community centers and their communities , and that the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k has invested in this important work . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp campaig@@ ning after collabor@@ ators alleged to withdraw weapon
&quot; new York : Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s Campa@@ ign was accused of alleged in@@ action after her announcement that her campaign manager for North Carolina put a gun on an employee in February , while they were traveling in a je@@ ep in February . &quot;
&quot; the incident is described in an indictment , which was submitted to Charlotte by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i on Wednesday , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ordin@@ i announced , for months , to have maintained that the matter would be settled internally before it realized that &quot; this would not happen . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the campaign leader , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; drew a pist@@ ol , put his right finger on the trigger , and r@@ ammed the barrel in Vinc@@ ente Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i in his accus@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; having compla@@ ined to the local and regional campaign management , B@@ ordin@@ i stated that at least four more people had had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he gave up in the indictment . &quot;
&quot; weapons must not be fired to cause damage , &quot; &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i . &quot;
&quot; the accus@@ ation comes only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate dissolved a tur@@ mo@@ il when he said a crowd in North Carolina , that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; should take action , if his rival H@@ illary Clinton was elected and judge . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp@@ s campaign clearly stated that the media would have torn his words out of context , and that he would not inc@@ ite violence . &quot;
B@@ ordin@@ is complaint demands compensation from the campaign for the injury of due diligence and Philip because of bodily injury and lasting psychological damage .
Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s press conference in Hope Hi@@ cks was not to be reached for a statement .
attempts to contact Philip did not work out as well .
&quot; W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer a member of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; responding to calls from his consulting firm , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services , has not been re@@ acted . &quot;
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp has so far led a controversial campaign .
&quot; the trial is B@@ ordin@@ i by Donald J. Tru@@ mp For President Inc . , 16 @-@ CS @-@ 14@@ 300 , Supreme Court , County of Mecklenburg ( Charlotte ) . &quot;
Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before federal elections : the SPD and the CD@@ U lose
&quot; in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , significant losses are recorded for the SPD and CD@@ U government parties . &quot;
these are representative surveys of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
&quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition could continue to rule in the north , this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both federal states , however , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue to set up the head of government . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern the SPD collap@@ sed from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent , five years ago to 24 percent . &quot;
&quot; according to the survey , the party only sm@@ iled briefly before the CD@@ U , which could return to 23 percent again . &quot;
the third place is disputed between the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; the left would come to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; in spite of slight losses , the Gre@@ ens were reluct@@ ant to return to Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag in spite of slight losses ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented in the Land@@ tag each with 3 percent each .
&quot; according to the survey , the SPD of the Berlin Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties only came to 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) . &quot;
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
&quot; as a result , they still smile behind the Gre@@ ens at 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but in front of the left at 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
the Af@@ D would be represented at the Ab@@ ge@@ ord@@ net@@ enhaus with 14 percent for the first time .
&quot; in contrast to 2011 , the F@@ DP could hope for a return with 5 percent . &quot;
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
email and internet in slow motion : 20 years ago Nokia Communic@@ ator entered the market .
the success@@ ors dominate the world today - his maker experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed nearly half kilograms and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was thicker and bigger , so it wasn &apos;t good at hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was rather pal@@ p@@ able . &quot;
&quot; initially , the built @-@ in memory was eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would suff@@ ice today for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ ytes .
&quot; the &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; came to the stores exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few euros , fans can still buy the devices on the internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet Age . &quot;
&quot; 20 years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation . &quot;
&quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair &quot; &quot; C@@ eb@@ it in Hannover &quot; &quot; as an &quot; &quot; office in the western pocket format &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received for those standards : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax , the communic@@ ator was to be reached . &quot;
&quot; even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browsers , although tor@@ menting slowly . &quot;
&quot; a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar . &quot;
&quot; there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded up like a laptop . &quot;
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
&quot; the price was quite proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 Euro . &quot;
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
&quot; in August 1996 , no one could suspect that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era . &quot;
&quot; since then , everything has changed . &quot;
&quot; smart phones are a success story , although not for Nokia . &quot;
&quot; the Finn@@ s &quot; cell phone line experienced an unprecedented disaster , eventually sold and handled to Microsoft . &quot;
&quot; today , vendors are domin@@ ating the market , all of which came later as Nokia . &quot;
&quot; always and everywhere online , this is a daily routine for many people . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide . &quot;
&quot; around 1.4 billion units sold , Samsung and Apple alone account for 5@@ 55 million units alone . &quot;
the worldwide turnover with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running shops of the countless app providers and telec@@ om companies .
&quot; in the meantime , a whole industry has emerged around the smartphone . &quot;
&quot; the decisive breakthrough on the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , then Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the launch of the iPhone on the Mac @-@ World . &quot;
&quot; he promised three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an Internet communic@@ ator , all via touch screen easy to use . &quot;
&quot; Apple &apos;s trium@@ ph@@ al march began , and today the iPhone is the most important product of the company . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had the re@@ perc@@ ussions . &quot;
&quot; she finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot;
the sa@@ wing now have Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course for 20 years after its invention .
&quot; on average , every German now looks at his mobile phone 88 times a day . &quot;
&quot; we all have to learn to put the Smartphone away , &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , responsible for personnel in the Siemens Management Board . &quot;
permanent accessibility is now regarded as a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London but throughout the country .
&quot; for me , this was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just like in 2012 in London when we took a big effort to make sure all our nations and regions benefited from the games . &quot;
the Olympics brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and we will achieve this again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; for our local communities , we alone have already 10,000 new apprenti@@ ces , creating 40,000 new jobs and putting an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of the extension of He@@ ath@@ row is too great . &quot;
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ aming at the world stage .
the two @-@ f@@ ishers were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answers every question put to him . &quot;
&quot; like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project . &quot;
&quot; expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 2@@ 11 bn in wit@@ ty growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both to the airport and in the UK . &quot;
&quot; we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from T@@ 5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to the T@@ 2 , which was built in the midst of the two most popular cat@@ walks in the world . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion on private investment . &quot;
London &apos;s games of 2012 were a great success for UK and I am confident that He@@ ath@@ row &apos;s expansion will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as ensure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .

&quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz and M@@ ouse Game &quot; regarding ad blocking &quot;
&quot; for companies that earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software producers try to b@@ ypass ad blocking , a &quot; cat and mouse game . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block advertisements on its desktop page , Ad@@ block Plus announced a blo@@ g@@ post in which users could update their filters in the program to further block advertising on the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the coding for its advertisements , in order to make it difficult to detect displays of view on which part of the site is advertising . &quot;
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to handle the new codes .
&quot; in a blog post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her @-@ Stru@@ ggle between the An@@ tim@@ il@@ bla@@ zing Open Source Community and the Um@@ ers has been underway since the invention of displays &quot; , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution . &quot;
the fact that the world &apos;s largest company has entered the fight for social media is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying indicators have become the industry .
&quot; according to a study conducted by Pa@@ w@@ air and Adobe , around 200 million people worldwide use the display lock@@ ers worldwide , almost four times as much in 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 1.@@ 03 billion active users who access Facebook via their mobile devices , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of advertis@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the company , apart from the fact that mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ ag@@ ram , shared a spokesperson . &quot;
advertising on desktop PCs accounts for a large proportion of income so that Facebook seems worthwhile to invest in such a step .
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update its &quot; advertising preview pool &quot; in order to have more control over it . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ block new filters were wor@@ rying because they would also block content on the page that are not advertising . &quot;
&quot; for the users this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; shared a Facebook spokes@@ man in an email message . &quot;
&quot; ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt tool , which is why we instead focused on developer tools like Ad Pre@@ ferences in order to put more control into the hands of people . &quot;
woman with presum@@ ed suicide on Swiss motorway
the victim lay in the middle of the night on the highway .
&quot; the police are calling for witnesses , after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday passed by a presum@@ ed suicide of several vehicles on a motorway . &quot;
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
&quot; a woman lay in the dark &quot; in an act of despair &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , the police told in Vau@@ d . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a Swiss man , at the age of 49 , who was attacked by several vehicles , including a lor@@ ry , wanted to kill himself . &quot;
she died still on the spot .
&quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified , said the police , asking them , as well as any witnesses of the incident , to sign up . &quot;
&quot; an investigation procedure was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter shared the Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed . &quot;
was a clas@@ h avoid@@ able ?
&quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter . &quot;
two similar cases over the past five years show that the drivers will not be held ac@@ countable .
&quot; in each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the highway - it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian goes on the motorway in the middle of the night , as it was said in the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; last year a police officer was acqu@@ itted of the neg@@ ligent killing , after having passed a man and killed a man lying on the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and had become unconscious on the street , took the court . &quot;
&quot; the court noted that the police -- who had answered an emergency call -- went on a justified way and that the presence of a man on the road was a &quot; completely extraordinary and un@@ predictable situation , &quot; said the judge . &quot;
anyone who has further information on the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus was once hab@@ itable
&quot; according to the projections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was probably once hab@@ itable . &quot;
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms similar to those of climate scientists .
&quot; the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could once have revealed similar conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere . &quot;
scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere and still revol@@ ved slowly . &quot;
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably showed more dry areas than Earth , but once had enough water and geographic vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protected from rapid evap@@ oration . &quot;
the early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow revolution of Venus exposed its day @-@ side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from most of the sun &apos;s heat . &quot;
the result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than the Earth today .
&quot; the model brought forth a history of Venus , similar to evolution that had previously been suspected by planetary researchers . &quot;
&quot; although it was believed to be hab@@ itable , Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light over the course of several billion years . &quot;
their oceans evap@@ or@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was burnt away by ultra@@ violet light .
&quot; as their hydro@@ gen , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , which we know today . &quot;
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy comes back as a coach of the Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy retired on Thursday as coach and vice president of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and led a too low co @-@ determination right in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
&quot; alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noticed that the association will immediately look for a new trainer . &quot;
&quot; over the last three years I have met my duties as head coach and vice president of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a position . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the summer , I thought about how I could improve this team to give him more depth , this needed and to bring it to a higher level . &quot;
&quot; in order to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and vice president of Ho@@ ckey Operations needs to be perfectly adapted to the organization . &quot;
it must also have a right of co @-@ determination in decisions that influence the team &apos;s performance .
these conditions are currently not met .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team . &quot;
&quot; Patrick informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot;
we all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future .
Roy was awarded the best coach of the league during his debut season at the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards .
&quot; he led the association to 112 points and on the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed in each of the last two years the post@@ season . &quot;
the Aval@@ an@@ ches posted a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the game for a second wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference to score five points .
&quot; as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadi@@ ens and the Aval@@ an@@ che . &quot;
&quot; Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ pers take talks again , strike off strike &quot;
&quot; the labour struggles with regard to remuneration for the North Sea oil workers will be exposed , while all armed parties sit at the table for a new round of talks , said negoti@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; strikes against the oil @-@ field service provider Wood Group were conducted spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell . &quot;
&quot; wood Group and the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of the current dispute , &quot; &quot; said it in a common statement . &quot;
we will stop some full day sessions over the next few weeks that will begin at the beginning of next year in order to restart the problems .
&quot; the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; this year , Wood Group has shortened the rates to its counter@@ parts in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure . &quot;
the company &apos;s credit rating follows a 10 % decline for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts to the company give the company the required space to come through the market down@@ turn .
&quot; Shell has released thousands of people for its part and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its mega @-@ merger with the British energy company BG Group . &quot;
&quot; energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that has intensified by the British decision in June to leave the European Union . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week , the Scottish parliament member Dave Anderson met with workers &quot; leaders to discuss one of the biggest disputes that had occurred in the North Sea since a generation . &quot;
&quot; the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said . &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country , we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion will be expected to spend on new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of stars in the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest Mission with the Ke@@ pler Wel@@ traum@@ atic Teles@@ cope helped astronom@@ ers collect the most complete catalog of rot@@ ational rates under the stars of the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
&quot; the new data help astronom@@ ers understand why stars revol@@ ve at different rates in the star cluster , as well as in what context the rotation periods are associated with planetary creation . &quot;
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other star enh@@ ancements , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the star @-@ pile of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light @-@ years away from the earth .
&quot; many stars in this cluster , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ th@@ ood . &quot;
they are now turning the fastest .
&quot; at peak rot@@ ational rates , these po@@ ign@@ ant stars meet large quantities of star@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; as these winds travel through the stars of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star ages , its rotation rate begins to slow down . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sun@@ spots -- .
the latest catalog of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more solid stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es stars with dancers . larger stars slow down pi@@ rou@@ ettes as smaller ones .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades , we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; since the star @-@ pile of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates . &quot;
&quot; the star @-@ pile of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; there is still a lot to us about what we would like to know more about how , when and why stars slow down their rotation rates , and so to speak up their &quot; dance shoes . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Reb@@ ull and their colleagues reported in detail about their latest analysis of the ple@@ j@@ ades , which will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal . &quot;
a controversial bas@@ eball @-@ star res@@ ig@@ ns
the tears ran at Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez faster than the US bas@@ eball star in best days from Base to Base .
&quot; after his emotional return announcement , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will be carrying the jer@@ sey of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es on August 12 against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &apos; Goo@@ db@@ ye &apos; to join , &quot; &quot; said the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star Game participant of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was elected the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot;
&quot; since 2007 , his signature under a ten @-@ year contract has been awarded to him annually 27 million US dollars . &quot;
&quot; by the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will in future act as a consultant and youth coach - with full salary . &quot;
as a player Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid a long time with performance .
&quot; with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es he managed some mil@@ estones . &quot;
&quot; with Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two more bas@@ eball players have similar values in the most important statistics . &quot;
&quot; however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should not be admitted to the glory hall of the bas@@ eb@@ alls . &quot;
because so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; - on the field was so controversial his appearance outside the court .
&quot; in 2009 , the super@@ star was admitted to &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; to have taken no ster@@ oids banned from 2001 to 2003 . &quot;
&quot; in August 2013 , he was closed for 2@@ 11 games due to a development in the so @-@ called &quot; Bio@@ gen@@ esis Sc@@ andal &quot; by the end of 2014 . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered the main suspect to have received high @-@ performance funds for years through an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
&quot; after a law@@ suit , the lock was still reduced to 162 meetings . &quot;
&quot; the League could even have done me a favor for 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said at that time . &quot;
also his farewell days are not silent .
&quot; while many bas@@ eball legends win the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was often forced to sit on the bench . &quot;
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes trying to win any game , &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di . &quot;
&quot; after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and succ@@ eeds with the relations with Pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress K@@ ate Hudson , got sympathy @-@ conver@@ sions of the fans of Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ Arch@@ riv@@ ale Boston Red So@@ x . &quot;
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; sung the followers at 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez @-@ Team . &quot;
&quot; Olympic 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases &quot;
&quot; caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing test , wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland cannot compete in Rio . &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing attacks .
a smu@@ g@@ gled ath@@ lete would have won almost a medal .
&quot; before the seventh race day , the first official dop@@ ing accidents became known as the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese float in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 meter steep@@ le in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa from Bulgaria and Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested and ruled out in Brazil - immediately prior to the start of the already critically observed athle@@ tics competitions these messages come to the time . &quot;
&quot; in Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de had been proven last Sunday , which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances . &quot;
&quot; on Friday afternoon , the International Sports Court of CA@@ S confirmed its expul@@ sion from the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old occupied the fourth place in the fin@@ als over 100 m of butterfly , only 0.@@ 09 seconds passed the bronze medal . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en would have participated in the runs over 50 m fre@@ estyle . &quot;
&quot; at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) , the opening of the B @-@ trial and a hearing has been requested . &quot;
&quot; the national federation takes the matter &quot; very seriously and demands a full cooperation in the investigations , &quot; said X@@ in@@ hua : &quot; we will work with the International Sports Court CA@@ S and will accept the judgment . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history , IO@@ C is no longer responsible , but the CA@@ S is responsible for the san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; also in the night of Rio , the news came about the positive test at Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on the offensive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this was an incredible shock , &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; she is innocent , &quot; the only explanation might be dietary supplements , &quot; the ath@@ lete explained . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , it is said that the banned substance is the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ ova was temporarily suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample should have already been positive . &quot;
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v promptly reported to the ath@@ lete &apos;s report .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes don &apos;t draw the right conclusions , &quot; he said : &quot; we arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
&quot; in this way , about all wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dou@@ bling nation should not participate in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested like his brother Tom@@ as@@ z three days earlier on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon . &quot;
&quot; both of them deny intake , but both may not start in the class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; before the athletes start , Dan@@ ek@@ ova is another heavy blow to the reputation of the whole sport . &quot;
&quot; the World Federation IA@@ AF had prohibited the entire Russian squ@@ ad except for systematic dop@@ ing , even the Ken@@ yan government produced numerous bad news in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the former injuries in China caused severe confron@@ tations between the athletes in the swimming sport . &quot;
Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Y@@ ang Har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt purple , &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium more than 200 m fre@@ estyle , I want to hand over myself , &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio . &quot;
sun was also the focal point of a discussion with the Australian M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing frau@@ d@@ sters , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; sun had been tested positively in the Chinese champi@@ onships in 2014 on the stimul@@ ant tri@@ met@@ azi@@ dine , but only had to sit down a three @-@ month lock . &quot;
Dat@@ enk@@ lau : so Per@@ fi@@ de er@@ uns h@@ ack@@ ers their ran@@ som
programmers of black@@ mail users currently use targeted companies - and they are successful .
&quot; according to a recent survey of malware defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes among 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of surv@@ eyed companies in the past twelve months were at least once , partly multiple victims of an attack with black@@ mail software . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware @-@ black@@ mail . &quot;
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ran@@ som paid by the perpetr@@ ators to re@@ use the challenged systems and data .
&quot; according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes , the perpetr@@ ators spec@@ ulate on attacks in company networks . &quot;
&quot; if they are successful there , the potential for rede@@ em@@ ing ran@@ som is significantly higher than with private users . &quot;
&quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of the malware , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most of the malware programs were designed to send advertisements . &quot;
then the perpetr@@ ators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
&quot; first of all , private users were the target , but the change to company attacks occurred quickly over the past few months . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once on the computer of an victim , it searches for recently modified files such as Word@@ - , Excel or Database files as well as archives of pictures and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ ts the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als permanently .
&quot; subsequently , the software presents the demands of the black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; in order to get the final key code to the files , the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of Cryp@@ to@@ currencies Bit@@ coin . &quot;
&quot; but where private users use the personal photo database on the game , companies are concerned about sensitive customer data or project databases without which production stops . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the damage occurs when a ran@@ som@@ ware performs . &quot;
&quot; 22 percent of the affected German companies reported loss of revenue due to Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to break their business completely , in one case people were in danger of life . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be acute by the loss of patient records . &quot;
&quot; we always tell the victims : it doesn &apos;t pay , it only promotes the problem , &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay will get their data again .
&quot; for managers , it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetr@@ ators in view of still stagn@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the h@@ ack@@ ers , in turn , know that and try to build a good reputation . &quot;
&quot; in a recent study , the safety researchers of F @-@ Secure have examined the user interface and contact with the black@@ mail and come to the conclusion : the perpetr@@ ators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money . &quot;
&quot; they tell their victims per chat how they can pay per Bit@@ coin , set up freely accessible support websites or de@@ cryp@@ t sample files for free . &quot;
&quot; and if private individuals are redeemed after payments of a few hundred Euro , companies must partly negotiate hard and pay five @-@ figure sums to get their data un@@ encrypted . &quot;
&quot; in view of the potentially high and relatively low @-@ risk gains from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , the h@@ ack@@ ers are becoming more professional and share their work , said security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the anti @-@ virus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware about within a week . &quot;
&quot; however , it is more likely that it is about three or four people . &quot;
the programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software modular system to the actual black@@ mail .
&quot; malware kits have been created by buying malware , consulting and additional tools for a one @-@ time , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; the scope of delivery includes a adjustment tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski says . &quot;
the black@@ mail customers are then looking for more h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
&quot; so one logs in one of the forums on the ground , bu@@ ys the set of one criminals and instruc@@ ts another to install the software on as many PCs as possible . &quot;
payment is made on a registered calcul@@ ator .
&quot; usually the criminals then commission sp@@ amm@@ ers with the spread , &quot; &quot; Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski explains . &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that better protect their data .
over 50 percent of the companies IT leaders in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey confi@@ de to rep@@ el Ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file back @-@ ups and scanner software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; when data encryption is no longer a sufficient threat to successful recovery , the perpetr@@ ators are threatening to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; thus , the potential for damage , depending on the type of data , is much higher than before . &quot;
&quot; in the future , the perpetr@@ ators could also entirely focus on new targets on the internet of things . &quot;
&quot; at the Hack@@ er@@ konferenz , Def@@ con , security researchers demonstrated how to control a thermo@@ stat that was connected to the Internet under their control . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the winter , the activation of such a block@@ aded heating could well be worth a ran@@ som . &quot;
&quot; if the perpetr@@ ators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
&quot; Honda will pack everything in the small HR @-@ V : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é , and also the versatility of a mini van . &quot;
&quot; sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the HR @-@ V is only 1.@@ 60 m tall , the passengers have a lot of space in both the front row and rear . &quot;
&quot; the interior materials are well finished and work pleasant , only the cockpit upper side drops off . &quot;
&quot; versatile than comparable vehicles , the HR @-@ V is in the storage space . &quot;
&quot; it is not only a trunk of 4@@ 53 l with raised back rests and 10@@ 26 l in case of inver@@ ted back rests , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot; &quot;
this is less magical than it sounds : the seat areas of the rear bench can be folded up like a movie seat and thus offer storage space that is up to a height of 1.@@ 24 m from the floor to the ceiling .
&quot; the trunk can be loaded well , but the height at 650 mm is somewhat higher than that of the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm , the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V power@@ fully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm . &quot;
&quot; however , he should do his work a little qui@@ eter . &quot;
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is pleasing .
there is another mot@@ ori@@ zation : a 1.5 l gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynam@@ ism and comfort . &quot;
but steering should be a bit more direct .
&quot; the equipment in the top variant &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; leaves nothing to be desired . &quot;
&quot; the security systems include the City emergency braking system ( operates up to speed 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane support assistant . &quot;
&quot; the collision warning sometimes irrit@@ ates , because during manoeu@@ v@@ ring , he evalu@@ ates many obstacles as &quot; &quot; approaching objects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high @-@ beam assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent template responds to the traffic sign recognition and th@@ rot@@ tles the speed if necessary .
&quot; however , full connectivity is only available for the top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation device , app integration and more . &quot;
two USB and one HDMI sockets are located underneath the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat cum@@ ber@@ some to reach .
&quot; the roughly 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are al@@ right . &quot;
&quot; those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will receive the gasoline engine from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
&quot; with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday @-@ friendly car . &quot;
airline is not liable : fall on passenger jet@@ ty
an airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger jet@@ ty .
the Higher Regional Court of Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) ar@@ gues that a liability is conceivable only for dangers which are typical of air traffic .
the pla@@ inti@@ ff had broken a knee in the fall .
&quot; however , the accident could have occurred everywhere - it was a general risk of life , such as judgment . &quot;
the airline had to pay no compensation to the man .
case of sickness : when is the organizer
sick vac@@ ation@@ ers will only get money back after their trip if the cause of the disease can be found in the hotel without a doubt .
&quot; however , this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have shown the same symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in the case , a family was severely ill from diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting on the second day of their stay . &quot;
she spent most of the vacation in the room .
&quot; their condition brought the vac@@ ation@@ ers back to a defective treatment plant , which allegedly poll@@ uted the sea water . &quot;
the family had the view that the trip was fla@@ wed - and compla@@ ined against the organis@@ er .
&quot; in court , the pla@@ inti@@ ffs had no success . &quot;
&quot; indeed , the sewage treatment plant was indeed defective . &quot;
but the promot@@ er informed only shortly before departure of the pla@@ inti@@ ffs .
until then he had to assume that sea@@ water was al@@ right .
&quot; he did not viol@@ ate his duty of information , thus the judgment . &quot;
especially since there were no im@@ puri@@ ties found in the water samples .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by con@@ ta@@ gion among themselves - belongs to the general risk of life .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
&quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère said , after the violent acts of violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people would have worried about further attacks . &quot;
the state must be pru@@ dent and determined at the same time to respond to terrorism .
&quot; certainly , our country will not answer the violence of the perpetr@@ ators with hatred and division . &quot;
we will not allow this triumph to the terrorists .
&quot; if the perpetr@@ ators had to leave the country faster , this would increase the security and increase the approval of the population for refugee policy . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère wants to achieve the implementation of the proposals until the Bundestag election in 2017 .
&quot; he also announced another personnel strengthening of the security forces , namely &quot; in medium four @-@ digit scale order over several years . &quot; &quot;
sympathy for terrorism must again be punished .
&quot; video surveillance is to be improved , the weapon law can be amended as much as the purchase of weapons on the Internet is made more difficult . &quot;
the last much discussed duty of confidentiality for physicians should be maintained according to De Mai@@ zi@@ ères &apos;s words .
&quot; however , he wants to look for solutions in dialogue with the medical profession , how the endanger@@ ment of the citizens can be reduced , he said at a glance about psych@@ ic ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; in order to counter@@ act the radic@@ alisation of refugees , the Minister considers a better social support necessary . &quot;
teachers would have to be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mati@@ zed people .
&quot; in order to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère plans to use cover@@ t investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to enhancing safety . &quot;
it is important that the Interior Minister has spoken clearly against action .
&quot; this was a sla@@ p for the sni@@ pers in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel told the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke media group ( Friday ) . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had previously rejected calls from the Union after a Bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of double nationality .
a general prohibition of full @-@ wear is problematic for constitutional purposes .
&quot; you can &apos;t for@@ bid everything you reject , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka . &quot;
talk about rules about road traffic or for witnesses in court .
&quot; green boss Sim@@ one Peter accused the minister , he wanted to simulate with ever new anti @-@ terrorist acts of action and ability to act . &quot;
&quot; Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; fleet Pro@@ verb@@ s and a tigh@@ tening of the right of stay bring people in this country no more security . &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway bridge
it st@@ alls regularly on the b@@ ypass road - here is a picture of November .
but this shall change : the settlement of the law shall be extended .
&quot; this is good news for all cars , who are driving in traffic on the ambient street every night in traffic when driving over the motorway to Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) , the road construction will be extended by the Hammer Street and the Wes@@ er Straße exit at 700 meters . &quot;
car drivers can then drive directly from the Hammer Street to the right .
&quot; the major advantage : the traffic con@@ veys at the same time , whereby the total course is improved on the busy section of the federal road 51 . &quot;
&quot; the idea , with the extended exit , had the CD@@ U faction in the district , representing Münster @-@ West . &quot;
the road nar@@ rowing on the feeder anno@@ ys the drivers above all between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
&quot; on week@@ days , the back @-@ sta@@ u extends to the bridge over the Alber@@ ten@@ er Weg and sometimes beyond . &quot;
the reason is the needle @-@ hole on the B 51 shortly before the exit Wes@@ er Straße .
&quot; from here , traffic is guided only one @-@ lane through the motorway bridge . &quot;
the second track had to be built back a good one @-@ three @-@ quarter years ago .
&quot; the reason : static calculations showed that the bridge no longer possesses the required load capacity , in order to include two @-@ lane especially for heavy @-@ duty traffic . &quot;
&quot; how long this bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and the related week@@ day traffic jam will continue , the local government cannot say . &quot;
&quot; however , it has to be reck@@ oned with years : because the bridge has an official remaining term until 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the settlement agreement , the state @-@ owned company deliberately chose the weaker time during the school holidays because of the possibility of a disability . &quot;
traffic is passed on Tuesday and Wednesday at the construction site .
intercultural Travel : cultural offerings for schools
&quot; the international class of forest school visited the play &quot; &quot; Das Un@@ visible House &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theatre are now planning a music project .
N@@ ima &apos;s association enables young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; the &quot; Class International &quot; of the Woo@@ den School Children &apos;s House has attended a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; Das Un@@ seen House &quot; of the Junge Theater Münster , Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; initiated by the association N@@ ima &apos;s , 19 students from 11 to 15 years visited the production in the small house . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims for the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Mu@@ en@@ ster within the framework of this project . &quot;
&quot; the majority of young people in the class had come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 , among others from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria , and spoke little German . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic pictures and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action nonetheless , such as the press release of the boy Theater Münster . &quot;
&quot; the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg from Spra@@ chen@@ ko , and the young theatre will work together in the coming season as part of a music theatre project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December , young people with and without a refugee and migration background will have the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the areas of singing , dance , acting and music . &quot;
offers for children and families in the area of theatre play and theatrical language teaching are in the planning .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
&quot; given the increased number of refugees , the association counts with many classes who want to participate . &quot;
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for improvement of weather
the weather has made the star @-@ car@@ p @-@ Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the southwest of Germany a stroke through the bill on Friday - but there is still hope .
&quot; the night was bad for clouds and rain to observe the cel@@ esti@@ al spectacle , said the chairman of the Stern@@ warte Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning . &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather should be good , then we &apos;ll see many shooting stars in the sky . &quot;
&quot; the shooting stars are Per@@ sei@@ des , which with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour belong to the fastest shooting stars . &quot;
&quot; they have their name , because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation of Per@@ se@@ us , rising up in the north @-@ east . &quot;
relaxing night : tips for sleeping disorders
&quot; in the evening , one walks around etern@@ ally , at night , one is awake for hours , in the morning it is no longer possible to think of sleep in the morning . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; after all , one is with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about one quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or dur@@ ably than not restor@@ ative . &quot;
how do sleep problems or sleep disorders manifest ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many causes behind them , says Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eß , Member of the Executive Board of the German Society for S@@ leep Research and S@@ leep Medicine . &quot;
&quot; but the in@@ som@@ nia , therefore , is a single and dor@@ man@@ t disorder . &quot;
&quot; just sleep many people feel uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , member of the board of the German Medical Association with practice in the Lower Saxony Var@@ el . &quot;
what &apos;s behind sleep problems ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
&quot; there can be organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medicines . &quot;
sleep distur@@ b@@ ance is often an expression of another disease .
&quot; very early awakening is especially common in a depression , &quot; &quot; says We@@ eß . &quot;
and it can be that different factors require each other .
&quot; for example , who has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can lie poorly , w@@ akes up every two to three hours and possibly starts to pon@@ der on everyday problems and worries , there is one example . &quot;
&quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
when should you become a doctor with sleep disorders ?
those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week should go to the doctor advised .
&quot; impair@@ ment can be quite different : one is beaten , tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical discomfort such as stomach or head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; to allevi@@ ate the sleep problem , it is important to find out their causes . &quot;
&quot; treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or medication - classical stroke tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ eligible . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , low medical doctors hardly exist , emphasizes Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary sleep @-@ medical centre of the Char@@ ité Universitäts@@ medizin Berlin . &quot;
&quot; therefore , when sleeping problems , one should contact the primary doctor first . &quot;
it can investigate whether the problems have a physical cause .
&quot; who should go to sleep , and what happens ? &quot;
&quot; for example , in the case of snor@@ ing with breathing cut@@ ters , for example in sleeping bags or if you don &apos;t find the cause of a sleeping disorder , Fi@@ etze explains . &quot;
it is not necessary to prepare for the investigation .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; only please do not make a n@@ ap , &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
&quot; after the sti@@ cking , one goes to bed at its normal time . &quot;
&quot; besides the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose @-@ glasses , a chest strap and a sensor on the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera draws on the sleeping end at the ceiling . &quot;
how can affected parties get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of adjusting screws on which you can set for a better sleep .
&quot; it counts on : regular sleeping and recording times , not too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , do not watch TV for falling asleep , stop drinking alcohol and don &apos;t look at the clock at night - then one starts to reck@@ on immediately , and that is not condu@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
what the Jung@@ le Camp has to have with missing medals in swimming
the former German float Markus Dei@@ bler has commented on Facebook for the dis@@ ap@@ pointing result of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
&quot; in December 2014 , he took Gold for the first time at the Doh@@ a short @-@ circuit nation@@ als and at the same time posed his first world record . &quot;
the former DS@@ V @-@ ath@@ lete Markus Dei@@ bler has now placed himself in front of his ex @-@ team @-@ mates standing in the criticism .
&quot; in a country where an Olympic champion receives 20,000 € bonus and a Jung@@ le King 15@@ 0.000 € , nobody should wonder about missing medals , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote at night on his Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; the support system in swimming sport is bad , however , the dop@@ ing controls are very good . &quot;
&quot; with this , we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not look as closely as possible or even operate on the subject of dop@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls are to be set here , &quot; &quot; he explained . &quot;
&quot; if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ ty would have to be reported already nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot;
this is exactly how one should keep it with countries .
&quot; who cannot be controlled for a certain time before WM / OS by independent controllers of WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not participate , &quot; &quot; says the election @-@ ham@@ burger , who meanwhile runs an ic@@ e@@ di@@ ele . &quot;
airport : arrest of Bag@@ gage Li@@ ves arrested
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
&quot; on Thursday , the arrest of two women and two men between the ages of 50 and 61 took place on Thursday . &quot;
the susp@@ ects had made several pick@@ pockets and luggage pil@@ es as a gang .
&quot; at 9.@@ 30 p.m. civil servants in the area of the Düsseldorf Airport detected a gang , which was well @-@ known to the polic@@ emen from past anti @-@ theft reports . &quot;
&quot; the two women and two men had committed a number of off@@ ences since the middle of July , and they were especially professional , industri@@ ous and especially professional . &quot;
&quot; the Speci@@ alists of the Com@@ miss@@ ariat of Com@@ miss@@ ar 34 can demonstrate four acts to the thi@@ eves , who had entered Germany exclusively for crimes committed in Germany . &quot;
&quot; they had captured a total of more than 15,000 Euros . &quot;
&quot; the Riga road in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in doesn &apos;t look like that , but the police is one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; when one goes along the road from east to west , one passes to play@@ grounds , a newly painted kinder@@ garten and a bio @-@ shop . &quot;
&quot; on the facade of a gray house , someone has spra@@ yed &quot; ug@@ ly ! . &quot; &quot;
&quot; compared to a Li@@ dl , which is to be demol@@ ished soon , it is already being built : until 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new flats is to be built here . &quot;
&quot; in recent weeks , however , articles about this &quot; trendy district , &quot; as the responsible housing estate company Friedrichsha@@ in , are preferred by burning cars . &quot;
&quot; the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have rental contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin interior sen@@ ator Henkel had spoken several times for a hard action by the police against the project , the area referred to as &quot; no @-@ go @-@ zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous force . &quot;
&quot; on June 22nd , the police evacu@@ ated the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , with 300 police officers , pat@@ rolled off official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three team @-@ cars on site , locked off parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94 . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , construction workers commissioned the rooms on behalf of the unknown home@@ owners . &quot;
&quot; on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that clearing was illegal , and a day later police and construction workers removed from sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon , the street looks peaceful : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others talk about late late . &quot;
&quot; in the immediate vicinity of the house projects , there is a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens . &quot;
&quot; left violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the Kie@@ z since 1999 , and Jan@@ a * , who carries out three children here , are mainly irrit@@ ated by the police presence . &quot;
&quot; with the inhabitants of the house projects , they share the concern for increasing r@@ ami@@ fications and gent@@ ri@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; it does not sound like a Kie@@ z , who wished for majority police protection against v@@ and@@ ali@@ ating lef@@ ti@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; the tr@@ ench , which the Berlin interior sen@@ ator and the police opened between house occup@@ ants and their neighbors , apparently does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Friedrichsha@@ in in East Berlin was actually a traditional working @-@ class district , which also today compared to the rest of the city has a low average income and a high risk of poverty . &quot;
&quot; house occup@@ ations and the resulting residential projects have long been part of the neighbourhood : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer Strasse very close to the R@@ ī@@ ga . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer had been evacu@@ ated under large police orders in a regular street battle , many of the projects in the R@@ ī@@ ga were leg@@ alized and some of them were still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the district has become a magnet for tourists and constitu@@ ents from all over the world over the past few years . &quot;
&quot; this is also reflected in the r@@ ents , which have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 . &quot;
many of the new buildings in the R@@ ī@@ ga are attacked as symbols for this development : they can be seen on inserted discs or freshly painted fac@@ ades that have been thrown off with bags of paint .
no other road was mentioned this year as often together with the words &quot; left @-@ handed power . &quot;
&quot; one reason that not all neighbours look at this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes such as bodily injury , according to statistics , are almost exclusively directed against polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; most of the crimes are causing property damage , which tend to meet new@@ builds and newly renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has lived in a rented house beside the controversial 94 for 17 years , there can be no talk of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; as far as violence is concerned , it is important : people in the 94 are their neighbors , they were not destined to be . &quot;
even the famous burning cars are no longer available at the Riga R@@ ī@@ ga anymore .
&quot; for the architect , her street is not a criminal focus , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the street and gets more from one another , than elsewhere . &quot; &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has deliberately moved into the R@@ ī@@ ga Street - and remained .
&quot; for this reason it was also so important that the residents got their way back : from the police , politics and the media , who suddenly claimed the interpretation sovereignty over the district in July . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the street will continue to be taken away from them : through fac@@ eless new buildings in former buildings , which disp@@ lace the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in the end , these are fre@@ ehold flats which are not interesting for many - here people prefer people who are not so well sto@@ cked , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction I can absolutely not appro@@ ve . &quot;
but what can you do if someone never list@@ ens to someone ?
&quot; there is fru@@ stration on all sides , including the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; for those who stum@@ ble over colour bombs , Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the house projects and the left scene belong to the Kie@@ z . &quot;
&quot; who goes on , should be aware of it - just like someone who moves into a pub district can complain badly about noise there . &quot;
all persons represented only by first names have asked not to be named with their correct name .
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee commission@@ er
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in matters of integration and organis@@ er .
she is also a social worker on site .
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee commission@@ er for Ur@@ bach since July .
the social educ@@ ator supports the team of the administration for Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; it sees itself as a contact for all actors : refugees , workers for refugees , administration , authorities and anyone else involved . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine customer of the working group indicates that the honorary official are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the freezing wo@@ ol@@ d@@ sau , which has above all a problem . &quot;
&quot; in this way , some - less spot@@ ting than the multitude of task areas - meant to be targeted - meant when the administration wanted to leave the place . &quot;
&quot; looking for an administrative force with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , a self @-@ reli@@ ant wo@@ ol@@ d@@ sau . &quot;
&quot; but administrative work is not their central area , meaning Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; above all , it is about organization , work with local people and behind the scenes as well as networking activities . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 @-@ percent position on three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time actors . &quot;
&quot; there are big and small problems , organisational , human and communication problems . &quot;
soon new containers stand in the street
&quot; for some time , a serious problem has been to find apartments for connecting flights that have been recognized . &quot;
local authorities are responsible for the connection provision .
they must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented dormit@@ ories .
&quot; the cost of building , rent or renovation of these accommodations must be borne by municipalities themselves . &quot;
the responsibility changes from the ste@@ wards to the municipality and Job@@ centers .
&quot; problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment . &quot;
the search has been very difficult for some time .
&quot; de facto , the administration does not find private apartments . &quot;
&quot; so far , it didn &apos;t work so far , you depend on private apartments , according to Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , common apartments must be in@@ timi@@ dated as it is so beautiful . &quot;
so soon new containers will be erected in the washing line .
but it is not done with apartments .
&quot; perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a fixed place , there are intern@@ ships , training places , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and employment activities for refugees and migrants who need to be tiled or set up . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building yard or help house masters , do char@@ itable work - and that motiv@@ ates and very neat , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports . &quot;
she hopes the work for the community leads to a positive external action .
that is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
&quot; the day needs a firm structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer . &quot;
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
&quot; so I need offers like sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses . &quot;
professional courses are rare .
&quot; thus , administration and honorary official also jump here . &quot;
it is important that the refugees have the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; they have to explain the refugees that it takes time and they can bridge the time wis@@ ely , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; those who eventually develop the feeling that he couldn &apos;t help anyone in Ur@@ bach could not work and be useless , he will never integrate . &quot;
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; but there are problems , says customer honestly , &quot; people with whom nothing goes . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
all this is already a &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task . &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : do the two have fear of radic@@ alisation after the recent incidents , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; Reg@@ ine customer says quite clearly , &quot; what some may call na@@ ï@@ ve . &quot; a residual risk could and may not exclude them . &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these incidents are also subject to the refugees .
they would have the fear that the assass@@ ins put them completely in demand .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; so , main and honorary officials have to look out for activities in the region and in the region . &quot;
they have always in the background that soon a new push to refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a ceiling ?
the question clearly to answer is the policy .
actually it is unfair to put them hel@@ pers on site .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we haven &apos;t reached where we want to go , &quot; &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; no new refugees , that would be able to relax . &quot;
Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bach are already busy integrating the previous people sensi@@ bly .
&quot; these are currently around 100 people , mainly young men . &quot;
&quot; but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree . &quot;
&quot; the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers . &quot;
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : bur@@ gl@@ ars looking for helicop@@ ters
the police helicopter flew different areas for about an hour - un@@ successful .
two unknown men have forci@@ bly entered into an apartment in a multi @-@ family house in the Lin@@ den@@ weg on Friday morning at 8 : 50 am .
the residents surprised the two and struck the un@@ fet@@ tered in the escape .
&quot; the two men were about 1.@@ 65 to 1.@@ 70 meters tall , probably mas@@ ked , wore both Blue@@ jeans and black hoo@@ dies . &quot;
they fled towards the city center .
&quot; as a reminder , the police deployed several expe@@ ditions as well as a police helicopter . &quot;
the gro@@ unding was without success .
perhaps the unknow@@ ns were in fact close to the apartment or when they fled .
