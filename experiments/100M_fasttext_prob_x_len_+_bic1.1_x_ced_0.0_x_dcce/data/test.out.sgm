<seg id="1">Golfer Langer receives the pyramid of sports</seg>
<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Langer looked for a bit diversion with some colleagues with a ride on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was a premiere for the 58-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden sport pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">"after a few minutes, the horses remembered their holidays, they hunted at the fast gallop home to the feed-troughs."</seg>
<seg id="7">"one kilometer at this pace, I was afraid."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," "says Langer."</seg>
<seg id="9">And so the riding career then ended again.</seg>
<seg id="10">"on Saturday, Germany's best golfers of all time - 101 tournament victories - were again close to horses."</seg>
<seg id="11">"he let his family pass through the plant of the ALRV, and on a horse he didn't even snatch himself for photo purposes."</seg>
<seg id="12">Long was the first time in Aachen and thus also with the CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sports aid handed over to the man from Anhausen in the frame of a small gala the golden sport pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is no lack of awards for the sympathetic sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silver laurel leaf, Champions-Tour-Player of the year..."</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen had already blamed him.</seg>
<seg id="18">Long is the 18th prizewinner of the pyramid of sports.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Aachen, he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday."</seg>
<seg id="20">"this award means a lot to me," says Langer, "because she is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment."</seg>
<seg id="21">"for decades, Langer has been promoting the offspring."</seg>
<seg id="22">"and so he also gave the 25,000 Euro prize."</seg>
<seg id="23">"with 15 other outstanding sportsmen, the two-fold US master sieger was admitted to the Hall of Fame of German Sports on Saturday."</seg>
<seg id="24">"the athletes of Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the real Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Ruderer Peter-Michael Kolbe, der Judoka Frank Wieneke, the rider Alwin Schockembirle and posthumously the Handballer Erhard Wunderlich."</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of these sportsmen came to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after the official part, the illustrious company moved to the Springstadion, where the Lavazza price went."</seg>
<seg id="27">Bernhard Langer kept the distance from the big animals.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton's and Trumps Economic Policy Comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent trade agreements TTP - both Clinton and Trump want to prevent this.</seg>
<seg id="3">"however, the two US presidential candidates are in favour of tax and energy policy, as well as in a fundamental issue."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the difference in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, rather philosophical difference."</seg>
<seg id="5">On the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in doubt, Trump wants to keep it small and cautions how the state of the economy can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Clinton would like to tax the economy and regulate it to death," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="8">"he himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, says Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will make a massive return on regulations, and he is heavily involved in a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for companies."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton, on the other hand, said:" the state has certain tasks to fulfil, it has to open up disadvantaged opportunities and needs money for it. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"that is why taxes would be increased for the rich, they say."</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to the topic infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in the need to invest, Trump and Clinton are almost silent."</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate leaves the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state-critical shutters of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So on Trump we could still cross-party discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">Forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and to re-launch coal mining in the US.</seg>
<seg id="19">"oil extraction is also to be possible in so far protected areas, the Paris Climate Protection Agreement is intended to cancel."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Clinton, on the other hand, wants to explicitly expand renewable energies and demand:" a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"but not only in infrastructure, but also in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the transpazific trade agreement, do not want to sign both."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, both would not want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply better protect American jobs."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they should also be better paid, for instance, Clinton calls for."</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger strike.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must rush, then he says he must not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the coming months would probably be more likely to develop the fiscal policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand, Trump who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens wants to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">"his critics respect him, so the budget deficit would only be greater."</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand, Clinton, who wants at least from the rich wants to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are also not the solution."</seg>

<seg id="2">"sexual violence belongs to women who are fleeing alone, almost everyday."</seg>
<seg id="3">"when they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized."</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">Four women sit in a large kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each one has a baby that is at most one year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put her little son into his arms.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looks curiously into the room with big eyes.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother stares at the table-top.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until she notices that she is observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles and kisses the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene looks normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Talking to Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"she is the Managing Director of Condrobs, a sponsor of social services in Bavaria, and is among other things dealing with the topic of women on the run."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are refugees.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the north of Munich, they live in one of the few decentralized accommodation for single-die women and their children in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="17">In January Condrobs created the institution together with Pro Familia and the Munich Frauenhilfe.</seg>
<seg id="18">Recently it was officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">Men are not there - also not as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guard at the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who arrives here has had experiences with sexual violence on her escape," "says Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee because of wars because they are persecuted political because they threaten torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as hope bearers."</seg>
<seg id="24">"women outweigh other reasons for their escape:" "many steal away secretly, because they see no other way out."</seg>
<seg id="25">"in their homeland, they have had experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, honour killings, slavery or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">This is what drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">"on the flight, it goes on."</seg>
<seg id="28">"for example, that tugs are demanding a sexual act for a bottle of water," Bahr says. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"and the women are alone, they are not protected by their families."</seg>
<seg id="30">"who think that the end, as soon as they arrive in Germany, are irre, narrates Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="31">"even here, single women in refugee shelters would often be considered inferior and abused in the worst case."</seg>
<seg id="32">"this leads to the fact that about 90 per cent of women living in the housing in the north of Munich are traumatized, she estimates."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not born voluntarily."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are accustomed to say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they don't dare to talk openly about the experience, because the shame is too big."</seg>
<seg id="36">"since they often don't know how to help, I need more accommodations just for them, requires Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees."</seg>
<seg id="38">"on the question of whether they knew from a similar project as in Munich in their area of competence, some answers with no."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, there is no such thing in the housing of the governments."</seg>
<seg id="40">"even in Swabia alone, fled women are not housed separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesman of the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Upper Bavaria, Lower and Middle Franconia there are floors or own houses only for single women and their children in some community establishments."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Lower Bavaria, there are two main accommodations exclusively for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the" "Women's Rights and Gender Equality" "committee in the European Parliament also calls for women to be placed separately by men."</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study published for the committee, it says:" it is very important that men and women are accommodated separately. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"if the privacy is missing or will men and women be accommodated together, there can be - perpetual - violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"especially the washrooms should be separated and easily accessible for women, is available in the study."</seg>
<seg id="47">"how much the women feel this need of protection can be read on the rush, which is to be found on the house in Munich."</seg>
<seg id="48">"since we've talked about it, we have a long waiting list," "says Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="49">You could easily make a second home.</seg>

<seg id="2">Assistant doctors have called their union to approve new employment campaigns in their disputes with regard to a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called for its entire council to approve more work campaigns since the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">JDC said that it would have been given ministers to respond to concerns about the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in July, assistant doctors and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA."</seg>
<seg id="6">"he was rejected by 58% of his members, who voted in the elections."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in a letter to the members who was published on Twitter on Thursday evening, the chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government" persisted calmly "to problems, resulting in the agreement being rejected."</seg>
<seg id="8">"she said:" "considering this, the JDC Board agreed to completely reject the proposed new treaty and requested official new negotiations on all your concerns."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in response to the silence of the government, the JDC Board today issued a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve a running programme of escalating work combat activities that began in early September."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the disputes led to the fact that assistants of this year were quarrelling six times, the first overall failures in the history of the NHS."</seg>
<seg id="11">The head of the BMA resident Dr. Johann Malawana retired after the election to reject the agreed contractual conditions recommended by the BMA.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give themselves hands and to announce an official end of the eight month long war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I can not resist the impression that Ankara will most want this reconciliation."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was the handshake, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putin's smile seemed savallized, and he barely radiated warmth, even for his restrained circumstances."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke repeatedly of his" dear friend "Putin - according to a report all five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan has behaved as if nothing bad happened."</seg>
<seg id="11">"to me, his enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite."</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin's brilliant, sustainable cows showed that Russia's head of state had forgotten nothing."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the shot of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's response to the time was kindled.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin split and accused Ankara of having fallen into the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The crime was even greater as it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">To rebuild the uncle becomes difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months, the controlled media controlled a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">"most serious, the accusations of senior officials that Erdogan's own family benefited from illegal oil trading in Syria's Syria, controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He has vehemently denied this.</seg>
<seg id="23">"but in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look ahead."</seg>
<seg id="24">"after all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse that he wanted to hear from the President Erdogan."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">The advantages of a ceasefire are clear to Ankara on the hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the first place, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he has been relieved for almost his ministry during a failed coup d" état. "</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year."</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late-seasonal rush to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week, the state television endorsed cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Vedemosti expressed it as follows:" tourists there, tomatoes long. "</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious at the West because it considers its reaction to the attempted power grab as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in addition, the ongoing resentment about the snail tempo of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is keen to benefit from the cool atmosphere and to reduce Turkey's relationship to the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in Ankara, the Russian head of state gained a bonus that after the attempted coup d" état he demanded support for the chosen state organs. "</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep fear of regime change."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit in this brilliant palace at the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey to portray an" "alliance of outsiders" ": two countries that violate the West and feel bad and now fading."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently played a role as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents said at the press conference that they had not even stripped the topic."</seg>
<seg id="45">"Turkey's president deliberately avoided a question of their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize this."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and in the face of the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey shot down the Russian fighting jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State speak at least once again."</seg>

<seg id="6">"Anton Vaino, who has been deputy to Ivanovo since 2012, has been named his successor."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat."</seg>
<seg id="8">"born in Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in Tokyo."</seg>
<seg id="9">"on the Kremlin's website (in Russian), he later became the chief executive and staff leader of the government."</seg>
<seg id="10">"commenting on his appointment, he said to Putin:" thank you for your confidence. ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the government's main task to support your work as head of state regarding bills of law and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked him to leave his post and have recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Are the smiling faces convincing?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Sergei Ivanov was a long time one of Vladimir Putin's closest confidants, working as he did for Soviet intelligence, the KGB."</seg>
<seg id="16">"as a staff of staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country."</seg>
<seg id="17">"at a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigned on his own request."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but despite the smile for the cameras, there are only a few of them convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections."</seg>
<seg id="19">Is this the result of a sort of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion - that a man who was once promoted as a potential president - would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - met great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in his remarks to Putin cited on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said," It is true that I asked you in early 2012 in a conversation to give me this very complicated post - you could almost say - entrusting posts for four years. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"as it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential office for four years and eight months."</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the late 1990s, when Putin was Chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was named his deputy."</seg>
<seg id="28">"when Putin came to power, he called Ivanov one of five people whom he trusted most."</seg>
<seg id="29">"once it was believed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term, as a third term of Putin had violated the constitution."</seg>
<seg id="30">"but this post was taken by another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev."</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he was elected president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">"engineers have connected the North deck of the Queensferry crossings to the Viaduct, meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fife."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is the first of four closings of the" "ceiling blower", "which approach the completion by each of the three towers of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it has 10,000 metric tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 tilted ropes."</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister Keith Brown made a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said: "this is a historic and symbolic moment when building the Queensferry crossings.</seg>
<seg id="10">"we are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic degree in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="11">"despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for the fit."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in total, almost 79% of the total bridge deck is at its place and the last section of the deck is now available in Rosyth for the deck, meaning that the whole deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Michael Martin, Project Manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" the first closure is a significant milestone in every bridge project. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"in this fantastic project, the shutter represents future-proof high-end and civil engineering."</seg>
<seg id="15">"after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the extension of the northern tower, we had to close the gap in the north or country side."</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern Zucken Bridge 700 millimetres south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">"massive, as the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs approx. 6.000 tons and had to be pulled upwards with a slope of about 3%."</seg>

<seg id="1">Who is building favorable apartments in Braunschweig?</seg>
<seg id="2">The SPD and Green said: "in the future investors should be put a lot more seriously in the future."</seg>
<seg id="3">How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheaper apartments over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">The SPD is proposing a "housing concept" for the next council meeting.</seg>
<seg id="5">But strife is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">"first and foremost, it is about the question: who should actually build the cheap apartments?"</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"said S & D Group President Christoph Bratmann:" "we agree with the Greens: who wants to build on urban areas must in future evict 20 percent of all apartments as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="9">"however, the cheap apartments can also be created in the inventory."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, the great controversy in the town hall is, however, Bratmann:" how do you deal with investors who want to build on private land? "</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas, but as much as 20 percent of apartments as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="12">"a new urban residential construction project, which will cost millions and is still to be financed, should provide incentives for incentives."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the problem, according to Bratmann:" there is currently no agreement between the fractions. ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make investors as few regulations as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants even harder constraints for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">"despite this, as a violist, there is a sharpening of the situation on the housing market."</seg>
<seg id="17">"if the concept of action is implemented, it will take care of additional tasks in the construction administration."</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the programme is not yet complete, because the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but how does one reconcile the loss of further around 1300 cheap apartments, whose promotion is going to expire in the next few years?"</seg>
<seg id="22">"by 2020, it will be 500 apartments."</seg>
<seg id="23">"to prevent this from happening, the planning policy spokesperson Nicole Palm, should now be bought out bindings from the city."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in addition, it would have to be thought of getting the apartments back to the price relationship."</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">"in one fell swoop, the problem could be solved."</seg>
<seg id="27">For in the West stadt there are periods of time at the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price relationship for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only: this does not want the owners, the housing associations."</seg>
<seg id="30">"since the number of social housing in the western city is again drastically increased, one is removed from the goal of the so-called mixing."</seg>
<seg id="31">There is no more concentration of social weak in just a few parts of the city.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens expect there will be some movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"said S & D Group president Holger Herlitschke:" "for a broad majority, the CDU has to go into the boat."</seg>

<seg id="1">"Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness, worth it"</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">"teenagers and children are no longer going to play outside, but rather prefer to spend their free time staring on screens, has been lamented by many over the last decade."</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about bringing people away from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">"the time on the screen was initially limited to TV, then on videogames and last on smartphones."</seg>
<seg id="6">"therefore, it's great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other."</seg>
<seg id="7">"of course I am referring to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters that were initially created for the video games in the 1990s (later they created a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs)."</seg>
<seg id="8">"like many of the phenomena of pop culture, the interest in the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand declined in early July."</seg>
<seg id="9">Market launch in other countries was postponed due to the massive demand that overloaded the servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">"within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">"in short, players go out with their smartphones out and search for Pokémon, which are tracking with a GPS and once they have been found they can be" "photographed" "(via a screenshot on the mobile phone) or" captured. ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"a generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the train and jumped for the search of the sofa."</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the U.S., the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the" average "person withdraws every day."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, which pursues 35,000 users, recently told Washington Post that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of tracked people, who train every day 30 minutes, jumped 45 percent to 53 percent."</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays on Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data for improving performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"many public awareness campaigns for health, people want to take 30 minutes to get" "off the sofa" "and" "being active every day" "beat on deaf ears, because many public messages are boring for health and come from people who look elend."</seg>
<seg id="18">"however, the importance of sport cannot be overrated."</seg>
<seg id="19">"who regularly drives sport, reduces its chances of developing cancer or depression."</seg>
<seg id="20">"physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here."</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">"thus, three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close new friendships at the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">"as always, there are also gruesome game destroyers who always have to complain about something."</seg>
<seg id="25">"and yes, someone could run against a door."</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it be?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has become a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even if smartphone apps like Fitbit have already followed our activity earlier, they have no reason to do sports as it does this game."</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its charm and the use will decrease with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, due to Pokemons's success, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activist in the real world and help many people in the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier."</seg>

<seg id="13">"Bila is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a multi-campaign title and is the fifth, while consolidating its reputation to be the best of its generation or even at all."</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears as her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment ended.</seg>
<seg id="15">"this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes, such as Michael Phelps, who have brought their sports to new heights:"</seg>
<seg id="16">"Bila has won the sport for the last three years, 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Retton said she is" the best gymnast I've ever seen. ""</seg>
<seg id="17">"she expected her last examination in Brazil, a contest that did not so much between Billion and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations."</seg>

<seg id="28">"she took another 15,433 on the beam bar again - and with a 15,933 on the floor still sat on it."</seg>

<seg id="30">"the achievement of Raismans was revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place, but the bronze medal in a Tiebrake passed to Mustafina."</seg>
<seg id="31">"this time the 22-year-old female capitaine, which is called" "Grandma" "by the Americans, had a lead."</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to police reports, published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl killed in one of the most lethal attacks in the first mass murderous attack by Phoenix while they stopped in the car and listened to music."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on 12 June, while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the perpetrator fired eight shots from a hand-fire weapon, while he stood on the passenger side of the car and then fled to another vehicle, is read in the report."</seg>

<seg id="6">Phoenix's police spokesman Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investigators to take a closer look at whether it is associated with four previous attacks.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in total, seven people were killed predominantly in Hispanic homes within four months in nine attacks and two others were injured."</seg>

<seg id="1">"why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie"</seg>
<seg id="2">This is what I imagine under the women's olympic championship in gymnastics and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">"first, I have been involved in every summer Olympics since 1984 and the United States has never been so dominant."</seg>
<seg id="4">"second, this team has three gymnasts, Simone Bila, Gabby Douglas and Lauren" Laurie "Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin colour."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewess is and Madison Kocian who is Catholicine, makes everyone proud."</seg>
<seg id="6">This team is finally mirroring the USA.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in the last four years, the number one among female gymnastics was an Afro-American woman."</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">"during the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic champion and America cheered."</seg>
<seg id="12">"now the world was able to witness the incredible achievement of the three times world champion Simone Bila, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected, but masterful gynectic routines."</seg>
<seg id="13">"on Thursday, Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American who won gold at an individual multi-campaign event."</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">"we experience the peak of this sport, but so gymnastics in the whole country do not look."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Simone, Gabby and Laurie beat all the same way as Aly and Madison to make it into the olympic team."</seg>
<seg id="17">"they are the" "Last Five", "because the next Olympic team will have only four female gymnasts in the team. moreover, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but the reality is that gymnastics are an expensive sport and gymnasts primarily arise in private trainers, which are maintained by parents for training, training, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnasts and families)."</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these Turnstones are in prosperous suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in these clubs, the gymnasts get their entire training and that is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Bila, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, trained both her athletes since they started with gymnastics."</seg>
<seg id="22">"we have to be inspired by numerous young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a more affordable and accessible gym training."</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my TurnFoundation for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">"at my events, we offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youth (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international victors."</seg>
<seg id="25">"in September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer young people high-quality gymnastics, which deserve the opportunity to learn and profit from this great Olympic sport."</seg>
<seg id="26">"gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind."</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that will bring thousands of young girls to interest in gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">"it is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls."</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">"thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of" Girl Power "by the holding of the Olympic team golds and thank you, so many young girls with different backgrounds are motivated to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women."</seg>

<seg id="1">Political Correctness culture boosts election fraud in Muslim areas</seg>
<seg id="2">"the former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office for corruption last year, due to corruption."</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of political Correctness has led to widespread election fraud in Muslim communities by knowingly being ignored as a destructive government report today.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the former member of the Cabinet of Cabinet Sir Eric Picles verbally attacks the police, observers and town halls to have ignored evidence of election abuse due to" hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion. ""</seg>
<seg id="5">"the former minister of integration and communal government, who is now an Antinous King, said that the intimidation of voters from religious reasons would be so bad that the police were allowed to set up shut-off bands outside of the cabinet to protect frightened voters."</seg>
<seg id="6">"he recommends that voters should have an identity card, in order to prove their identity in elections."</seg>
<seg id="7">"at the moment, a voter has to name only his name and address."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the report proposes not to apply removable ink to the finger of a person if they release their voting voice, in order to prevent someone from choosing twice."</seg>
<seg id="9">Whistleblowers should get more protection says Sir Eric.</seg>
<seg id="10">It demands that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions of non-official committees or working groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this serves not only against electoral fraud, but also to protect the local government from the wider corruption and finance culture that comes with it," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was arranged by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlet's electoral scandals in the east of London.</seg>
<seg id="13">"last year, a special case decided that the current mayor Lutfur Rahman should be dismissed after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry."</seg>
<seg id="14">The court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "cynical" and that he had silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobia.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Rahman is said to have led" "his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">Up to 300 voices were either doubtful or the result of imitation in which one person was chosen as someone else.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud across the country."</seg>
<seg id="18">He expressed himself particularly alarming about the fraudulent letter choice - when the older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Sir Eric, depicted, made several recommendations to clean up the polling system, including guiding outs to prove the identity"</seg>
<seg id="20">"in his report it is said:" "evidence was made that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exercised, especially women and young people to vote in accordance with the will of the elderly, in particular communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi background."</seg>
<seg id="21">There have been concerns that... state institutions have knowingly ignored such a behavior because of "politically correct" interference with regard to ethnicity and religion.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system, including the prohibition that political activists are working on letter voting documents to stop" picking. ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The report commissioned by Theresa May requires tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral list being used for immigration and social fraud purposes.</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID.</seg>
<seg id="25">Do not remove removable ink on the finger of a person as soon as she has left her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice.</seg>
<seg id="26">Systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to ensure that they are eligible.</seg>
<seg id="27">A three-year limitation on applications for an automatic letter selection.</seg>
<seg id="28">Prohibition that political activists edit full post-elections and envelopes of letters.</seg>
<seg id="29">Police will give the authority to set up lockouts in order to set up polling stations.</seg>
<seg id="30">"a change in the law, which facilitates an indictment for intimidation in accordance with the" Representation of the People Act 1983 "(Legislative Decision 1983)."</seg>
<seg id="31">Shooting ban in polling stations.</seg>
<seg id="32">Requirement that only English can be used in the polling stations (except Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">"intensification of the training, to make sure employees generally enforce that voters go on their own in the election cabin."</seg>
<seg id="34">"Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it" "amazing" "that after Tower Hamlet case no criminal complaint was made."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the Electoral Tribunal declared lutary Rahman and his deputy for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices unsuitable," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="36">"due to a number of reasons, it was found guilty as a result of the high requirements in criminal proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="37">He also criticises the ineffective 'check checks' of the town halls' elective registry.</seg>
<seg id="38">"Sir Eric said," The court sentence in Tower Hamlets of last year was a warning signal. "</seg>
<seg id="39">"our country, as the mother of parliaments, bears a proud heritage, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation."</seg>

<seg id="2">"the world outside is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com could make it a bit safer for you."</seg>
<seg id="3">"we spoke to Rhone Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close distance."</seg>
<seg id="4">"regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from behind, this video will show you how to turn your skewer to the skewer."</seg>
<seg id="5">"if you get closer to you from behind, then you should first turn around, so that you can see your attacker and" go out of the line, "says Mizrachi."</seg>
<seg id="6">Then grab the weapon between your forearm and your shoulder before hitting your face with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">"then hit him with his knee in the bar and twist, while the attacker curbs before pain, the weapon out of his hands. hit him with the barrel in the face and move backwards while holding the weapon on him."</seg>
<seg id="8">"for attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the gun line, grab the gun and twist it so that the aggressor cannot shoot."</seg>
<seg id="9">"at the same time, store the weight on the weapon and beat the attacker on your chest, then turn the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and setting the weapon on it."</seg>
<seg id="10">Sounds difficult?</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveller Ian Wright chaps his tongue on the dirtiest places in Europe for a guide</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveller subdued his immune system and strangeness of a serious test - by licking out some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk dropped his course on one euro note, a banister at Piccadilly Circus, a sink of a tension toilet as well as a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"before removing any object, he used a Luminometer to show himself and to show us what he is going to get involved."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, which was filmed under the title" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "brought some surprising results to daylight."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought of emptying the rinsing button of a tension toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and healthcare professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"fortunately nothing he licked, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his bowel, traveling through the world and ate strange as well as wonderful things."</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public money to stations to rinse dumplings of toilets, the task assigned his immune system to a rehearsal"</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the film he said," As a child I was relatively unconcerned about what my health concerns and I have put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the film, he was justified in any case."</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">Its sample stroke showed a luminometric number of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"compared to this, the luminometric number of freshly washed hands is less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to lick after its luminometric number was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Wright and Finnish manufacturer of milk products Valio produced the travel film" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film he says," "This comes close to the worst thing I have geroed in a toilet."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirty than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not dock here because it is disgusting indoors.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">"the company provides Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the support of intestinal bacteria and immune systems."</seg>
<seg id="23">"valiant Senior Venice President for Snacks, Shafts and New categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" we really wanted to offer consumers something new. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We led crazy brainstorming that ended saying that we said "Let's call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of gut health and how it is associated with the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added:" let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he had checked out some of the things I need to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet, which is shown in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course, there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to lick them and others, in which this was quite difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty goodies on film.</seg>
<seg id="33">"in a survey conducted by Valio from 2015, 84 percent of all respondents reported lactic acid bacteria in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestines, and 58 percent said they use at least occasionally products containing added lactic acid bacteria."</seg>

<seg id="3">"Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her estate in Saltash, Cornwall."</seg>
<seg id="4">"after they were forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing association found property in an irreparable situation."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the walls had clad holes, wooden boards were torn up, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated to the walls."</seg>
<seg id="6">The family have been resettled and it is assumed that they are now living in private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">"Donna McEvoy, who works for the house administration at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid that the apartment could no longer be repaired."</seg>
<seg id="8">"she said," "It was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I think that people do not have to live in this way."</seg>
<seg id="9">"there are many things to consider, as this property will probably be seen as not as beautiful as Cornwalls."</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and their reputation is as well.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror which the family had inflicted on street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking, and excessive screams, disputes and flukes."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, got an arrangement for anti-social behaviour in June."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in some rooms of the house, which may be demolished under certain circumstances, old trash was found"</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the estate, where drugs were traded in the past, the wood floorboards were torn up."</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbors said they had to fight them on the street and to regularly invoked the police</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing made her and her partner violently by the estate this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="17">The delogiation was cheered by lightened neighbours who said that their lives were made hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">"one said," "They didn't care about anyone."</seg>
<seg id="19">We lived for 20 years along with them and it was always terrible.</seg>
<seg id="20">The countless times we the police say here are incredible.</seg>
<seg id="21">"this morning we could not sleep."</seg>
<seg id="22">We got up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it!</seg>
<seg id="23">"now, where they are finally away, it will be beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it had given the family to cooperate with the local authorities."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the family lived in the house, where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years."</seg>
<seg id="26">Trash and old toys were thrown down on the overgrown side of the community house</seg>
<seg id="27">"he added:" "it is a shame that the tenant is saying that it is the tenant to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and that of their family, since deloculation is always the last step to consider Cornwall Housing."</seg>
<seg id="28">"this was a very difficult case, as the behaviour was extreme and their deeds had to be awful for their neighbors."</seg>
<seg id="29">"I appreciate all the work my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and gave us the information."</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope this development will provide comfort to some neighbours and the message conveys that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20."</seg>
<seg id="32">A dirty mattress that is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after deloving on the ground</seg>
<seg id="33">"workers in the house administration will now have to remove garbage mountains, which surround the house"</seg>

<seg id="35">Skeldon received a fine after she found himself guilty of possession of a drug of class B in commercial intent.</seg>
<seg id="36">She claimed that the money for a tombstone of her son Lee Skeldon was born in 2013 in a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="37">"after they were homeless, they assumed that Tanya and their partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth."</seg>
<seg id="38">Many room walls of the house were covered with graffiti.</seg>
<seg id="39">The police say they will delegate renters who don't stick to the house rules</seg>
<seg id="40">Angela Crow from Devon and Cornwall police informed that delogic is a clear warning to the other renters who do not stick to the house rules.</seg>
<seg id="41">"this goes to those who think that they can behave without self-reproach and those who have been harmed by such conduct," "she said."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Kadiza Sultana, one of three British school girls who left London last year to join the IS, reportedly died in Syria."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said that a few weeks ago, her family learned about her death in Raqqa, Syria."</seg>
<seg id="4">"she was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air raid in Raqqa, the group's bulwark in the country, reported ITV news on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="5">Sultana was 17 years old and died after her family's information shortly after she had decided to leave the land-torn country and return to England.</seg>
<seg id="6">"one can only hope that the only good is in it - as a reminder and warning to others, that these are the risks connected to a war zone - to stop people from ever making that decision," "said Akunjee."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in February 2015, Sultana and two other school girls from the east of London got into a plane in the direction of Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border."</seg>
<seg id="8">Sultanas's family was told that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and within a few months she became a widow.</seg>

<seg id="2">"anyone who doesn't care and lodges Erdogan is sitting on packed suitcases," says the chairman of the Gülen-near Foundation Dialogue and World, Ercan Karakoyun. "</seg>
<seg id="3">Kurische commune Deutschland expects tens of thousands of protesters to flee from Turkey to Germany at short notice.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in the medium term it could even be" "some hundred thousand", "believes the president of the association Ali Toprak."</seg>
<seg id="5">"due to the hard drive of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan following the coup attempt, the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany."</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the short term, I reckon with tens of thousands, in the medium term with a few hundred thousand protectors from Turkey in Germany, if the Erdogan regime continues to fight minorities and the democratic opposition," says the president of Ali Toprak of the "World" from Friday. "</seg>
<seg id="7">"because the government had already covered Kurdish highburgers with impunity eight months ago, 500,000 Kurds were fleeing from Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="8">"according to the defeated putsch, secular and oppositional ethnic Turks are added."</seg>
<seg id="9">Many will want to restart in Europe if they are further suppressed in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="10">"it cannot be that a state that takes up refugees itself in the country's own country," "Toprak said."</seg>
<seg id="11">"the head of the Association lamented the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in Aladin cities."</seg>
<seg id="12">"with that, Erdogan wants to increase the exit pressure to the remaining Kurds."</seg>
<seg id="13">"they are the last big minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have been eradicated or driven out over the last hundred years," "said Toprak, who is also CDU member."</seg>
<seg id="14">The president of the Association demanded that the federal government positions itself "as sharp as Austria against Erdogan and his followers."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in Germany too, a" witch-hunt "takes place against Erdogan's critics."</seg>
<seg id="16">I don't feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last months.</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the natives get nothing from the summer campaign with - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in 2021, the Parliament elections will not resume directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year."</seg>
<seg id="5">"because stupid than so far it is not: summer holidays, heat and land elections - that bites."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the locals, who are to be persuaded by the ballot fighters, are on vacation."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most of the vacationers who are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so don't choose the country day."</seg>
<seg id="8">"there are practical problems: in the holidays helpers who hang posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and count on votes at the end, only rubbing hard."</seg>
<seg id="9">"until 4 September 2016, the day of the election and the last day of the holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is once again forced to pass by an election campaign against the people."</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase when you can say it at all has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">"and there is also something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, has to fear his office."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls."</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting is how strongly newcomer AfD cuts off and what remains at the end of the coalition dust.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 head of government, makes an almost unobtrusive election campaign."</seg>
<seg id="15">"he travels through the land, distributes roses and chatting a little with the people, as it did his legendary eloquent predecessor Harald Ringstorff."</seg>
<seg id="16">"otherwise, sailors have got cold feet and Merkel chancellor Merkel puts the blame on the blooming of AfD."</seg>
<seg id="17">"your refugee policy, you" We create that "has speeded up the rise of the right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the most beautiful ministry."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the CDU, with its Spitzenkandidaten, the Minister of the Interior, Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is, when at the wrong time one makes an election campaign at the right place."</seg>
<seg id="19">She has been invited twice Chancellor Angela Merkel to mega-climates; Merkel's parliament is in the north-east.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but the target group did not agree, there were more Nordrhein-Westfalen, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern."</seg>
<seg id="21">"there was probably the majority of other federal states," said Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, recently in NDR. "</seg>
<seg id="22">"but it's a shame not to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany, once Angela Merkel."</seg>
<seg id="23">"apart from that, the Nordost-CDU largely waives the usual election campaigns at market places and in front of shopping malls with parasols and balloons."</seg>
<seg id="24">"this, cocaert means, plays only a" subordinate role. ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Union has also noted that on the country you are brushing the base, that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people again."</seg>
<seg id="26">"it is like the left, the SPD, the Greens: barely there is in the sides of the country."</seg>
<seg id="27">"the Council of the CDU campaigner Kokert on his comrades is also self-exposing:" they have to go where it hurts, namely where the people are: village festivals, golden weddings, every birthday party has to be used. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"because much is on the game, Sellering has now called his SPD to a particularly committed campaign."</seg>
<seg id="29">"in polls, Socialists and Democrats were last at 22 per cent behind partners CDU (25) and just close to AfD (19)."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in the election of 2011, the SPD had still won 35.6 percent before the CDU (22)."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the Greens, the small party with seven percent in the polls, are likely to make the leap into the country's day."</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue out of their vacations and largely relocate their campaign to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"online campaign," he calls the chairman Claudia Müller. "</seg>
<seg id="34">"otherwise, green campaigners embark on search for domestic stimulants among holidaymakers."</seg>
<seg id="35">"Silke Gajek, the top candidate, just circulates with a houseboat through the Mecklenburg seas and finds it still beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="36">Your impression: "leave holiday in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment."</seg>

<seg id="1">B27 Restoration: restaurants suffer from blocking</seg>
<seg id="2">There is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="3">"for those responsible for the construction work, which start at 5.30am and end at about 8pm, there are all praise."</seg>
<seg id="4">"they have made it all pretty zaky," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet fuel station. "</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a super team.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is also no delay.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the construction site could be moved to the south at the beginning of the week as scheduled, by the end of October everything should be ready."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the opposite of those responsible for the construction work is also commended, for example when it comes to the establishment of makeshift drives."</seg>
<seg id="9">"since the construction site andered on Monday to the south and also the closure of the asphalt road in Ofterdingen has been reversed and thus the connection to Rottenburg is again, the traffic situation within the station has relaxed."</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now turn from the Ofterdingen from the B 27 on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">The evasive traffic through the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there were some significant complaints," says the deputy head manager Florian King, responsible for the technical management of the refurbishment. "</seg>
<seg id="13">"the residents of Bachstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many creeping paths were looking for and rather familiar with their navigation device than the signage."</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that some trucks were fraying in residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">"as the speed limits were not observed, the community also urged the measuring vehicle from Mössingen."</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were considerable excesses," "says King, who made himself informed about the situation."</seg>
<seg id="17">There are already two to three per minute heated.</seg>
<seg id="18">The fastest was on the way at 77 hours of hour in the Tempo-30 zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">"since the construction site has been moved, however, it has become quieter."</seg>
<seg id="20">For the businessmen at B 27 it is only a little consolation that for customers from Rottenburg the street is open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">"however, that the B 27 rehabilitation has led to sales collapses, everyone can look through."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, some are more and some less affected."</seg>
<seg id="24">"those who have less to do with the end customer, i.e. for other companies, have hardly any consequences for the renovation."</seg>
<seg id="25">"also at the Autohaus Maier Thomas Sulz talks about a" at most slight drop, "but also admits that" the running documentary is missing. ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The most heavily exploited are the bars along the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly crown, finds clear words."</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already existential.</seg>
<seg id="29">"not only him, but all the restaurants were" hard hit. ""</seg>
<seg id="30">"the customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil failed."</seg>
<seg id="31">We have to be happy about every euro turnover.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in terms of sales revenue, it increases to" far above 50 percent. ""</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "the street painting has thrown his business" "for two years."</seg>
<seg id="34">He had to leave half of his employees.</seg>
<seg id="35">"if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed, politics would have responded differently."</seg>
<seg id="36">"instead, President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request from Göhner whether there could be a financial compensation, with the hint that the restaurant benefited from the advantages of the situation on the B 27. now, it must also bear the disadvantages arising from the renovation."</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties where so much has been handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">"with all the complaints, Göhner is confident that his restaurant will continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="39">"after all, the family business has been here since 1715, and refers to the long history."</seg>
<seg id="40">"that other regulars now look less frequently because of the intricate traffic guidance, he can understand."</seg>
<seg id="41">"if you cannot go down, it is also very different."</seg>
<seg id="42">"at the end of the rehabilitation work, his family-klifts come back again, that is why Göhner has no doubts."</seg>
<seg id="43">"despite the crises of BSE and avian flu, Göhner sees the effects of the B 27 construction work on its clientele for the biggest crisis that has experienced its restaurant in its many years of history."</seg>
<seg id="44">"six months of construction, this is already brutal."</seg>

<seg id="9">I also participated in this.</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, as the Interior Minister, he was at the conclusion of the results and at a" "achievable consensus" "within the coalition."</seg>
<seg id="11">"after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, the Maizière has left a little time before he presents his conclusions for safety in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="12">But these are all the more extensive.</seg>
<seg id="13">"a lot is already known, announced, announced: that a new security authority should take care of the unencrypted communication, is not new."</seg>
<seg id="14">It is also not the fact that Germany must implement multiple EU directives on passenger data and weapons rights.</seg>
<seg id="15">The call for more video surveillance and staff for the security authorities is not surprising.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in part, de Maizière starts a second run for proposals not to be done with the SPD: he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and knock the jihadists with double nationality at the German passport."</seg>
<seg id="17">"these will be difficult points for the SPD," the CDU-man admits. "</seg>
<seg id="18">"he still holds this for reasonable and demanding nothing, which does not have any chances with the coalition partner anyway."</seg>
<seg id="19">A few new ideas also present de Maizière.</seg>
<seg id="20">They have partly in themselves: he is planning rapid procedures for deportations and more possibilities for detecting people from deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees who are targeted in the country should first check their smartphones and disclose social media accounts for a security check.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in case of tolerances for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some worse than previously - such as committing crimes or throw away their papers deliberately in order to disguise their identity."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of them are politically and legally sensitive.</seg>
<seg id="24">Many also have an unexploded effect and leaves questions open.</seg>
<seg id="25">"and at some points, in the unequal treatment of patient, for example, the question arises: what does this have to do with security and terror?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the subjects of refugees and terror."</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be said that the assassins of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">"in addition, many people worried about security in the face of the high number of refugees."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and things that deeply concern people, could not be stapled even in election campaign times."</seg>
<seg id="30">The inner security is enormously concentrated.</seg>
<seg id="31">"first the attacks in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice."</seg>
<seg id="32">Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">The uncertainty is great.</seg>
<seg id="34">"and yes, there are electoral struggles."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Union and the SPD are therefore becoming increasingly in their position on the subject of internal security.</seg>
<seg id="36">"in the past few days, there was a high rate between the two parties."</seg>
<seg id="37">"only a garrisome quarrel on the equipment of the Federal Police, then a security policy collection of some Unions Interior Minister, in which the resentarians also demand a Burka ban and a return from the dual citizenship."</seg>
<seg id="38">De Maizière is also struggling here for conciliatory sounds.</seg>
<seg id="39">"from a departure from the double-pass, he doesn't hold anything."</seg>
<seg id="40">We have made an extension of the discussion in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="41">To replenish them is not sensible.</seg>
<seg id="42">"and in case of a Burka ban, he has constitutional objections."</seg>

<seg id="9">"in Western Europe alone, China's second most important market, sales were 14 percent lower than in the previous year."</seg>
<seg id="10">"in Germany, the deliveries outwardly sacked almost one sixth."</seg>
<seg id="11">"head of the brand, Jürgen Stackmann, boosted the weaker figures from July mainly on two sales days less in Europe."</seg>

<seg id="14">"in the USA, where the exhaust-gas-affinities first escalated, a minus is also to be found."</seg>
<seg id="15">Great support for VW is the Chinese market.</seg>

<seg id="17">Group sales manager Fred Kappler continued to show a sales increase from January to July.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time, 5,904 million worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="19">Volkswagen had tampered with a software exhaust gas testing.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in Germany alone, VW is calling around 2.5 million vehicles to retrofit into the workshops."</seg>
<seg id="21">"as part of the conversion, VW reiterated that the conversion of cars has no negative effects."</seg>

<seg id="23">"after the conversion, the car manufacturer will issue a" guaranteed "certificate, but don't speak of a" guarantee "as it was said on Friday in corporate travel."</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who actually buys records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle aged love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">"before you come to the comment section, to rip it under the pseudonym non Allemonalities male middle age with harsh insults, this statement deduces from current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the reemergence of records does not affect a boom in Millennials, who want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to Midlife-nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all foresight at the age of 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers."</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no hordes through hobbies - it has an emotional impact: older plate buyers retain their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending alone time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you agree with the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog is a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, taking a modest gray suit and stacking wild before I stop, hold my hands and say something better than:" so, let's take a closer look at it. "</seg>
<seg id="10">"so, let's take a look at it."</seg>
<seg id="11">"even if the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record stores."</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I chose from Sister Ray (Number of Files: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (Number of data: eight middle-aged men, a woman, probably around the 20), is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">"is he a collector, I ask?"</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 panels."</seg>
<seg id="17">"these records, shown above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him home), dress the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they appeared and buy again items he sold when he was young and broke."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late sixties, early 70's who appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I probably were too young to buy them," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees that those who buy records are more introverted and would like to spend time alone, and add:" I don't smoke and I don't drink very much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">"25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers, whom he meets, apply to the YouGov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"he also noticed a new wave of people, who are influenced by the media, people who have heard about the comeback and have set themselves to buy their old records."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from the conversations I have conducted, people tend to get rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of trailers of the record revivals of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the supposed emotional significance of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a shop like Phonica to realize that plate shops offer a calming community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to Wez, some of the older customers participated in the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar gramophone records, from objects that evoke happy memories."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the filling of a emptiness or possession of material possessions as a kind of consolation," Wez says. "</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way of dealing mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "we are like their social workers!" "a staff whispers from a stack."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a survey by the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month, have not yet heard them."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record, have no record player."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at this time of the news report, I would probably look very worried, while I was browsing through a pile of Bossa Nova compilations."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Number of data: three middle-aged men), has noticed a" "trophy aspect" "of the revival."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came in just recently and said," "I don't have a record player, but I would like to buy a Radiohead disc so I can put them on the shelf", "he says."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens."</seg>
<seg id="41">"more productive, less music-grade."</seg>
<seg id="42">"we have people who say," I don't have a record player. ""</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not older ones, who come in only slowly."</seg>
<seg id="44">"Fopp, which has devoted the records to almost a whole floor, has a blower audience when I go in."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women."</seg>
<seg id="46">Even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts is the latest synthesizer and sextpacked pop instead of experimental jazz from the loudspeakers - it's good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them looks odd, but their psychological trauma is hard to imagine when standing next to someone for 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, has been running around the store for a few minutes and considers the variety of plates available for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">It makes more a window-shopping than a big shopping.</seg>
<seg id="50">"it doesn't earn much, so collecting records is not a real option, she says."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it is easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of records is..." she drives off with a dearest sigh. "</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I pretending to muzzle the jeans for the jeans, I watch a group of young teenage girls who are grouped around for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and daughter consider buying a Crosley record player."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left there is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"no one sees them - perhaps because they are only purely decorative, some so far up that it is impossible to touch them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "plate art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that every attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and some customers could send in the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain."</seg>
<seg id="60">"it is no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even if my research shows that the results of YouGov agree, at least in record shops in Soho, the large number of female collectors, who exist in reality, record shops and online forums, are not considered."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they spend their Thursday morning with safety not by strolling through plate shops of Berwick Street and the leaves through plates, while they steer clear of the starving look of an uncanny, 30-year-old false presenter who stands above the shoulders of a middle-aged man."</seg>

<seg id="2">"a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Calais jungle where thousands of refugees live."</seg>
<seg id="3">"during a trial hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be able to sell 72 temporary shops where people within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energydrinks, sell, barber services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the prefecture of Calais argued that these places were to be demolished because they would represent a parallel economy, from which no taxes would be paid and that carry a fire and health risk."</seg>
<seg id="5">"humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important, as the free meals offered by the state-supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="6">They also assumed that the temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">"a court in Lille ruled that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people operating the 72 temporary shops, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were" absolutely comprehensible. ""</seg>
<seg id="8">"judge Jean-François Molla said that food stores, cafés and restaurants would play a much larger role than merely feeding people living in extremely precarious conditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas provide quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">"one of the places that was threatened by the tearing was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is operated by charity and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum applications for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="11">"more than 170,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the kids' café."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in a letter to the Guardian, it was said that the closure was" for these children of a catastrophe, of which the youngest eight years are old. ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"the two relief organisations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of Migrants in the jungle rose to more than 9,000 people - the highest number until now - following a steep increase in new arrivals during the summer."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Britain's impressive performance with 7-year-old Rugby came to an abrupt halt at the final hurdle in the form of Fijis, when they were beaten here in Rio with a result of 43-7 at the San Teodoro stage."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Fiji shared a master class in Handling, Side-Stepping, back-back, line run, and raw power to win gold - its first Olympic version of any color."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the defeat was crushed by the not too bad price of the silver medal - Great Britain was fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semifinals the same day, could fall back to them in the final."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but regardless of this, a 15-man team emerged in the form of a 15-man team."</seg>
<seg id="7">"it might be a consolation for GB - but it will probably not - that at least a Briton tomorrow will have a gold medal to hang around his neck: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon."</seg>

<seg id="9">"eight years ago, they lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens under Ryan."</seg>

<seg id="14">"with four minutes of playing time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner, which he converted."</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.</seg>

<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou presided over further weak tacklings of the GB team and stormed down to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.</seg>

<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">"GB led fundamental changes to the half-time and closed the fijian gap... for entire four minutes, which was good for the circumstances of the first half-time until Joshua went through Tuisova after a brilliant intermediate play of Fiji."</seg>

<seg id="2">The crisis-packed and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared from additional costs in millions of dollars.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens that threatened the industry from green electricity subsidies are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the Federal Minister Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the" "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" "(WAZ, free-day edition) will remain at the release of the Renewable Energy Transition in the German steel industry."</seg>
<seg id="5">I am really happy that we could finally achieve this after two years of tough negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="6">"the European Commission, therefore, had planned to ask the steel producers to use the gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption to the cash register."</seg>
<seg id="7">"according to German industry associations, the steel industry threatened to cut additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Gabriel told the WAZ, there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager."</seg>
<seg id="9">Only when the generators are replaced in the steel works fall an EEG levy of 20 percent.</seg>
<seg id="10">But even these are not raised in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">The IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the European Commission on self-electricity production.</seg>
<seg id="12">This will largely determine the status quo of the current regulation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Gabriel's successful endeavor for the steel industry is of particular importance.</seg>
<seg id="14">"with regard to our campaign 'Steel is future', this is a first step."</seg>
<seg id="15">"others must follow."</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "climate and employment targets are also to be weighed in the reform of emission rights law," "stated Jörg Hofmann, head of Metall, in Frankfurt."</seg>
<seg id="17">"since the financial crisis in 2008, the steel industry in Europe suffers from overcapacity and considerable price pressure."</seg>
<seg id="18">"last year, the situation escalated further, when the world's largest producer of growers threw steel onto the world market in view of the weakening domestic demand."</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers reject price dumping Chinese steel concertos.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the course of this spring, the situation has eased a bit."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on the one hand, imposed import duties on import steel have an effect, on the other the economic prospects in China have brightened up."</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how sustainable the price pick-up is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry primus Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">"last but not least, the prices would have been rather stagnating."</seg>
<seg id="25">The sector is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">"in doing so, ThyssenKrupp did not want to exclude the closing of individual works."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the German steel industry, around 86,000 people were employed at the end of 2015."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in July, the German steel producers are cautious in spite of rising prices and increasing orders."</seg>
<seg id="29">"at 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year's month, as the Steel Community announced on Friday."</seg>

<seg id="1">"community, spirit, health: singing is good for seniors"</seg>
<seg id="2">"the singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp for her whole life: as a young girl she was in school choir, she attended the college degree, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors choir."</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes. "</seg>
<seg id="4">"after a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and more alive, she says."</seg>
<seg id="5">"by the way, she does something good for her health and her mind."</seg>
<seg id="6">"from several perspectives singing is a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler from the German senior league."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like-minded people, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="8">"by regular meetings, seniors can socialize and cultivate social contacts."</seg>
<seg id="9">"because often social and family structures dissolve in old age, a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" to arrange and organize, to be able to rely on others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together. ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"singing can be exhausting in a positive sense, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="12">"for this, seniors train a deep and controlled respiration."</seg>
<seg id="13">"who regularly asks his lungs, does not get out of the puffs so quickly in everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="14">"even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice at age, singing is an optimal hobby."</seg>
<seg id="15">"for older people, Singen often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Labour Association of Senior Citizens."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the older generations shared singing had a much higher priority, it belonged to everyday life, both at school and in leisure time, she explains."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Lenz often observes that singing or listening of songs in older people awakens many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth."</seg>
<seg id="18">"through lyrics and especially melodies, even dementia-sick people decelerate to long-lying events."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in singing, a special achievement is required to the head, explains Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, focus on one's own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge."</seg>
<seg id="21">"just elderly people who live alone are doing so, not just concentrating on themselves."</seg>
<seg id="22">"another positive aspect is the recognition you hear through singing in the chorus, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Self-esteem increases through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">"to show yourself: when I practise for something for a long time, I will be better and waving beyond me - this experience strengthens."</seg>
<seg id="26">"good reasons to start singing, there is enough."</seg>
<seg id="27">"who wants to try out a new hobby, should not hesitate, even if he thinks little talent, advises Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="28">"you don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears when a sound goes wrong?"</seg>
<seg id="29">"in search of the right offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="30">"if someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a senior's choir, you can simply join them."</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer views over the choirs in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in an ecclesiastical choir can contact the church or the church leader directly.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">"who does not have access to the Internet, can ask the family, friends or neighbours for help with internet research."</seg>
<seg id="35">"if you want to sing, you should definitely join a choir, advises Mr. Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - that applies to all ages.</seg>

<seg id="17">We assume that it is a coordinated attack.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it is too early to express themselves about possible motives, but probably it is about the actions of Muslim rebels."</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to see a sample typical of the bombing of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the Thai police, on the other hand, stated that the attacks were not in connection with the Islamist uprising or with international terrorism."</seg>

<seg id="12">That would be Islamists as well as right-wing extremists.</seg>
<seg id="13">This is not an embarrassing advertisement for one's own cause.</seg>
<seg id="14">Propaganda is meant to appeal to people emotionally.</seg>
<seg id="15">Young people are particularly vulnerable.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="17">"last but not least, there have been reports from several federal states about contacts of the" Identitären "to AfD politicians."</seg>
<seg id="18">Maate said that he had no knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for the constitutional protection, potential contacts of this species are only relevant from a certain point."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it depends on whether the party - in this case - the AfD - by certain persons, who are extremist, change their direction and become so extremist."</seg>
<seg id="21">The decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party.</seg>
<seg id="22">This shall not be discernable.</seg>
<seg id="23">"with a view of the significant increase in legitimate offences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee camps, Maate said that he would not speak of new right terrorism in this regard."</seg>
<seg id="24">But we have seen in recent years that there can be right-wing terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="25">There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freital Group.</seg>
<seg id="26">"it may well be that other right-wing groups form groups or small groups that plan attacks against asylum seekers, against refugee homes or attacks from other right-wing extremist motives."</seg>
<seg id="27">"a nationwide or pan-European control of right-wing terrorism, however, is not recognizable."</seg>
<seg id="28">The previous groups were created at the regional level or in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="29">"worried about the fact that many assaults came to the account of people, who had previously not appeared in the right scene."</seg>
<seg id="30">This is worrying.</seg>
<seg id="31">"many of the suspects of attacks on asylum lodgings had previously not been known as criminals, politically motivated offenders or supporters of the right scene."</seg>
<seg id="32">"many people have thus committed crimes which had previously had nothing to do with right-wing extremists, which might have been politically indifferent or elected for example, CDU, SPD or Left, which have, however, radicalised by right-wing extremist mood."</seg>

<seg id="8">But it was rather his not just sporty character that attracted the attention of the international media.</seg>

<seg id="10">The Ethiopian received a special start right from the international swimming association.</seg>

<seg id="16">"referring to a" "prosperity bump", "the English tabloid" The Sun "with" Dad Bod "made fun of him."</seg>
<seg id="17">"his time, he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds about the 100 m freestyle, played no role."</seg>
<seg id="18">Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.</seg>
<seg id="19">"during the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Eric Moussambani took care of media attention."</seg>
<seg id="20">"unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to ride alone in a pre-run over 100 meters of freestyle."</seg>
<seg id="21">"frenetically, Moussambani was fired back then."</seg>

<seg id="1">"as of October 1st, 2016, the fees per cubic meter of sewage amounts to the area of the sanitation plant Neudorf / Reuth / Welsch 3,44 instead of 2.10 euros; for Zultenberg / Lindenberg / Lopper 3.36 Euro (until now 2.26 euros) and for Azore 3.64 Euro (until now 2.18 Euro)."</seg>
<seg id="2">"at the facility in Azendorf, the wastewater fee will increase at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary."</seg>
<seg id="3">"after a high-quality calculation, the sewer rate in Azore will then reach 4.37 euros per cubic meter."</seg>
<seg id="4">"as Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, in the approval of the budget by the District Council Kulmbach, it was established that undercovers for these wastewater facilities were running."</seg>
<seg id="5">"due to legal bases, the market of Kasendorf is obliged to operate the systems with cost-covering."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as of October 1, 2016, citizens and industrial companies from Welsh, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopez, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to go deeper into the purse."</seg>
<seg id="7">The fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">"as Managing Director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the Board, a new calculation of the fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- and undercovers from the previous calculation period may also be compensated."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Schmidt founded the serious fee increases with the fact that all three sewage plants handle relatively small facilities with a very low waste water fall, which flows between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year."</seg>
<seg id="11">"as a result of the low distribution of distribution, expenses for necessary repairs would have a serious impact on several thousand euros."</seg>
<seg id="12">Forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change.</seg>
<seg id="13">"furthermore, due to their age refurbishment and repair expenses, in the back-lying calculation period, not least due to their age refurbishment and repair expenses were incurred to a considerable extent."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the facility in Azore is nearly 30 years old, the facilities for Welsh, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopez almost 20 years."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Schmidt noted that in the Azendorf sewage plant, the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced by a damage."</seg>
<seg id="16">"after nearly 20 years of operation, the first sewage sludge had to be excavated, the sewage sludge disposed of and an additional ventilation facility had to be installed in order to meet the water legal requirements in the future."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Schmidt:" these extraordinary expenses came into account with the continued assistance and maintenance costs, which must be taken into account in the new calculation period. "</seg>
<seg id="18">"the same applies to electricity costs, which are still clearly below the current level during the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012."</seg>
<seg id="19">Stone houses made it clear that in the three plants the cost of operation and maintenance in the three facilities was fully operational.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the past 20 years, Schmidt, the market congregation of large entertainment costs, has been spared in the sewer systems in the past 20 years."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in the view of stone houses, the situation for the aforementioned plants will remain precarious in the long term, especially since the supply area of the Friesenbachtal Sealing Association could not be extended because it is a lack of facilities."</seg>

<seg id="2">"snapchat states that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is unaware of races."</seg>
<seg id="3">"with its filtering tool, snapshots enable about 150 million everyday users to change the reality and play identities in such a way that borders on the absurd."</seg>
<seg id="4">"you can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the filters are non-bloated, proprietary rotary tools that produce more than 30 million enhanced selfies per day."</seg>
<seg id="6">All the mistakes are made to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in the past, snapchat filters have been criticized in the past where they were accused of using the app Blackface promoted or white skin as beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when this week a few users suggested a filter that gave them slit eyes, false teeth and bloated cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians -" "yellowish-face." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">They asked themselves if this repeated controversies pointed to a greater problem that the company has a diversity of diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">"the news and outrage were widely distributed on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat announced that it had turned off the feature."</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was intended to tribute to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but outsiders who have experienced racism, the filter reminded of injurious clichés."</seg>

<seg id="15">She added that "it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very contradictory Asian caricature and filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">"it shows that the filter is not backed-up, but that the yellow-face was drawn into the throaty extreme."</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapshot is not the only company that crosses this cultural stumbling block.</seg>

<seg id="20">"if one of the snapshots creates a picture that is offensive to a user," "it is much more difficult that such things stay unnoticed than it was in the past," "said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on Thursday, Zhu, who worked as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and asked others to do the same."</seg>

<seg id="2">"military personnel of the United States Central Command have changed intelligence intelligence in order to draw an optimistic view of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, as it allowed the actual conditions on the ground to report an investigation committee of the Congress in a report on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the provisional report created by a Task Force of the Republican Members of the Committee of Defense, Secret Service Committees and the Military Vehicle Committee reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command Intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="4">"central Command, shortly Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia."</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence service, typically evoked by high-ranking CentCom commanders, posted a positive image of the American efforts against terrorism when it allowed the actual conditions on site and were more positive than analysis of other intelligence services," a newspaper article cited the report. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," "said Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives."</seg>
<seg id="7">The management errors in the CentCom range to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American strains in the training of Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">"although there are no direct indications that government tips have given statements under Obama to change reports, it shows how analysts were exposed to pressure from their superiors to draw an optimistic view of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL."</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before the Congress were much more positive than the facts" provided the report. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"for example, a CentCom affiliate publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossules could begin in April or May 2015."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Mossul, second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigation, it's so clear." "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement."</seg>
<seg id="14">"from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, Central Command's leaders changed intelligence reports to reduce the danger of ISIS in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force in life after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings while the investigations continue.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in addition, further investigations of CentCom are underway by the Chief Inspector of the Department of Defense."</seg>
<seg id="18">"on Thursday, democratic members of the Intelligence Committee released their own findings, which coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015 CentCom created an overly restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi security services," announced the highest-level Demokrat in the committee, member of the Adam B. Ship House of Representatives, in a statement. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"this process, Mr. Schiff," delayed the publication of intelligence reports, "shamed the morals under analysts and" gave too little room for dissenting opinions. ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no indication of any intervention of the White House at the CentCom analysts with regard to a "specific political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the Congress's investigations were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">"last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon General inspector, who received complaints from CentCom analysts."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the Congress, while the Inspector's investigations are still underway."</seg>
<seg id="25">"but he also admitted that" experts sometimes have diverging opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence. ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have further effects on the question of a successful air campaign under US leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">"however, the allegations of the previous year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State reminds of differences of more than ten years ago when a Centcom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a piece about how the then government under George W. Bush foresaw only a small occupying troops in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the 2003 invasion."</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">"last year, the team headed by Mr. Hooker determines government officials that contrary to the statements made by the government, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State have no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, since these temporary refineries have been put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market."</seg>
<seg id="31">"this recognition, however, was not published, the Times reported in September."</seg>
<seg id="32">"Centcoms damaliger Command, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature for his excessive positive assessment of the situation at a hearing before the Senate."</seg>

<seg id="3">"five goals in two games should actually be a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she couldn't remember that ever done."</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I don't belong to the people who remember their goals.</seg>
<seg id="6">"however, they know: the Americans are at the Olympic competition at 4-0 and they are equal in their group with the Britons in the first place, which after their 2-0 victory against Japan remain undefeated."</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">"both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams."</seg>
<seg id="9">The first place will take the strong Dutch woman slightly longer from the path that the other group will lead.</seg>
<seg id="10">"as always the game may go out on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising turbulence by their success story, four years after they landed in the past London games on the last of 12 places."</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">"she grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey racket in hands (her two older sisters played sports at the Drexel University), with 16 years she became the national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team."</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the 2008 Olympics because she couldn't qualify for the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012 when everything went wrong for her and her team.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in the following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, became the coach of the National Team and thus began to turn things to a better."</seg>
<seg id="16">"a change of culture, mental change and physical change," Bam said. "</seg>
<seg id="17">We didn't have the workstation in London that we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have been able to rob the rudder completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the door in the first half of the game with a backstroke from the near area.</seg>
<seg id="20">"India had gone into the game without a win in the tournament, but the team showed itself surprisingly tough and held the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands."</seg>
<seg id="21">"she performed a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved to the center and knocked the ball into the gate to get the American female a 2-0 lead."</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">"the Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the keeper of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who had previously had to book a goal in each of the previous games."</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position," said Parnham, but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday. "</seg>

<seg id="1">"in the midst of the age of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline"</seg>
<seg id="2">"wherever you are, as late as it is, it is the Olympics."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Rio de Janeiro's events feel constant and inevitable, a raging relay between competition and aspiration."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which is passed from the wristwatch to the swimmers to the triathlete."</seg>
<seg id="5">"you can't turn off the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the store, without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women's black with dimples, could well have been built among these familiar names, which would be sent to Prime Time by sponsors and well-being TV ads when he would be a swimmers, gymnasts or even fencers."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights at Olympic trampolines around gold."</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not immediately illuminate every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the centre, partly in the shadow are the sports that are not generally accepted: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast-swim and may it reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I should make more modest arguments for my particular darling, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it was so sparsely perceived the last 16 years that many of them that I had asked didn't know that it was an Olympic sport altogether."</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"although the USA sent athletes for competition, it has never won a medal in trampoline jumping and had an athlete until 2012 who made it to the final round."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">"jumping on the trampoline has some exterior charme, partly because it sounds more suitable for a clownsschool than those for the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point I should admit, that I am not an expert, but just an earth bound enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has humoristic potential - the cartoonish trembling of his never-ending impact, but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports which essentially unite."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the word" "trampoline" "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline which means" springboard. ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"emerging conquerors jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a series of falling movements (turning, pike and saltos) before they land on their feet."</seg>
<seg id="23">"according to the official Olympic programme, they are rated according to performance, difficulty and" flight time. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">"medalists have to go further, faster, up and down in their quest for gold, sometimes up to the goal, sometimes up and down, up and down at the playground."</seg>
<seg id="27">"they hunt not only the finish line or the pretext, but also another highlight in television coverage: the world or the Olympiapet."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the goal-oriented aspiration is nobel, admirable, even fanatical - and it is enough to even stir a spectator to tears."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I feel tiresome when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">"he or she stops, seemingly weightlessly like an astronaut, goes up, then downwards, then effortlessly back up."</seg>
<seg id="34">"here too there is competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant suspension of time and gravity."</seg>
<seg id="35">It is so Zen as the competition can only be at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the qualification and final rounds of the women will be held on Friday afternoon, in the stream at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00."</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the final accounts as part of a mid-afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in the heart of the Olympia-Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in the general turmoil."</seg>
<seg id="39">"when the increasing awareness of consciousness can only be achieved through the anxieties and the objectivity of male athletes - as the male U.S. gymnasts recently proposed to the Wall Street Journal, Mr. Dooley anticipates his new fan base."</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protested" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the USA "</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators calling for political changes in Ethiopia clashed with government violent resistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that dozens of protesters were killed during clashes with the police during shot changes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just going to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the last ten years, it was one of Africa's most stable countries, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">"but in recent months, protests against the government shook the country and expanded into more and more areas."</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"according to human rights organizations, the government's response was relentless."</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that policemen shot and killed in dozens of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the videos being circulating about the protests, which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security professionals strike young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a handstand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN authority for human rights now demands a detailed investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa, the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiopians to combat terror attacks across the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much Western aid."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a respectable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the roads are usually quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been limited, with dissidents effective silence."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent into exile or in prison, killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you oppress people and do not have any other options except to protest, it breaks out," "said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous ailments covering everything from land use to stranglehold regarding power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"following a widely criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies got the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 per cent of the Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, tensions continue along the Eritrea border; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June."</seg>
<seg id="28">"analysts fear that separatists like the Oromo-Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which were more or less forced in recent years, could exploit the turbulence and be able to arm themselves again."</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of thinking under the surface are now exploding.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only in recent years, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with the social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more and more frequent and the internet services improved."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do at regular intervals, especially at protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxies that hide where they are."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians gave up that they were so close together.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oroms and Amharas, the two biggest ethnic groups in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Orosei and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"for eons, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia predominantly Christian highlands, prospered in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in lowland areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But this is also changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are to co-ordinate under a screen," "said Mulatu Miechu, a leader of the Orosei."</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Orosei.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray who constitute about 6 per cent of the population and dominant in the military, secret services, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was the prime minister of Ethiopia until his death in 2012 for 17 years."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was especially versed in perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime lacks this basic skill," "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst."</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively inscrutable reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the South."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services monitored by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time Ethiopia experienced such a turmoil in 2005, after thousands protest against elections, apparently slipped by the government, and subsequently stolen."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the ensuing raids, many protesters were killed even if they were less than in the last months and this time of unrest went relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in fighting poverty."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the Ethiopian government's internal abnormality.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it assumes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month protesters in Gondar, an ampersone city, led by Tigray, and the hatred of the Tigray is becoming more common in the social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflug over neighboring Somalia, even if it recently shared that it has closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile region."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," said Mr Abdi, "is a very thin tightrope walk."</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his assertion Obama had founded ISIS was "sarcasm."</seg>
<seg id="2">"Donald J. Trump tried to dissipate the last controversy surrounding his campaign, fearing that his repeated assertion, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would be the" founders "of the terrorist group Islamic State, not serious."</seg>
<seg id="3">"this clarification raised new questions about the communication skills of the Republican presidential candidate, whether he was able to communicate clearly and understandably to the American public."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it also brings along its comrades who endeavour to take protection during an eventful period, into the peculiar position of explaining statements that he could not have meant."</seg>
<seg id="5">"having made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump drew back with reference to the allegation on Thursday, and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but in an early morning Tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the Tweet was contrary to the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he said the accusation was completely serious."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when the conservative Radiomorator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to help him weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know anything about it."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the last storm of criticism pervades Mr. Trump, trying to direct the focus of his campaign due to falling demand values on the economic situation."</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">"on Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this topic again."</seg>
<seg id="12">"using Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her talk boring."</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already advanced sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">"at the end of July, he criticised himself when he thought that the Russians should hack Clinton's emails but later on" Of course, "I said," Of course, I thought the sarcastic. ""</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone linguistic boundaries in politics and then back to demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans, how they arrive, and then possibly" clarify "depending on how the reaction fails." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who monitors the language of both candidates. "</seg>
<seg id="17">"but I also believe that he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough, so that they can be interpreted in different ways."</seg>
<seg id="18">"instead of defusing the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has assumed an even more etched tone as his survey values have gone further."</seg>
<seg id="19">"a new survey by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was published on Friday, showed a leading lead in North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida."</seg>
<seg id="20">"while Mr. Trump is generally trying not to apologize for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humour."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but as he emphasises in the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze brought his loyalist comrades into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how provocative his statements may be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps's most prominent advocates, made great efforts to defend the candidate in a CNN interview from Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," Mr. Giuliani told him about the correctness of Mr. Trumps's statements asked if Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"it is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them backers, completely false, and that is why it happened because he drew the troops out of Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most mainstream republicans are trying to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to spread the situation in the Middle East aggressively under control."</seg>
<seg id="26">"before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of going around on each of his words and being prejudiced against him."</seg>
<seg id="27">"he ridiculed the poor, miserable" television experts who try to understand him and said, "You can't!." "</seg>

<seg id="8">"a revitalized verb cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the new owner of Verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the old cafe, the owner and managing director of the new cafe."</seg>
<seg id="12">He started working at Verb in 2001 and remained there until the end.</seg>

<seg id="20">There are natural circuit keys.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the café does not serve any beer, but there are fresh juices."</seg>
<seg id="22">After nine months Rodriguez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.</seg>
<seg id="23">"many old customers were also displaced by prices from Williamsburg," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"recently on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer."</seg>

<seg id="2">"in March 1933, shortly after his climb to the President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office."</seg>
<seg id="3">"as a gourmet, President Roosevelt had a passion for refined delicatessen of Fifth Avenue like Pâte de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup."</seg>
<seg id="4">"his menu on that day was a little more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes, and dessert a plum pudding."</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," "said Jane Ziegelman."</seg>
<seg id="6">"her husband Andrew Coe added," "There was also a message to the Americans as they should eat."</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the last book" "Chop Suey" "was from Chinese cuisine in the U.S. while Ziegelman told in her book" "97 Orchard" "about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from the food perspective."</seg>
<seg id="9">"her latest collaboration," A decent meal, "which will appear on Tuesday at Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="10">"they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a reporter in the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, snowy snack at the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate."</seg>
<seg id="12">"when the reporter had ordered minced meat, this was the pair for a discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich foods were very popular," "said Ziegelman."</seg>
<seg id="14">"there was peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread."</seg>
<seg id="15">"they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper, that the ingredient is stretched."</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine so many peanuts that they serve them as dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">CoE grins.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it has to be in the stomach like lead," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, an all-You-Can-Eat buffet."</seg>
<seg id="20">"men of women cooked for male rims and it was served freshly baked pate for breakfast, lunch and dinner."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the first World War." "a Square Meal" "honours the ways with which the country is surrounded by no longer the land of shame."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it was a time when food for Americans became a central, tense theme," "explained Coe, why he and his wife wanted to write about it."</seg>
<seg id="23">"the new budget was equally tense: mysterious meals, such as bread and casserole, became staple foods that recovered casserole as" wonderful species, leftover food leftovers, "found Ziegelman, as cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce."</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">"meat, which was the center of American cuisine for years, became a rare luxury."</seg>
<seg id="26">"peculiar mixes have been tried out, as a calorie-rich and nutritious satisfaction has precedence over taste or even healthy cuisine."</seg>
<seg id="27">"during her research for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from that era, baked onions with peanut butter."</seg>
<seg id="28">"it was no popular additive at lunchtime," says Coe. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"Ziegelman continues:" "it was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and baked onions do not match each other.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the home recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">"like never before or ever since, budget economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - were the country's eating habits."</seg>
<seg id="33">"by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become" "housekeepers" "and the challenge of converting Pampe as creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals."</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland shark: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland sharks usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research vessel Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Grönlandhaie only gets offspring with 150 years.</seg>
<seg id="7">"leisurely, the Greenland-shark floats along the North Atlantic coast, in an hour it reaches an average of just 1,220 meters."</seg>
<seg id="8">"only when it matters, the five meter long animal accelerates to a full 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed."</seg>
<seg id="9">"this lifestyle, coined by slowness, seems to be a prescription for a high age."</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" at least from a Greenland-shark who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"mad," said Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock this life-span, which means a world record for vertebrates. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"although the evolution biologist suspected long, that Greenland sharks are stone-old."</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland's sharks are difficult to observe, and finally they live mainly in the Ice Sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergen."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water temperatures of 6 degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in winter."</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland's sharks.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their slow-pentagine measure it when they withheld six animals in front of Svalbard with a transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear."</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly they hunt sleeping animals or patrol on the bottom of the iron and look for carcasses leading from higher water-layers down torches.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland-sharks which caught fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depths of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 cm long, while the largest 502 centimetre measured."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in order to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lenticular core of sharks with the carbon-14 method."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eye lens arises already before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained therein are no longer renewed."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had notably plenty of carbon-14 in the lens kernel.</seg>
<seg id="25">"its birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s, as a nuclear weapon attempt to alleviate large quantities of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"the lenticular nucleus, on the other hand, contained a small excess of carbon-14 out of the atomic weapons in the third-smallest animal with 220 centimeters. it was therefore likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">"on the other hand, all the larger Greenland sharks had normal carbon-14 quantities in their lenticular nucleus, resulting from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon-14 clock showed an age of 335 years for a 493 cm long Greenland shark, while the record shark with 502 centimeters was even 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that Greenland-shark-females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known."</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to classify the length of an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">"since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age with 156 years was determined, Greenland's sharks with the multiplication evidently permit at least one and a half centuries of time."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">The fact that such methane emes live above all in icy waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">"also the old record holder, a 211 years old Greenland-whale, in whose bacon at the neck stuck a 120 year old harpoon tip, was caught in front of Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there is often running on a flaming flame."</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are often very large."</seg>
<seg id="38">"the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses heat."</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with one gram Elefant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerously and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"on the other hand, a very large animal should invest his resources in a long life."</seg>

<seg id="7">"in a stark contrast, Donald Trump hides behind false statements and retracts regarding his previous promises to publish his tax declarations."</seg>

<seg id="10">"they are on the train," wrote Clinton's campaign assistant Ian Sams on Twitter, with regard to the publication of the Presidential candidate of the Democrats. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"on Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trumps Special Advisor, said to CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish something before tax inspections are not completed."</seg>
<seg id="12">"among other things, Trumps critics, including the Republican presidential candidate of 2012 Mitt Romney, have already announced that his refusal to raise questions regarding assets, donations for charitable organisations, his business and various other connections, particularly with Russia."</seg>

<seg id="5">"the perpetrators should have been between 1,60 and 1.70 meters tall, thus relatively small."</seg>
<seg id="6">The beverage market is directly accessible from the parking deck of the Rewe market and is badly visible.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the perpetrators have to be scanned in the direction of Gerberstraße, Friedrich Engelbert-Weg and fled from the gravel parking lot located opposite the park entrance with the silver-colored car, possibly in the direction of B 256 (Schladernring)."</seg>
<seg id="8">"those who made observations at the time of the Tatars (about 7.45 p.m.), which are related to the robbery attack, should urgently report to the police."</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministers from the pastoral unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way to Freiburg on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">"together, four stages were dealt with."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in order to bridge the time until the next Roman pilgrimage of all ministers in the last two years, the Pre-ministerial Round St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a long-day pilgrimage."</seg>
<seg id="5">"various pilgrimage destinations were examined and finally decided for the Episcopal city of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy with the opened gate of mercy on Freiburg Minster, a special pilgrimage destination was offered."</seg>
<seg id="6">"16 Minis from Bittelbronn, Gruol, and Haigerloch, and Heiligenzimmern, were on the way."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in the evening before, pastor Cancel sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed pilgrimages and shared pilgrimages."</seg>
<seg id="8">"from Horb we drove by train to the starting point Villingen, where also a Münster Unserer loved woman stood and so the pilgrimage took place from the Muenster."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening, each with a short impulse with different prayers, songs and texts."</seg>
<seg id="10">"but even on the way, the minis at field crossings, chapels or churches began to sing together again and again to sing a song from a specially produced pilgrim song booklet."</seg>
<seg id="11">Parishioners of the local parishes were available for overnight stays.</seg>
<seg id="12">"on the stoppers, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller ensured a tasty and strong dinner and breakfast."</seg>
<seg id="13">On the second day we went on Furtwangen to Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the day after that, one stepped on the stage to St. Peter, which was the most exhausting stretch of road, but at the pupil heat, at first some 500 metres of altitude had to be lowered and then reclaimed."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in the evening, the deserved reward was a common grilling on the pond."</seg>
<seg id="16">"after the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter, it went to Freiburg on the final stage."</seg>
<seg id="17">"visibly relieved and happy, the Minis arrived at the Freiburg Minster in the late afternoon and walked through the gates of mercy."</seg>
<seg id="18">With a small impulse God was given thanks.</seg>
<seg id="19">The minis of the operator Markus Obert were welcomed at the evening mass in Münster.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the divine service the pilgrims could visit the sacristy and the high altar.</seg>
<seg id="21">The next day was still time for the Breisgau metropolis.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the afternoon we went back to Horb by train.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner last night in the men's team sprint in the Velorom in Rio to fame when the British Team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the role that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made himself to Eigen. the yen made the legend proud when he stormed home to take home a victory from the favourites of New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">"four years ago, England claimed a shocking victory, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals."</seg>
<seg id="5">"they repeated the trick, after winning only a modest sixth place in March at the London World Championships in London, despite the back of Hoys."</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as executions.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man in which they stayed when they saw potential in the Scots that now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Hindes, Kenny - the four years ago with Hoy won the Olympic Champions in the qualification laps, but in the standard dogs the New Zealanders won the first round."</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the Duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">"after his lap, he was almost back, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it."</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a major part of the transformation in which Hindes went in a higher gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and above all Skinner to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Hoy looked at his position as a BBC expert and fell Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they got on the podium."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Glasgow's 23-year-old Skinner said," It's a flattering comparison. "</seg>
<seg id="16">I am only here to do my best and to make a name for myself.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in the final round, we set up an Olympic Record and the World Champion was defeated."</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just incredible.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph in 2012 on the Kennys and Hoys page he admitted that after a weak start he deliberately fell off the track.</seg>
<seg id="21">He returned this statement later and there was no objection to England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">"with such an outstanding victory, there was no such problem this time."</seg>
<seg id="23">"he said," "It feels like London on the tribune with all the UK flags."</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team over the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We did so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">"this is an event, a gold medal for the nation that has been won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London."</seg>
<seg id="27">"if this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect successful five days in the velodrome."</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form Kennys it is possible to repeat Hoys's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">"this would be for Kenny - exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a seemingly holy date for British sports; on the day also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal."</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same from Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Kenny is next to the Sprint, who starts today and will go for three days."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the 28-year-old from Bolton said," I just enjoy this for the moment. "</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"said Hindes:" "if he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight."</seg>
<seg id="37">"it was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometer race."</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived at the destination in 3: 51.942.</seg>
<seg id="40">"world record, which won gold in 2012 in London, was at 3: 51,659."</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition where Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">"yesterday, he had argued with officials before the qualification, when functionaries called him to measure his height."</seg>
<seg id="43">"Laura Trott, Joanna Rowel Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in World record time in 4: 13,260."</seg>
<seg id="44">The UK team relies on its strong train cycling team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and collect a number of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">"after a truly exceptional presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down."</seg>
<seg id="46">"in the background, the resignation of Shane Sutton's technical director Shane Sutton played in the middle of sexism and Mobbingvores, as well as retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton."</seg>
<seg id="47">"however, if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the velodrome, it looks quite like the legendary reputation of GBs, which at the perfect moment reached its climax, could be repeated again."</seg>

<seg id="1">Future of the melt production of Portland on account of the lifting of the energy yield</seg>
<seg id="2">"the future of the aluminium melts from Portland in Victoria, as well as hundreds of workstations of workers - are at stake, as the plant operator terminates the energy supply contract and thereby abolishes all supply contracts, such as the supplying energy company."</seg>
<seg id="3">"this was followed by the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies for the operation of the plant."</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy established for 20 years runs out in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the facility of Alcoa in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">No less than 2000 jobs -direct and indirect - could be at risk with closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in addition, it could come into domino effects, as the melt production consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity generation from Victorias."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in 2014, Alcoa completed the point Henry Schmelzerei, which led to a closing of the Anglesea power plant last year."</seg>
<seg id="9">The enamel of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">"this step follows years of speculation concerning the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently due to the electricity price for the plant."</seg>
<seg id="11">"AGL supplies the large aluminium melting plant with its Loy Yang A power station in Latrobe Valley, announces that three more owners will announce their contracts."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the facility is located in the majority ownership of a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, from which Chinese company CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller portions."</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity by melting," said the company. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"AGL continued to say that the contracts were so-called" "hedging stores", "which should have entered into force from November 2016."</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12-month notice period so that they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"for this reason, AGL expects that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to revenue," said the current supplier. "</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impacts on AGL revenues from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL announced that the value of the contracts had already been written down in its annual closing in the amount of $187 million in "expectation of a cancellation."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Alcoa said that the decision to apply the contracts, the" ability of Alcoas... to operate the enamel or to ensure the power supply to the melt "is not affected."</seg>
<seg id="20">"the US company said it had concluded a 20 year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which would have entered into force from November this year even if it is still a declaration of why it has resigned from the contract."</seg>
<seg id="21">"due to the bad economic conditions in the industry, analysts warn of the possible closure of Portland Schmelzerei in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in reference to the statements by the analysts at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland uses around 600 megawatts and tomago around 900 megawatts of electricity a year."</seg>
<seg id="23">"should both plants disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [electricity market]."</seg>
<seg id="24">"and for us as a generating set, that wouldn't be good," he said. "</seg>

<seg id="2">"Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian Jenner Clan Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of the US Vogue."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran to the fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover made me cry," Kendall wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="5">"the cover of the cover followed a bizarre (or simply keeping up with the Kardashians similar?), descriptive reality video showing the entire Kardashian Jenner family (except for the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn), as they forget the cover of their sister and ending with a classic twist: they all have a surprise party planned."</seg>
<seg id="6">"this represents the cliché action almost every birthday septic of a children's program (Seacons brought the sentence," You thought we had forgotten you? ", with the honesty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity."</seg>
<seg id="7">"with regard to the September issue of the Vogue, certainly a new era of the Kardashians started."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Kendalls's big sister Kim likes her, as regards the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were to be seen in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself."</seg>
<seg id="9">The September issue is for Vogue the most sold edition of the year.</seg>
<seg id="10">"with a circumference that is more similar to an illustrated book than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (According to the 832 pages of the tome 615 pages advertising)."</seg>
<seg id="11">The revelation of his cover-stars is so eagerly anticipated that in the last two years pictures of the magazine were still seeping before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">"women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in recent years there were clearly more" celebrities that mop "as" models, the celebrities are "on the cover."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga had the honour."</seg>
<seg id="15">"but even with the little chance that Mrs. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the" "breakthrough model" "of her generation - falls under the earlier category, it is in good company."</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or youths from today who know how to turn a good snapchat video (even if everything applies to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade."</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course Jenners don't like success to everybody.</seg>
<seg id="20">"with their reality TV history, Jenners's position in the fashion world has always been a bit tense."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in June, the former Victoria's Secret-model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized and called them the mistletins of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings came up again when the message came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue Cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But it seems to be at the point to walk around at the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.</seg>
<seg id="26">It runs for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">It makes advertising for your primer from Estee Lauder.</seg>
<seg id="28">She and all her sisters sell pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps.</seg>
<seg id="29">She is selling her own pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to the magazine LOVE.</seg>
<seg id="30">And in her free time she is seen in Reality TV. probably only to see her sister Kourtney and her children.</seg>

<seg id="2">Email and internet in slow motion: 20 years ago Nokia Communicator entered the market.</seg>
<seg id="3">The successors dominate the world today - his maker experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The device weighed nearly half kilograms and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was thicker and bigger, so it wasn't good at hand."</seg>
<seg id="6">"on the contrary, it was rather palpable."</seg>
<seg id="7">"initially, the built-in memory was eight megabytes, which would suffice today for about two selfies with high resolution."</seg>
<seg id="8">An iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 gigabytes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"the" Nokia 9000 Communicator "came to the stores exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, and it was the first smartphone."</seg>
<seg id="10">"for a few euros, fans can still buy the devices on the internet, but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet Age."</seg>
<seg id="11">"20 years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair" "Cebit in Hannover" "as an" "office in the western pocket format". ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"in fact, the new mobile phone could be sent and received for those standards: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even by fax, the communicator was to be reached."</seg>

<seg id="15">"a calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar."</seg>
<seg id="16">"there was a small antenna, and the mobile phone could be folded up like a laptop."</seg>
<seg id="17">Then there was a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the price was quite proud: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 Euro."</seg>
<seg id="19">The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in August 1996, no one could suspect that the communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era."</seg>
<seg id="21">"since then, everything has changed."</seg>
<seg id="22">"smart phones are a success story, although not for Nokia."</seg>
<seg id="23">"the Finns" cell phone line experienced an unprecedented disaster, eventually sold and handled to Microsoft. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"today, vendors are dominating the market, all of which came later as Nokia."</seg>

<seg id="2">Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London but throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="3">"for me, this was the biggest attraction of Heathrow, just like in 2012 in London when we took a big effort to make sure all our nations and regions benefited from the games."</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And we will achieve this again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">"for our local communities, we alone have already 10,000 new apprentices, creating 40,000 new jobs and putting an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment."</seg>
<seg id="7">"as they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of the extension of Heathrow is too great."</seg>
<seg id="8">I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be blaming at the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The two-fishers were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">"there are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question put to him."</seg>
<seg id="11">"like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project."</seg>
<seg id="12">"expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 bn in witty growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both to the airport and in the UK."</seg>
<seg id="13">"we have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from T5 - the five years in a row to the world's best airport terminal, up to the T2, which was built in the midst of the two most popular catwalks in the world."</seg>
<seg id="14">"now they are ready to deliver a third catwalk, which is supported by £16 billion on private investment."</seg>
<seg id="15">London's games of 2012 were a great success for UK and I am confident that Heathrow's expansion will also be one.</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably once habitable."</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms similar to those of climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could once have revealed similar conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">"but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and still revolved slowly."</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the planet probably showed more dry areas than Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to accommodate life and protected from rapid evaporation."</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow revolution of Venus exposed its day-side of the sun for almost two months," explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"this warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from most of the sun's heat."</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">"the model brought forth a history of Venus, similar to evolution that had previously been suspected by planetary researchers."</seg>
<seg id="14">"although it was believed to be habitable, Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light over the course of several billion years."</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burnt away by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">"as their hydrogen, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus, which we know today."</seg>

<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail users currently use targeted companies - and they are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">"according to a recent survey of malware defense specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of surveyed companies in the past twelve months were at least once, partly multiple victims of an attack with blackmail software."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ransomware-blackmail."</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransom paid by the perpetrators to reuse the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">"according to the observations of Malwarebytes, the perpetrators speculate on attacks in company networks."</seg>
<seg id="7">"if they are successful there, the potential for redeeming ransom is significantly higher than with private users."</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a terrifying rapid evolution of the malware," explains Malwarebytes chief Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world." "</seg>
<seg id="9">"in 2008, most of the malware programs were designed to send advertisements."</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">"first of all, private users were the target, but the change to company attacks occurred quickly over the past few months."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once on the computer of an victim, it searches for recently modified files such as Word-, Excel or Database files as well as archives of pictures and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypts the ransomware and deletes the originals permanently.</seg>
<seg id="14">"subsequently, the software presents the demands of the blackmail."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in order to get the final key code to the files, the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of Cryptocurrencies Bitcoin."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but where private users use the personal photo database on the game, companies are concerned about sensitive customer data or project databases without which production stops."</seg>
<seg id="17">"accordingly, the damage occurs when a ransomware performs."</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 percent of the affected German companies reported loss of revenue due to Ransomware, 13 percent even had to break their business completely, in one case people were in danger of life."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be acute by the loss of patient records."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we always tell the victims: it doesn't pay, it only promotes the problem," explains Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay will get their data again.</seg>
<seg id="22">"for managers, it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators in view of still stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="23">"the hackers, in turn, know that and try to build a good reputation."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in a recent study, the safety researchers of F-Secure have examined the user interface and contact with the blackmail and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they tell their victims per chat how they can pay per Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites or decrypt sample files for free."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and if private individuals are redeemed after payments of a few hundred Euro, companies must partly negotiate hard and pay five-figure sums to get their data unencrypted."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in view of the potentially high and relatively low-risk gains from the ransomware blackmail, the hackers are becoming more professional and share their work, said security expert Chester Wisniewski from the anti-virus provider SOPHOS:" a single person can write a ransomware about within a week. "</seg>

<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software modular system to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">"malware kits have been created by buying malware, consulting and additional tools for a one-time, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the scope of delivery includes a adjustment tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," Wisniewski says. "</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmail customers are then looking for more hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">"so one logs in one of the forums on the ground, buys the set of one criminals and instructs another to install the software on as many PCs as possible."</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made on a registered calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually the criminals then commission spammers with the spread," "Wisniewski explains."</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known by many companies that better protect their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of the companies IT leaders in the Malwarebytes survey confide to repel Ransomware by means of file back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">"accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies."</seg>
<seg id="40">"when data encryption is no longer a sufficient threat to successful recovery, the perpetrators are threatening to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes chief Marcin Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="41">"thus, the potential for damage, depending on the type of data, is much higher than before."</seg>
<seg id="42">"in the future, the perpetrators could also entirely focus on new targets on the internet of things."</seg>
<seg id="43">"at the Hackerkonferenz, Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how to control a thermostat that was connected to the Internet under their control."</seg>
<seg id="44">"in the middle of the winter, the activation of such a blockaded heating could well be worth a ransom."</seg>
<seg id="45">"if the perpetrators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0."</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing night: tips for sleeping disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">"in the evening, one walks around eternally, at night, one is awake for hours, in the morning it is no longer possible to think of sleep in the morning."</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after all, one is with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about one quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or durably than not restorative."</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disorders manifest?</seg>
<seg id="6">"there are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many causes behind them, says Hans-Günter Weeß, Member of the Executive Board of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine."</seg>
<seg id="7">"but the insomnia, therefore, is a single and dormant disorder."</seg>
<seg id="8">"just sleep many people feel unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board of the German Medical Association with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel."</seg>
<seg id="9">What's behind sleep problems?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">"there can be organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also medicines."</seg>
<seg id="12">Sleep disturbance is often an expression of another disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early awakening is especially common in a depression," "says Weeß."</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors require each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">"for example, who has a herniated disc, can lie poorly, wakes up every two to three hours and possibly starts to ponder on everyday problems and worries, there is one example."</seg>
<seg id="16">"this leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible."</seg>
<seg id="17">When should you become a doctor with sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week should go to the doctor advised.</seg>
<seg id="19">"impairment can be quite different: one is beaten, tired, sleepy, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical discomfort such as stomach or headaches."</seg>
<seg id="20">"to alleviate the sleep problem, it is important to find out their causes."</seg>
<seg id="21">"treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, or medication - classical stroke tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - ineligible."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in Germany, low medical doctors hardly exist, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep-medical centre of the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin."</seg>
<seg id="23">"therefore, when sleeping problems, one should contact the primary doctor first."</seg>
<seg id="24">It can investigate whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">"who should go to sleep, and what happens?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"for example, in the case of snoring with breathing cutters, for example in sleeping bags or if you don't find the cause of a sleeping disorder, Fietze explains."</seg>
<seg id="27">It is not necessary to prepare for the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only please do not make a nap," says Fietze. "</seg>
<seg id="30">"after the sticking, one goes to bed at its normal time."</seg>
<seg id="31">"besides the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose-glasses, a chest strap and a sensor on the finger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"in addition, a camera draws on the sleeping end at the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="33">How can affected parties get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of adjusting screws on which you can set for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">"it counts on: regular sleeping and recording times, not too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, do not watch TV for falling asleep, stop drinking alcohol and don't look at the clock at night - then one starts to reckon immediately, and that is not conducive."</seg>

<seg id="1">"the Riga road in Berlin-Friedrichshain doesn't look like that, but the police is one of the" dangerous places "of the city."</seg>
<seg id="2">"when one goes along the road from east to west, one passes to playgrounds, a newly painted kindergarten and a bio-shop."</seg>
<seg id="3">"on the facade of a gray house, someone has sprayed" ugly!. ""</seg>
<seg id="4">"compared to a Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, it is already being built: until 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new flats is to be built here."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in recent weeks, however, articles about this" trendy district, "as the responsible housing estate company Friedrichshain, are preferred by burning cars."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have rental contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events."</seg>
<seg id="7">"since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin interior senator Henkel had spoken several times for a hard action by the police against the project, the area referred to as" no-go-zone "for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous force."</seg>
<seg id="8">"on June 22nd, the police evacuated the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers, patrolled off official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three team-cars on site, locked off parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94."</seg>
<seg id="9">"meanwhile, construction workers commissioned the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners."</seg>
<seg id="10">"on 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that clearing was illegal, and a day later police and construction workers removed from sympathizers and residents."</seg>
<seg id="11">"on this summer afternoon, the street looks peaceful: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk about late late."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the immediate vicinity of the house projects, there is a primary school and kindergartens."</seg>
<seg id="13">"left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in the Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who carries out three children here, are mainly irritated by the police presence."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with the inhabitants of the house projects, they share the concern for increasing ramifications and gentrification."</seg>
<seg id="15">"it does not sound like a Kiez, who wished for majority police protection against vandaliating leftists."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the trench, which the Berlin interior senator and the police opened between house occupants and their neighbors, apparently does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Friedrichshain in East Berlin was actually a traditional working-class district, which also today compared to the rest of the city has a low average income and a high risk of poverty."</seg>
<seg id="18">"house occupations and the resulting residential projects have long been part of the neighbourhood: in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer Strasse very close to the Rīga."</seg>
<seg id="19">"while the Mainzer had been evacuated under large police orders in a regular street battle, many of the projects in the Rīga were legalized and some of them were still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, the district has become a magnet for tourists and constituents from all over the world over the past few years."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is also reflected in the rents, which have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009."</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rīga are attacked as symbols for this development: they can be seen on inserted discs or freshly painted facades that have been thrown off with bags of paint.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road was mentioned this year as often together with the words "left-handed power."</seg>
<seg id="24">"one reason that not all neighbours look at this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as bodily injury, according to statistics, are almost exclusively directed against policemen."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most of the crimes are causing property damage, which tend to meet newbuilds and newly renovated houses."</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a rented house beside the controversial 94 for 17 years, there can be no talk of uncertainty."</seg>
<seg id="27">"as far as violence is concerned, it is important: people in the 94 are their neighbors, they were not destined to be."</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars are no longer available at the Riga Rīga anymore.</seg>
<seg id="29">"for the architect, her street is not a criminal focus, on the contrary:" here one helps one another, lives together on the street and gets more from one another, than elsewhere. ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer has deliberately moved into the Rīga Street - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">"for this reason it was also so important that the residents got their way back: from the police, politics and the media, who suddenly claimed the interpretation sovereignty over the district in July."</seg>
<seg id="32">"but in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the street will continue to be taken away from them: through faceless new buildings in former buildings, which displace the old inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="33">"in the end, these are freehold flats which are not interesting for many - here people prefer people who are not so well stocked," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "violence and destruction I can absolutely not approve."</seg>
<seg id="35">But what can you do if someone never listens to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">"there is frustration on all sides, including the police and the inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="37">"for those who stumble over colour bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the house projects and the left scene belong to the Kiez."</seg>

<seg id="6">"it sees itself as a contact for all actors: refugees, workers for refugees, administration, authorities and anyone else involved."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Regine customer of the working group indicates that the honorary official are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the freezing wooldsau, which has above all a problem."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in this way, some - less spotting than the multitude of task areas - meant to be targeted - meant when the administration wanted to leave the place."</seg>
<seg id="9">"looking for an administrative force with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, a self-reliant wooldsau."</seg>
<seg id="10">"but administrative work is not their central area, meaning Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="11">"above all, it is about organization, work with local people and behind the scenes as well as networking activities."</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50-percent position on three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine customer, that Annika Deuschle supports honest and full-time actors. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"there are big and small problems, organisational, human and communication problems."</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers stand in the street</seg>
<seg id="17">"for some time, a serious problem has been to find apartments for connecting flights that have been recognized."</seg>
<seg id="18">Local authorities are responsible for the connection provision.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented dormitories.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the cost of building, rent or renovation of these accommodations must be borne by municipalities themselves."</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the stewards to the municipality and Jobcenters.</seg>
<seg id="22">"problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment."</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">"de facto, the administration does not find private apartments."</seg>
<seg id="25">"so far, it didn't work so far, you depend on private apartments, according to Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, common apartments must be intimidated as it is so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will be erected in the washing line.</seg>
<seg id="28">But it is not done with apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">"perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in addition to a fixed place, there are internships, training places, school grounds, one-euro jobs and employment activities for refugees and migrants who need to be tiled or set up."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine customer. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the building yard or help house masters, do charitable work - and that motivates and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reports."</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes the work for the community leads to a positive external action.</seg>
<seg id="34">That is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day needs a firm structure, say Deuschle and customer."</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so I need offers like sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">"thus, administration and honorary official also jump here."</seg>
<seg id="41">It is important that the refugees have the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"they have to explain the refugees that it takes time and they can bridge the time wisely, for example with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"those who eventually develop the feeling that he couldn't help anyone in Urbach could not work and be useless, he will never integrate."</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"but there are problems, says customer honestly," people with whom nothing goes. "the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others."</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: do the two have fear of radicalisation after the recent incidents, even in a small community like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," Regine customer says quite clearly, "what some may call naïve." a residual risk could and may not exclude them. "</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the assassins put them completely in demand.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "says Regine customer."</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">"so, main and honorary officials have to look out for activities in the region and in the region."</seg>
<seg id="56">They have always in the background that soon a new push to refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a ceiling?</seg>
<seg id="58">The question clearly to answer is the policy.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to put them helpers on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we haven't reached where we want to go," "says Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="61">"no new refugees, that would be able to relax."</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbach are already busy integrating the previous people sensibly.</seg>
<seg id="63">"these are currently around 100 people, mainly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree."</seg>
<seg id="65">"the political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers."</seg>
