Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu isn &apos;t just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
but the meeting should also deal with the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement construction and th@@ rows Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
&quot; through the deal promoted by Obama on Iran &apos;s nuclear programme , the relationship between the two has deterior@@ ated further . &quot;
&quot; in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu has held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Republi@@ can Congress , which has partly been considered an aff@@ ront against Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting rejected this agreement with reference to the election in Israel that was im@@ minent . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor promised to have shot his girlfriend &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; Lamb was important to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; within the house the officials found the corp@@ se of A@@ my Pr@@ att@@ ss and a hand@@ written note , which was cut down on a white block : &quot; I am so sorry , I wanted to reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb . &quot;
&quot; there was no clu@@ e that Lamb , who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds , where according to the police , he shot and killed a popular professor of history , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office . &quot;
Delta State University Poli@@ ph@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb had made the fatal emergency call at some point later .
&quot; until the end of the day , there was another death : Lamb took the life when the police ra@@ ced him . &quot;
&quot; one day after the shooting in the university , which forced students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb is motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped draw a picture of a talented , but potentially difficult teacher . &quot;
students said they were looking forward to their lessons .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ att@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or a criminal pre@@ history . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students attended courses from both . &quot;
at the same time there were some tendencies towards problematic behavi@@ ors .
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that Lamb told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University to have an absence of absence due to health reasons and said he had any health problem .
this year he only taught two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion for which Lamb had worked so hard for him would be no guarantee for an automatic road to employment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
&quot; after the escape from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs trail when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as . &quot;
&quot; before being arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said that she knew that he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
Lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; Lamb opened his work at the University in 2009 , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y . &quot;
he did his doctorate in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y .
&quot; one of Lam@@ bs &apos;s long @-@ standing friends described him as intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ la H@@ air@@ tone said she was 15 and lamb was 20 , when they met by common friends . &quot;
&quot; she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar . &quot;
he was the women &apos;s flock at that time .
&quot; all the girls were melting away when he was there , &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ tone , now 40 and in Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ att@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; in the emergency call , Lamb &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no document of a marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ att@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they had been divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends left and had a daughter who was 19 years old now . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
Lamb met Pr@@ att@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail met both in a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together one or another gig .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , his daughter writes and sings her own music . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ tender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a dim@@ ly lit bar close to Gau@@ tier , said he saw Lamb and Pr@@ att@@ ss Night last night after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica play before a spar@@ se audience . &quot;
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were in the clearing and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
&quot; Schmidt , the dead Professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American natives and colonial history , said Don Allen Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school . &quot;
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his br@@ otherhood and of the student committee .
&quot; on Tuesday evening around 900 people , including lec@@ turers , staff , students and members of the community participated in a candle light memorial service at the Cle@@ vel@@ and Delta State campus . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the vi@@ gil , while the Univers@@ itä@@ tsch@@ or &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang . &quot;
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
&quot; A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; Associ@@ ated Press authors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebe@@ cca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans have contributed to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story has been corrected to reflect that Lamb made the emergency , after he had shot SCH@@ MID@@ T , and that Lamb in his distress call Pr@@ att@@ ss called his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married . &quot;
To@@ ys R Us plans to employ fewer workers for Christmas time
To@@ ys R Us says that it will not be so many Christmas season employees as last year but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the current staff and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
&quot; the company said that it plans to employ 40,000 people in shops and distribution centers throughout the country . in the Christmas season 2014 , 45@@ ,000 workers were hired . &quot;
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said it will start with application interviews this month and the number of employees from October to December is increasing .
&quot; while the holidays are still months away , Christmas business is approaching , and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equip shops with employees who sell , ship and deliver products . &quot;
Michael J. Fox j@@ okes about his &quot; date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the Roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and I realize that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the film begins , and it comes to my mind that I am a simulated y@@ aw@@ ning and a leg length away from being with the princess of Wales on a date . &quot;
&quot; back in Time , a documentary about Back to the Future , presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; back for the Future &quot; was premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; Spiel@@ berg said , &quot; &quot; un@@ str@@ it@@ ably the biggest journey film ever made . &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October . &quot;
UN chief states there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; UN Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon states that Russia &apos;s military support for Syria is reinforced by Russia : &quot; &quot; there is no military solution &quot; &quot; of the almost five @-@ year @-@ long conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN boss again calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution . &quot;
&quot; ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the ver@@ ge of meeting the General Assembly meeting this month to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
he lam@@ ented that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot;
&quot; Ban also called on five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in tac@@ kling the crisis in Syria , which they demonstrated in the at@@ tainment of a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot;
8 survey values that show Donald Tru@@ mp is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have taken him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tru@@ mp from top ranks in surveys , it hasn &apos;t worked . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys have shown Donald Tru@@ mp in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to ask seriously what it means for the chances of nomin@@ ating the real estate . &quot;
of course it is still too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tru@@ mp will probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts emphasize that at this time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys leadership was handed over to the rising Her@@ man Cain , of which no one also won a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb Bush &apos;s Super PA@@ C and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognize Tru@@ mp@@ s staying power and start letting their dollars flow in order to overthrow him .
here are some current survey values suggest@@ ing that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
Tru@@ mp@@ s Pop@@ ular values have turned 180 degrees .
&quot; just before Donald Tru@@ mp announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey by Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l positive . &quot;
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
&quot; now , six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tru@@ mp . &quot;
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in the early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa last week stated that 60 percent of the re@@ public@@ ans have a good opinion of Tru@@ mp .
two @-@ thirds of the GO@@ P voters Go@@ P would be happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
&quot; in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week , 67 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans said they were either &quot; excited &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tru@@ mp was nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two of 10 say they would be &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; if he was the candidate . &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates approximately the same enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; thrilled &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about Tru@@ mp ) .
the next one in excitement ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of the Republi@@ can voters say that they were &quot; uns@@ atis@@ fied &quot; or &quot; angry &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate . &quot;
a majority of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans do not see Tru@@ mp@@ s Temper@@ ament as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive remarks , 52 percent of the Irish voters in favour of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans believe that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is considered in the first electoral state of the nation , State of I@@ owa , where the same 52 per cent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively carry out his office , and almost six of 10 independent people say that his temper@@ ament does not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post . &quot;
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
&quot; if they expose their hon@@ orable hats , Republi@@ can voters are holding Tru@@ mp for real . &quot;
&quot; when asked who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , after a pol@@ l of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , four out of ten say that Tru@@ mp is the best bet . &quot;
&quot; this is a change since the moment , when four of ten at the end of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush . &quot;
complete disclosure : in the past GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
&quot; at that time in the last cycle , four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination against only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; however , it is evident that a large number of GO@@ P voters view Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s campaign as plau@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; even if the re@@ public@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tru@@ mp is still beating almost everyone . &quot;
&quot; some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to tru@@ mp leadership , while the anti @-@ Tru@@ mp support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates . &quot;
&quot; but a survey by Mon@@ mouth University at the beginning of September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tru@@ mp and most other republi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp has harvested the majority of support . &quot;
&quot; he has 13 points ahead of Charlie Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points ahead , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , ahead of Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally to Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tru@@ mp fans say they have formed their minds .
&quot; a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters who support Tru@@ mp , say they have forgiven their votes . &quot;
&quot; of course , a lot can happen to change that and no one can really say never change the opinion . &quot;
46 percent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
&quot; nonetheless , Tru@@ mp@@ s is the strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as common for Tru@@ mp . &quot;
six out of ten re@@ public@@ ans say they agree with Tru@@ mp on immigration .
&quot; since Donald Tru@@ mp in his election campaign before two months ago immigrants from Mexico called &quot; &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; , &quot; the immigration and fishing point was in public discourse in 2016 . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tru@@ mp will remove crucial His@@ panic Americans from the Republi@@ can Party and damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
&quot; but according to the new ABC / Post survey on Monday , six out of ten re@@ public@@ ans say they agree with Tru@@ mp on immigration issues . &quot;
&quot; so long as the immigration in the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght remains , Donald Tru@@ mp apparently will do . &quot;
the fru@@ stration of the government climbs to new high@@ s .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son have now accounted for about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , especially by their out@@ si@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; six out of ten re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days @-@ Survey of ABC / Post , they rather want a political out@@ sider as someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are also angry at Washington .
&quot; a survey by D@@ es Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans at the congress , with 54 per cent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent angry . &quot;
&quot; Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential districts in Germany &quot;
here in the Hob@@ ook@@ en@@ weg is the most expensive residential community - with a view over the North Sea .
&quot; in the street , one square meter of a can@@ opy house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros . &quot;
&quot; on Sy@@ lt , the supply of objects is naturally limited , &quot; says the study - therefore the high price . &quot;
a new study shows in which particular locations a square metre is the most cost .
&quot; of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really a little . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residential areas , however , one of the price is like Pe@@ an@@ uts . &quot;
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völk@@ ers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square footage in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
&quot; there are several tens of thousands of Euro ni@@ x - per square meter , well @-@ noticed . &quot;
but good who can afford it ...
&quot; by the way : Munich is , as an exception , not at the top . &quot;
champi@@ ons League : Bavaria &apos;s dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
tw@@ o@@ fold scor@@ er in Pi@@ re@@ aus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller paved the way for the FC Bayern the way to a deserved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ raeus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ elu@@ de to the Champions League season .
&quot; world champi@@ ons Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze have embark@@ ed on a dream start into the &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; of the FC Bayern in the witch @-@ pot of Pi@@ raeus . &quot;
the team of coaches P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won her top game in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Götz@@ fri@@ es ( 8@@ 9th ) deserves at 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ fth race success in series will be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to bring the H@@ enk@@ el@@ ote to Munich in the third attempt . &quot;
&quot; at his 28th hit in the Champions League , Müller received a boun@@ tiful help from Olympi@@ ac@@ os go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto , who suffered a shot of the world champion as a f@@ lange . &quot;
&quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; Bayern @-@ captain Philipp L@@ ahm had promised hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 - and the Munich @-@ based words . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and committed performance without shining .
&quot; Pi@@ raeus had won his youngest six home games in the kingdom class , among them against well @-@ known clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund was proud ( 1 : 3 ) .
&quot; but the Bavaria , defeated in seven European ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they went cour@@ age@@ ously , but in their offensive efforts they were often too resour@@ ceful . &quot;
&quot; the attacks were often introduced by game reloc@@ ation to the left @-@ hand side of Douglas Costa , which rarely came through against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i . &quot;
Müller had more luck from the right when his flan@@ k struck from the right half @-@ field in the left upper Tor@@ que .
&quot; in the 6@@ 7th minute , the World Champion promised the possible 2 : 0 . &quot;
the best occasions in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
&quot; first of all , when Olympi@@ ac@@ os stri@@ ker Ideal Brown proposed the poles of the Pole from the line ( 26 . ) . &quot;
then by direct appointment that par@@ ted go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto with his knee ( 35 . ) .
&quot; although the Bav@@ arians reg@@ ained their usual dominant game , Pi@@ raeus was able to set needle pun@@ ches . &quot;
but he was reli@@ eved of Manuel Neu@@ er .
&quot; for example , when he directed a shot of Ide@@ a on the latte ( 5@@ 6th ) . &quot;
before New he left Guardi@@ ola to defend a four @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who did it well .
&quot; Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the cad@@ re , was sitting outside . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup Her@@ o has given the green light only after the final workout , &quot; commented Director Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; who wants to make something different from it , this is already malign@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; at the first time , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) . &quot;
&quot; Got@@ ze arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it all clear 13 minutes later , mil@@ ing mil@@ ler on it . &quot;
before the game it had come to Kra@@ v@@ allen in the stadium .
&quot; after a smaller group of partly war@@ med Bavaria fans in their audience block apparently provoked the followers of the host Pir@@ äus with words and gestures , the security forces interven@@ ed and went with bat@@ ches against the Munich fans . &quot;
at least one Bayern fan was injured from the stadium .
&quot; who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth &quot;
&quot; if you smoke , do not harm only the lungs but also your teeth - this suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study . &quot;
good news : when ren@@ unciation reduces the risk quickly .
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
&quot; this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; compared to non @-@ smo@@ kers , smo@@ kers found the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely , increasing the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 times . &quot;
&quot; the scientists observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants . &quot;
&quot; root causes for tooth decay are tooth decay and inflammation of the gin@@ gi@@ val , stresses the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
&quot; for this perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors . &quot;
the relationship between smoking and loss of teeth therefore result in more frequent gin@@ gi@@ val inflamm@@ ations in smo@@ kers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of c@@ aries .
&quot; however , people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk within a short period of time , the researchers write in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , it could take more than ten years until the danger again sin@@ ks to the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers , &quot; &quot; said Thomas Dietrich of Birmingham , England . &quot;
&quot; people should persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smo@@ kers , said Student H@@ a Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking shor@@ tens life time . &quot;
smoking is good for lungs and containers and leads to good dental health even up to high age .
&quot; in Germany , over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 was affected by loss of tooth@@ lessness , divided the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
earlier studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ pin the findings .
archae@@ ologists find rem@@ nants of the late Anti@@ quity in Cologne &apos;s Rhine @-@ bank
&quot; for the repeated time , archaeological finds have been made at the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne . &quot;
&quot; near the construction site for the new Rhine Boulevard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic Museum have dug skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of construction work on the Rhine , historians have been searching for so @-@ called soil monuments . &quot;
&quot; for all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always considered as a department of archaeological soil preservation . &quot;
archae@@ ologists now found the third part of the Rhine Boulevard .
&quot; from text documents it has already been known that at the place in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century stood a church , Trier has explained . &quot;
&quot; in addition to rem@@ nants of the fortress and the church tower , a cemetery with around 350 tom@@ bs was discovered , which probably belonged to the church . &quot;
young woman captured by freight
&quot; after a young woman died at the station in the &quot; &quot; Gei@@ lenk@@ ir@@ chen &quot; &quot; l@@ enti@@ ls , the Federal Police asked the people for help . &quot;
&quot; on the early Wednesday morning at about 1.@@ 40 pm , the woman arrived from the station building , arriving at the end of the platform , and was captured by a freight train coming from the direction of Mön@@ chen@@ glad@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; due to the acquisition of the train , it has carried serious injuries to the federal police . &quot;
she was treated with emergency medical care and was brought to a hospital by rescue personnel .
&quot; on the grounds of the ni@@ gh@@ tly crossing of the young woman , there are no knowledge to the cler@@ ical officials . &quot;
the incident was perhaps observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic percep@@ tions .
&quot; there are local residents or pass@@ ers @-@ by by Lin@@ der@@ ner Train , Ziegel@@ ü@@ cker@@ weg , Thom@@ as@@ hof@@ strasse and Lei@@ ff@@ ar@@ ther Straße ( L@@ 3@@ 64 ) . &quot;
&quot; information about the cause of the accident , can be given under 24 / 800 / 6@@ 88@@ 8000 and any other police station under phone 0@@ 800 / 6@@ 88@@ 8000 or any other police station . &quot;
European Commission propos@@ ing new court in dispute over TTIP
&quot; in order to intensi@@ fy the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot;
&quot; the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between companies and states should therefore be replaced with a more transparent system , which in its functioning meets much more traditional dishes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; said Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström in the performance . &quot;
the Swe@@ de proposes to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
&quot; through TTIP , the largest free trade area in the world is to develop with 800 million people . &quot;
&quot; the plans for reform of the current arbit@@ ration process specifically envis@@ age that the EU states , and the US , jointly select independent judges for a new investment court . &quot;
&quot; they should come to equal parts from the EU , the US and third countries . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , a second instance is scheduled for the first time . &quot;
it would allow it to obj@@ ected obj@@ ections to jud@@ gements .
&quot; so far , the parties agreed with each other on refer@@ ees , there was no obj@@ ections to their jud@@ gements . &quot;
&quot; in the discussion of recent months , it became clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , Malm@@ ström . &quot;
&quot; in the long term , it intends to work towards an international investment court based on its own data . &quot;
&quot; there could , for example , resolve disputes between Chinese companies and EU states . &quot;
the investor state arbit@@ ration ( IS@@ DS ) demanded especially by large corporations is one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP .
&quot; traditional Ar@@ bit@@ ration Cour@@ ts are critic@@ ised by opponents as a kind of parallel justice , who tax the tax@@ pa@@ yers to negotiate national laws , or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organizations such as Camp@@ act rejected the proposals made by the European Commission as inadequate . &quot;
&quot; it has been critic@@ ised , above all , that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) . &quot;
&quot; the German state secretary , Matthias Sei@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a great advance . &quot;
the Commission considered essential points in the reform that the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sig@@ mar Gabriel worked with other EU trade ministers in the spring .
the old system of private arbit@@ ration courts is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European business association Business@@ Europe warned against restric@@ ting the mour@@ ning possibilities of the economy by too many new rules .
especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged thereby .
&quot; when the talks on the TTIP free trade agreement ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , it remains unclear on Wednesday . &quot;
the negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
&quot; however , the subject of investor protection has not been discussed with the United States . &quot;
&quot; originally , a framework for the agreement was supposed to be at the end of this year . &quot;
this date is no longer valid .
delicate folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
&quot; eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sat on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) . &quot;
&quot; next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the timi@@ dly acting folk singer has filmed the picturesque US state Mich@@ igan with felt pen . &quot;
&quot; the entire audience , about 40 persons , is almost seized by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture . &quot;
&quot; he talks about different places , which he always records on the map , about his meti@@ culously arranged songs . &quot;
&quot; where they arose and how it looks , in his homeland . &quot;
&quot; since then , St@@ ev@@ ens has been a wonderfully creative Ir@@ rer . &quot;
&quot; released in 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan : the Great Lake State , &quot; clever@@ ly composed songs that blend harmon@@ i@@ ously close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can drift into great opul@@ ent anytime . &quot;
&quot; the rum@@ or arises , &quot; Mich@@ igan &quot; would be the first part of a dar@@ ing series : each of the 50 states should be sung in a row . &quot;
&quot; but already in 2004 and in the Rhine @-@ proximity , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; has already appeared and breaks out positively certain expectations . &quot;
reducing St@@ ev@@ ens appears here .
live with him are guitar and ban@@ jo .
&quot; one year later , the musician living in New York returns to the series . &quot;
&quot; with &quot; Il@@ lin@@ ois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ ois &quot; ) , a truly celebrated masterpiece will be published in 2005 . &quot;
sur@@ rendering of ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is missing in no annual list of influential music media .
&quot; following very productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensively electronic pieces . &quot;
&quot; this sixth ord@@ inal studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but performed by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effects and rever@@ ber@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; since the smaller clubs got off , the stage shows become a colorful spectacle of ne@@ on head@@ bands and big fluorescent stage de@@ co . &quot;
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is part of a five member band through Germany .
in the dark@@ ened ham@@ burger More !
&quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot;
&quot; although almost 2000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the far ri@@ cher St@@ ev@@ ens returns to in@@ timacy and to folk . &quot;
&quot; without a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians is playing through the broad @-@ enriched album . &quot;
&quot; you hear from the audience : the lecture is &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; and you can basically throw away the &quot; &quot; record &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; only at an en@@ core , St@@ ev@@ ens notices modest , plays acousti@@ cally few older songs and finally bows down under thunder@@ ous applause . &quot;
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s questions
&quot; since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s survey will be eag@@ erly awaited . &quot;
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is supposed to make his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s questions and for the first time making himself with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to ask for the first of his six questions shortly after lunch whereby his performance is likely to be tested by the media and the Labour MPs out of the neighbourhood .
he called for &quot; fewer theatres and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave her colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , because after his appointment she will be a member of the Shadow Cab@@ inet and after his speech at the Annual General Meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the Labour leader &apos;s decision on Tuesday during the singing of the national an@@ them during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence has provoked a cri@@ tique of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and is at the heart of several news stories in the newspapers . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
a spokes@@ man of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had been &quot; respect@@ ful of silence &quot; and recognised the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s Schatten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve at Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they refer to differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as a leader . &quot;
&quot; the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC , Robin Bran@@ t , says that political differences are also stack@@ ed within Labour &quot; while Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s comments on the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour amendments lay out to remove all the idea of a constra@@ int altogether .
&quot; hours later Mr Smith , the Shadow Employment and R@@ ents Minister said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against government plans to reduce the amount of £ 26@@ ,000 to £ 23@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader , headed by David Cameron ever since he has been head of the T@@ ory , over the Dis@@ patch box in parliament last decade . &quot;
&quot; the Labour leader , who has promised another politi@@ cian , says he has &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; the Is@@ ling@@ ton North MP has said that the prime minister &apos;s questions are too confron@@ t@@ ative , and that he has both &quot; &quot; pun@@ ctu@@ ality &quot; &quot; and tac@@ kling the dispute and has instead focused on concentrating on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle - the Shadow of Economic Council will represent him if he does not participate - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
&quot; he also initiated the idea that other colleagues may occasionally take the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the lower house , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he became a leader in 2005 Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; &quot; Ju@@ dy &amp; Ju@@ dy show &quot; , &quot; which is often linked to the Prime Minister &apos;s question . but a few years later he admitted that he failed in it . &quot;
&quot; when it was first sent to television in 1990 , the question was viewed with the Prime Minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of the ruling part of a leader and his leadership in the House of Represent@@ atives and his position among his colleagues , although critics have argued that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require far @-@ reaching reforms . &quot;

convert pounds thanks to accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
&quot; the pound rose by le@@ aps of data indicating an increase in the United Kingdom &apos;s wage growth . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by SA@@ B@@ Miller &apos;s bid . &quot;
&quot; between May and July , the result without Bon@@ uses in the UK grew by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the previous year . &quot;
&quot; this percentage has been the quick@@ est rate since 2009 , and estimates the timing of an increase in interest rates . &quot;
&quot; the pound rose by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 . &quot;
the FT@@ SE 100 Index closed by 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29.@@ 21 .
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after the takeover offer of the Ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v was entered .
&quot; one transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot;
Bur@@ berry shares were Rich@@ em@@ ont 0.@@ 9 % higher after encouraging news from the rival Group for luxury goods .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures beat all expectations and showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
Gl@@ en@@ core shares rose by 5 % after the mining giant said that it took 2.5 billion $ by a stock sale as part of its debt reduction strategy .
&quot; the shares of the packaging and paper company Mon@@ di were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a decrease of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his appreciation for the company rating on &quot; sell . &quot; &quot;
&quot; J@@ D Sports increased by 3.1 % , after the sports management company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the half year . &quot;
the head of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages thre@@ aten expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
&quot; but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs at his company , he says . &quot;
&quot; the costs could hit the expan@@ sion@@ plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs . &quot;
J@@ ustin Bie@@ ber in Capital : on Bie@@ ber expedition in Berlin
&quot; J@@ ustin Bie@@ ber , Meg@@ ast@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; 21 years young , a hand@@ ing with over@@ hanging fr@@ ise . &quot;
the type with plat@@ inum @-@ blonde hair is 100 million euros heavy .
more likely more .
&quot; currently , Mon@@ si@@ eur Bie@@ ber is in Berlin . &quot;
and the generation of U@@ 17 is spinning .
similar to Wi@@ k@@ tori@@ a Ru@@ d@@ zin@@ ska .
&quot; the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name &quot; &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton &quot; . &quot; &quot;
not bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied J@@ ustin yesterday .
among them E@@ wa and Vik@@ tori@@ a from Poland .
&quot; but since 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , the Pol@@ in sits on the cold stone plates in front of Berlin &apos;s luxury hotel on Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz . &quot;
&quot; the construction of the Bie@@ ber : here , her i@@ dol , whose poster hangs in Sz@@ cz@@ ec@@ tin , lives here since Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; the suite in which the Canadian singer lives , costs just as much on the day as her mom@@ my E@@ wa deserves in half a year . &quot;
if at all .
&quot; that says : &quot; actually , my Wi@@ k@@ tori@@ a would have to sit in the tenth grade in the gymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; I fill you with a dream . &quot;
to be out of duty ?
who is it@@ ching ?
the fans don &apos;t .
also do not allow Bie@@ ber himself .
this has already taken care of .
&quot; for the advertisement in the advertisement of the super@@ car he c@@ ashed three million , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ im@@ ples company sp@@ illed many , many dollars on the Bie@@ ber account . &quot;
&quot; and with each doll that looks like he and goes over the counter , Bie@@ ber also collects . &quot;
&quot; when J@@ ustin Bie@@ ber drinks a coffee , one wonders at the window @-@ window . &quot;
he is said to have exploited more than 100 million .
some say the hyp@@ e would go too far .
&quot; others stress that , in the US and Great Britain , Bie@@ ber is in number 1 with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bie@@ ber herself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , are not interested in the many zer@@ os first . &quot;
at least he does so .
PE@@ G@@ ID@@ A poster brings a Lebanese idea to Lebanese idea
potatoes or d@@ ön@@ er ?
&quot; both are both - in the potato d@@ ön@@ er , which the Ol@@ denburg I@@ mb@@ al owner has developed Han@@ i Al@@ hay . &quot;
&quot; inspired by the phrase &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ ön@@ er , &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay potato and meat are put together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot;
&quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; Pot@@ atoes , instead of D@@ ön@@ er , &quot; which he had seen acci@@ dentally on television . &quot;
&quot; since then , a barbecue sk@@ ewer is in his store , which is equipped with meat and potatoes . &quot;
&quot; this is multi@@ cul@@ tur@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay . &quot;
the idea has now been registered with the Leb@@ anon@@ ym in the Patent Office in Munich .
&quot; according to the authorities , it has recently been protected as a utility model . &quot;
Al@@ hay does not want to reveal how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains .
&quot; only so much : &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; he finds . &quot;
culinary international understanding also goes well with its customers .
Met@@ cash starts campaign to combat al@@ di@@ - incidence
Met@@ cash tries to protect the I@@ GA branch from an Al@@ di rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a campaign to defend the market share of I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a 700 million $ al@@ di invasion .
&quot; while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia in early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationship with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show . &quot;
&quot; I@@ GA dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA stores and shop owners who sell cheap tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish further details of its defense strategy on September 29 when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment performs its annual investor strategy day . &quot;
&quot; it is much at stake , as South Australia and Western Australia make up almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ &apos;s I@@ GA stores and generate higher profit margins as the Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the Eastern states . &quot;
&quot; purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in eastern Australia . &quot;
&quot; however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will take away around five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after the opening of its first markets and will remove all existing players , but mainly independent retailers . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published this week , analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailer could lose 360 $ million sales per year and Met@@ cash 250 million $ by the end of 2016 . &quot;
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di opens 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA and will generate sales of $ 500 million and € 600 million in each market next year .
&quot; the loss in the food and food business and the amounts on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ &apos;s high fixed cost base could cost Met@@ cash approximately 13 million $ profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time Met@@ cash is losing market shares in the eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA purch@@ as@@ ers are the most loyal . &quot;
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ &apos;s sales in the food and food business fall by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
&quot; last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , at a business dinner in Melbourne , that Met@@ cash is likely to disappear within a decade . &quot;
Met@@ cash declined to publicly respond to the comments by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash took contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
&quot; IG@@ AS &apos;s market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ &apos;s food and food trade , which has approximately 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the operative debt reduction in simultaneous printing on sales and margins . &quot;
&quot; the wholes@@ aler , however , resist@@ s and inv@@ ests more than 150 million dollars to raise sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths for hundreds of products every week to improve their shops through faster growing fresh foods and provide a better selection of private label foods . &quot;
&quot; Met@@ c@@ ash@@ &apos;s main managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and loading refurb@@ ishment programmes are going to grow to El@@ an , hoping that the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017 . &quot;
&quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by President of the Australian tennis Association , Steve He@@ aly . &quot;
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is ear@@ ns praise as criticism for his behaviour .
&quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick C@@ yrene , and according to the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly rather deserves praise as criticism for his own behaviour . &quot;
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ os , who is repeatedly called &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; got into the spotlight with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka &apos;s not@@ orious struggle with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters . &quot;
&quot; in a fi@@ ery qualification game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati , soon after that , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee . Har@@ rison proclaimed : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have had to beat a car , and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cr@@ amp ver@@ ed a potential US Open victory by Richard Flu@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gru@@ oth for second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Great Britain . &quot;
&quot; one thing I &apos;m rather extravag@@ ant about is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn a little into the fight , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost because of a fight in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a ra@@ cket from fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves much recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I believe he was treated a little too tightly . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he adapts to the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is well in shape , he &apos;s a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also made the decision to not take into account the decision to take into consideration the important preliminary decision that starts on Friday , and it describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for all , but it ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term fixed component to the team . &quot;
&quot; first of all , we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not all the controversi@@ es around &#91; C@@ yrene &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he climbs in the eyes of the public , and he has made some aw@@ ful mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions . some time outside the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght he can only think about it , I consider it appropriate and it is best for the team and it is the best for him . &quot;
&quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary announces p@@ light , closes the border , holds refugees back &quot;
Hungary declared the emergency and regulated the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to illeg@@ ally enter the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos ensu@@ ed at the border when hundreds of migrants were accum@@ ulating in a man &apos;s land and re@@ acted to Ser@@ b officials with indignation .
&quot; the people who had fled from violence , stuck for an unknown time in a land strip on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled down there . &quot;
but frustr@@ ations climbed .
&quot; as a police helicopter ho@@ vers over them , the migrants &quot; opened the border ! &quot; and scre@@ amed insul@@ ts against the Hungarian police police . &quot;
some people returned from protest food and water .
Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister stated it is &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a collision damage .
&quot; in the coming days , talks with Brussels and other countries must take place , &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border reached a day after the 28 @-@ Nations block at a controversial meeting in Brussels no common immigration policy could be reconc@@ iled .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who were seeking refuge in the un@@ corrupted Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that in the end - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be that the EU states would take up additional 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit in the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; Hungary , however , did not put its hopes on a bal@@ eful action of Brussels or its neighbors . &quot;
&quot; the emergency stood out in two southern regions on Tuesday , giving authorities more powers to cope with the crisis so they could block streets and speed up asylum procedures . &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to under@@ lined that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country after it has ended a fence on the Serbian border .
&quot; C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates were employed at the race , the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and a gateway to the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most of the upcoming economic refugees are seeking a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 foot ) tall Za@@ us , which allowed the government to build along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also impose greater prison terms for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares its state of emergency &quot; , &quot; said spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porters in the southern town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it very clear : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still agree on the use of the military , expected next week but re@@ porters from Associ@@ ated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people were trying to cross the border , 15 others were already deeper into the country . &quot;
&quot; they come across by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of comm@@ itting crimes under the new laws . &quot;
authorities are quick to repair the fence .
&quot; on Tuesday morning , Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after a train wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders had arrived . &quot;
&quot; chaos embra@@ ced the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container in order to process the data of people and squee@@ ze a crowd to fit there . &quot;
&quot; about 20 succeeded in coming in , but thousands remained outside . &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the main motorway link between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead in front of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey
&quot; the former Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton is still holding a double @-@ digit margin in the democratic race for the nom@@ ination at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her face to ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton now has the support of 47 per cent of the democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent before ) while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is chann@@ eling for the presidential office , receives support of 15 per cent of the democratic voters in the prim@@ aries . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion is determining which candidate they will support . &quot;
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their election than those of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS news survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders scored some gains . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has a big advantage in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have less@@ ened . &quot;
&quot; their support for the men has fallen sharply , and S@@ anders is only back with 5 points . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s benefit with democratic voters under the age of 50 has wi@@ el@@ ded , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , however , has a big advantage with the older voters . &quot;
&quot; last month , Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit margin with the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot;
about half of the democratic voters in the previous elections say that they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
&quot; a quarter would support it with some reservations , and another 15 percent would only support it because it is the candidate . &quot;
they would not support six percent .
it may not be surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are enthusiastic about it .
the views are more mixed with those who do not support Clinton at present - only about a quarter would support them enthusi@@ astically .
&quot; while 48 per cent of the democratic voters of the previous elections say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , fewer Republi@@ can voters say this about their peak candidate Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; if Clin@@ tons supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that it has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman president is ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to dealing with the problems and the eligi@@ bility are also quoted .
&quot; as the Vice President raises the potential for the presidential office to the scales , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic elec@@ tors of the prim@@ aries are asked who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top . &quot;
of Clinton &apos;s supporters say more than half that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far ahead of S@@ anders .
&quot; if Bi@@ den decides not to can@@ on for the nom@@ ination of the democr@@ ats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead in front of S@@ anders increases from 20 points with bi@@ ds in race to 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; Clinton as a candidate sees fifty @-@ five percent of the voters with the best chances to win the election , but this figure has dropped from 78 percent last month . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , on the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about the elec@@ torate . &quot;
&quot; similarly as in the last month , no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters stands out to be unacceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important characteristics for voters of the prim@@ aries of their party .
&quot; maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; bi@@ ds are best cut off with hon@@ esty , while Clinton &apos;s strength is leadership . &quot;
&quot; thirty per cent of the democratic voters don &apos;t believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not have any opinion of him . &quot;
&quot; democratic voters in the prim@@ aries generally also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ideological in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; in all these measurements , about one quarter of the democratic elec@@ torate has no opinion of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; as questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server as Secretary of Foreign Affairs will continue to be asked , most Democratic voters of the previous elections are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not affected their opinions overall . &quot;
but it is a different story in the American public overall .
&quot; half of Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about a third is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said the e @-@ mail controversy had no impact on Clinton &apos;s general opinion , although 36 percent said that their opinion had deterior@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly re@@ public@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say that their views have become worse by Clinton . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is considered honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of their party , this continues to be a problem for them among registered voters : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 percent of those entitled to vote do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
&quot; at the same time , 55 percent of eligible voters throughout the country also see Tru@@ mp as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; Clinton and Tru@@ mp receive good guidance , however . &quot;
&quot; from the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best cut off with hon@@ esty . &quot;
&quot; a majority regards S@@ anders rather than honest , but as with Car@@ son many have no idea of him . &quot;
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections amounts to 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves closer to Donald Tru@@ mp in a nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is close behind Donald Tru@@ mp with the latest C@@ BS News / New York Times survey
&quot; in the meantime , half of the voters &quot; support in the new pol@@ l is eliminated , and others lose support dramatically . &quot;
&quot; Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tru@@ mp nationwide in large numbers . support grows of 23 % in the latest C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News debate last month , 27 % in the pol@@ l of Tuesday . &quot;
but Car@@ son fell from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son was well received by demographic groups and sur@@ passed Tru@@ mp among Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of Charlie Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is beaten with Wis@@ cons@@ ins governor Scott Walker , who has fallen the deepest , and 10 % support last month to now 2 % . &quot;
former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio are 6 % in third place .
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 people from Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey released last week shows that Car@@ son advances in the p@@ olls - with 19 % support in re@@ public@@ ans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support . &quot;
the recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post revealed also Tru@@ mp significantly ahead of Car@@ son .
&quot; looking at a Car@@ son rising in the last week , Tru@@ mp found some hi@@ de@@ away for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s faith . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp last Saturday during a campaign show in I@@ owa . &quot;
pleasant bath temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; even though peak values are only measured in the distance , bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers already have a trip to the Mediterranean to find even hot water . &quot;
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; some people are no longer able to go to the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees Celsius in the North and Baltic Sea this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) shares . &quot;
&quot; bathing temperatures , on the other hand , continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east it can even reach up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic , it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood bur@@ dened with the death of Bar@@ uch &apos;s College @-@ Neul@@ ing
&quot; almost two years after a student died during a gl@@ amor@@ ous ritual of a student union in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges against five persons are submitted . &quot;
&quot; members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si br@@ otherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; &quot; Michael &quot; &quot; den@@ g during an initiation ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , the police shared . &quot;
&quot; officials said he had been loaded with a 30 pound ruck@@ sack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a goal . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about head@@ aches , then he fell unconscious . &quot;
&quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si br@@ otherhood did not call the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was impot@@ ent and reported supposedly an hour before they brought him to a hospital , the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes , goo@@ gling his symptoms and contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to seek advice , &quot; &quot; said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members began to hide things and put the Brotherhood &apos;s well @-@ being on that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; said Poli@@ ph@@ ef Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning at his injuries . &quot;
&quot; after a aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeated with bl@@ unt strength injuries to the head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs . &quot;
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies every year on the ch@@ ic@@ anes , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s family in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held ac@@ countable , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended an indictment for the first five members of the Third Gra@@ des .
&quot; thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ous attacks and formation of a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t just want to blame the people involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or officially - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also hold them ac@@ countable , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; Bar@@ uch &apos;s College has banned the Brotherhood , and the National Brotherhood has rev@@ oked their affili@@ ation to the local group . &quot;
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; a raise of interest comes , and the hous@@ se will fall , yields for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession . &quot;
we know that .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will take and how long it will stop .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy offers only little guidance on how to proceed . &quot;
a recession came within just 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted for 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve at raising interest rates is often , although not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments are re@@ acting . &quot;
&quot; hence , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank so strongly emphasized that investors should not focus on when it begins to raise interest rates , but rather to the period required for normal@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; in the end , market participants could , however , find that all the excitement could possibly be exagger@@ ated because of a raise of interest . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest to normal heights , but still at a very low level to lead to the sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no re@@ perc@@ ussions . &quot;
here is a look at historic trends based on how some areas of the economy might react :
&quot; as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things volati@@ le for a while . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the increase arrives , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there seems to be a tendency that net income yields from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which might reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a newer study on what happened after interest increases in the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; more precisely , the market is in the past 35 years mostly in upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to the increase of interest , rather flat in the 250 days afterwards ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis published by Bob Dol@@ l , head facility strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tends to occur later in the increases cycle and the return on investments starts to decrease .
&quot; rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote it . &quot;
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that did not exist before and could accelerate a recession . &quot;
what is most remarkable is that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point at a interest increase in the F@@ ed .
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest increases since 1950 have only twice the nominal GDP of below 4.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed figures . &quot;
&quot; interest increases in such a fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and throw up the question &quot; whether it &apos;s different this time , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; market participants agreed to raise the F@@ ed all year long , and all eyes were directed to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading has only a probability of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study , all hei@@ gh@@ tening cycles from 1950 to date have taken place in a super cycle with increasing swing in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ essions are quickly put into the shadow after the beginning of recovery , &quot; said the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest , which the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months so far . &quot;
&quot; fixed income was also volati@@ le , as the market anticip@@ ates an increase in interest , and the pattern is rather similar to the capital market . &quot;
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than with shares if they change their strategic course .
loans appear to change the direction once the first increase / decrease occurs in the cycle .
&quot; at the end of the boo@@ sting cycle , the bond yields immediately fall , said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will cause yields to move closer together between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
&quot; high @-@ interest bonds often yield better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still cau@@ tious to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , Jones believes that markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the drop in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , credit tigh@@ tening has expanded and volati@@ lity has risen - all the features of the market if the F@@ ed has intensified its strategy . &quot;
companies in large and large will profit from the greater part of their business activities in the US when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
&quot; multinational companies with high debt will get worse , as an increasing dollar will make their products more expensive on the global market and also finance their debts . &quot;
&quot; history shows that &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; shares tend to be extremely positive for three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot;
&quot; companies with a strong balance sheet exceeded the average of 5 percentage points after each of the interest increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 . &quot;
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity in their stocks also exceeded their equi@@ val@@ ents with lower quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt will be a big problem .
&quot; companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose most , &quot; said Gold@@ man . &quot;
&quot; outside of pure equity , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar . &quot;
&quot; savers could see profits by higher yields , even if experts of different opinion are how quickly that will take place . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says Par@@ liam@@ entary Director Andrew B@@ ingham &quot;
&quot; the Conserv@@ ative Member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the station for its &quot; &quot; stup@@ idity &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly incapable of distingu@@ ishing commercial ri@@ vals .
he also played at the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated the Br@@ its
EP colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins adopted the broadcast The Voice and said that this was not very original .
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns into &quot; Classic FM , &quot; a leading MP and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something that the private sen@@ ders do not . &quot;
&quot; the Conserv@@ ative MP Andrew B@@ ingham said also the BBC @-@ bos@@ ses that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer distingu@@ ishable from its commercial competitors . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; stupid &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; he said . &quot;
he also focused on the BBC Music Awards that started last December .
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be the Br@@ its only under a different name . &quot;
&quot; so if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples where you only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham . &quot;
BBC @-@ General Director rejected the alleg@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and enlightenment .
&quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , I will never learn other about classical music anywhere else . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to give new works on behalf , I think is really important , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that he needed to work harder to engage the audience as it did in the past because the British were less informed about classical music . &quot;
&quot; however , radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing in the committee for the selection of culture , media and sport was under fire to tread the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins grab@@ bed The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was bought by the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of 22 million pounds . &quot;
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as judge - was produced &quot; in particular BBC mode . &quot;
&quot; he added , he wants the company to &quot; find a hit from our own stable , &quot; when the next time there is a series of entertainment . &quot;
&quot; however , he refused to exclude the order of further series of The Voice in the future or to give money to the tax@@ pa@@ yer for other entertainment formats . &quot;
Internet sales increased in August at slow@@ est and Black Friday can be responsible for it
&quot; in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales . &quot;
in the last month there was the lowest score since the beginning of records in 2000 .
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones
experts believe that Black Friday has slow@@ ed down the issues in November
&quot; for over a decade , virtual shopping has bo@@ omed , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns . &quot;
&quot; however , experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures only showed seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot;
the total expenditure on August presented the lowest rise in growth since the start of records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you consider the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always evolved over time , &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index . &quot;
&quot; he explained that online sales increased three years ago , when buyers started making purchases with their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; it meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now this comm@@ utes itself , and we may experience that growth is dimin@@ ishing . &quot;
the Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for declining revenues .
&quot; experts believe that buyers will hold their purchases back to this event , which takes place on the last Friday in November . &quot;
&quot; last year , five times the average number of buyers was running around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some tra@@ der websites fell off . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , where the buyers fought for bar@@ gains , could prevent purch@@ as@@ ers from making purchases . &quot;
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found that £ 5 spent a little over £ 1 online .
&quot; for some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one @-@ third of purchases are now carried out via web shops . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , more than a quarter of people bu@@ ys clothing and shoes online rather than in the fashion stores in the inner cities . &quot;
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca in the crane accident Get@@ ra@@ ted - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the corp@@ ses of 29 dead are borne by Muslims during the first burial in Mec@@ ca by the streets .
Saudi Arabia hur@@ ts the collapse of some of the huge Saudi Bin Laden batch
&quot; the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured , after the crane collap@@ sed &quot;
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the victims who were killed as a crane to Mec@@ ca &apos;s Grand Mo@@ cam@@ ee .
&quot; mour@@ ning filled , largely dressed in white , the way to pay their respect , when the first of the dead entered their last journey to the Al @-@ Mo@@ vies grav@@ ey@@ ard . &quot;
&quot; the procession passed by the Holy Place , where only days before a building crane ran through the ceiling of the mosque and then pl@@ ung@@ ed to the praying . &quot;
&quot; the bodies were released for the funeral , when the Saudi king hung a san@@ ction over the construction company of the Bin Laden family due to the disaster that also left 3@@ 94 injured . &quot;
&quot; the bodies of 29 wor@@ ship@@ pers who were killed , when a crane r@@ ushed through the Great Central Mo@@ sch@@ ee Mek@@ ka , were carried through the streets . &quot;
&quot; among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage , when the crane was down . &quot;
Mr. Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ led in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; Saudi officers have stated firmly that the H@@ add@@ le@@ h will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands , who will continue to go to the city . &quot;
&quot; today King Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden Group , said , would not have stopped the arm of the crane when he was not used . &quot;
an Arab version of the decree issued by the state Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden Group was co @-@ responsible for the collapse .
&quot; the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company abroad is prohibited . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man promised to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which pl@@ ung@@ ed into a courtyard of the Great Mo@@ cam@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ led , who later took place this month . &quot;
&quot; the Bin Laden Group has not issued any statements about the breakdown of the crane , and its representatives were not available for comment . &quot;
the Royal Dec@@ ree also ad@@ mits the group because of not current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes around Mec@@ ca &apos;s grand mo@@ z@@ ee as part of the massive construction project led by the Bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden family has been associated with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over major construction projects .
&quot; the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was an apost@@ ate son , who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 &quot; s . &quot;
&quot; the fall of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage which is necessary at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims . &quot;
officials said that 158 people remain in the hospital .
government officials arranged that 1 million ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4.000 ) were to be paid to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanent injured .
other injured are given half of this amount .

&quot; it is said that Brit@@ ons lay down their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favor of the use of qualified Eastern European tra@@ des@@ men , who carry out their work in their homes . &quot;
&quot; if you can deal with a hammer or a brush to paint walls , you seem to be a minority nowadays . &quot;
&quot; the British are increasingly employing tra@@ des@@ people to perform DIY jobs in their homes , says the head of the company behind B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , the new CEO of King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the construction market chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe who offer services at low prices has now been over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , King@@ f@@ isher plans to open 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix Shops , aimed at craftsmen and close 60 sales points of B &amp; Q . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wanted to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops because eight out of ten purchase decisions are made by women .
&quot; at the moment , men out@@ weigh the men . &quot;
&quot; she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends , which show more female single households that do more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
we have to shift this more strongly towards equilibrium .
&quot; in principle , half of our customers consist of women with 80 percent of the choices about buying articles by women . &quot;
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a UK in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 index , has also re@@ structured their top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions . &quot;
King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that occupies almost 50 percent of the team with women including its management and Chief Financial Officer .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
King@@ F@@ isher posted a decline in half @-@ year earnings and revenues after the Group deb@@ ated the cost of closing the shops .
&quot; because of the trend , King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches . &quot;
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ ob for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
&quot; at the Landes@@ gericht Kla@@ gen@@ furt on Wednesday , two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball vice champion A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and abor@@ tion . &quot;
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them had also been charged with abuse of office .
&quot; from this alleg@@ ation , he has been acqu@@ itted in force in May . &quot;
the current trial was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
&quot; according to the At@@ tor@@ ney @-@ General Robert Ri@@ ffel , in the years 2006 to 2011 , the defend@@ ants had collected funds from association accounts , which they were allowed to dispose of in their functions , for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; the damage is estimated at around 400@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the sports officials are also accused of financial off@@ ence .
&quot; this fact was the chair of the Sho@@ oting Council , Ju@@ dge Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it should be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; for the off@@ ence of the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence presented that the association did not create an asset in any time . &quot;
&quot; the sports officials only charged expenses and the sports club , for whom they had been active from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested a lot of time and money - the liabilities in 2001 amounted to some 600@@ ,000 sh@@ ill@@ ings ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 € ) . &quot;
&quot; back then , we stood before the situation : do we pass the club further or block us ? &quot; , &quot; said one of the defend@@ ants , in the bread@@ board of large @-@ scale account@@ ants of the financial sector . &quot;
&quot; with his co @-@ worker and co @-@ defend@@ ant , he then decided to take over this task . &quot;
with all risks .
&quot; we shot money , put our life insurance on the bench as security , &quot; &quot; he said at the arrival . &quot;
&quot; it has been agreed with the association : you can freely manage the money , it is not allowed to make any debts . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , with corresponding financial success , the withdraw@@ als of the expense allowance had been eff@@ ected retro@@ actively until 1991 . &quot;
&quot; therefore , only years later , since 2003 , one has paid off a portion of the allowance expenses , namely from 2003 when a plus has been on the account . &quot;
&quot; therefore , l@@ ump sum and not detail bookings appeared , the former chairman explained the operations . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and savings accounts managed the two defend@@ ants together , said the second accused . &quot;
&quot; why the payments were not disclosed to the association in detail , the judge asked . &quot;
&quot; the association did not concern itself in detail for financial support , it was important only to have the freedom of debt , the answer . &quot;
&quot; as in 2011 against the one of the function@@ ary investigations into account of abuse , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account . &quot;
&quot; these were appropri@@ ations , the defend@@ ants asser@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; this securities account ran on the name of the second defend@@ ant , and was not known to the association according to his statement . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot;
the respon@@ dent had no answer for a long time .
&quot; then he said , he believed that this was the best for the club . &quot;
&quot; if something had happened to him , no one would have known anything of that money , the prosec@@ utor placed in the room . &quot;
&quot; the accused was informed , the function@@ ary was justified . &quot;
&quot; this transfer was formulated as a &quot; &quot; damage compensation &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; why indem@@ n@@ ity ? , judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know . &quot;
the first defend@@ ant declared that he had not agreed with this formulation because the association had never been damaged .
&quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; With him all of you are of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the function@@ ary , he never obtained a cent salary , he only calculated o@@ dom@@ eter money and diets . &quot;
&quot; he charged the association 1,000 euros per month , but the actual expenses were much higher , he added . &quot;
the defend@@ ants were not able to show accurate documents for the early years .
&quot; they were no longer retained after an audit in which everything was judged correct , they declared . &quot;
mil@@ eage also had the second defend@@ ant .
&quot; all the moves were made in cash , so he had to go to the Bank to Blei@@ burg from his home town , he explained in his statement . &quot;
the trial will continue on 23 September with the questioning of witnesses .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard reaches another 30.000 jobs
&quot; in addition to the staff cuts that have been running for three years , the Compu@@ terri@@ fic will be able to reduce further jobs during the company spl@@ itting up . &quot;
the inter@@ sections of the US Compu@@ terri@@ fic H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) are no end .
&quot; as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to reduce the reduction of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer segment . &quot;
&quot; as a result , costs in the amount of $ 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) will be saved , divided the company on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the step will lead to a special load of around $ 2.7 billion , which will be incurred from the fourth quarter . &quot;
&quot; the dis@@ assembly of 55@@ ,000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 , HP had approximately 30@@ 2,000 employees . &quot;
the H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Share was issued on the stock exchange for 2.3 percent .
&quot; the company , which has become a large @-@ scale group from California &apos;s Pal@@ o Alto , is currently spl@@ itting up : this is how the computer and printer business will be bund@@ led in a new company - separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services . &quot;
both parts of the business will be listed on the stock exchange .
&quot; a again dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales , as well as a weaker demand from corporate customers according to his services , set the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo last . &quot;
&quot; in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , sales of PC and printers decreased by 11.@@ 5 percent . &quot;
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
revenues declined in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP answers with a split and massive inter@@ change on the changes in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has only recently re@@ acted that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and doing business online more and more .
&quot; Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans fores@@ ee a total breakdown of around 55@@ ,000 jobs . &quot;
conflicts : majority supports anti @-@ IS training mission
&quot; the direct involvement of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq , however , would mainly result in rejection : 54 percent argued against it , 35 percent agreed to agree . &quot;
the fact that other countries fly air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria are 61 percent positive .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; a co @-@ operation with the Syrian leader Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad covers 51 percent of respon@@ dents , 20 percent would be for this . &quot;
29 per cent were not able to decide .
car : second press day at the 6@@ 6th IAA
&quot; at the heart of the exhibition stand up to 27 September connected , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars and electro@@ mobility . &quot;
&quot; after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show under the motto &quot; Mobility links &quot; on Thursday . &quot;
the general public can visit the IAA from Saturday .
&quot; as before two years ago , the organisers of the V@@ DA car association count with some 900 000 visitors . &quot;
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : outbreak of violence on Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police deployed several hundred refugees on the Serbian border at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and wat@@ cher .
&quot; Euron@@ ews correspon@@ dent , D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k , witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point . &quot;
he reported on the phone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind the police a police line was formed and a wat@@ cher stood behind the police officers .
&quot; 40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials . &quot;
the officials initially set an un@@ interrupted pe@@ pper@@ spray .
afterwards the police used tear gas .
much tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now withdrawn a bit .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone .
&quot; children , who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas , cried out . &quot;
other refugees s@@ cour@@ ged themselves together and suffered under the breath of breath .
the Serbian police press spokes@@ persons suffered injuries by using tear gas and pepper spray .
time to decide on interest rates for the US central bank
&quot; the world is watching if the US bank@@ note comes together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make an important decision whether for the first time since nearly a decade the interest rates are raised or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey among 80 econom@@ ists inter@@ viewed by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half , the last week of view was that the F@@ ed will continue to pers@@ ist and the interest rates on the current level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent will be maintained . &quot;
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest sat on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ isation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , Head of Staff at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the US economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less crude outlook on global circumstances . &quot;
&quot; it warned the markets to stop increasing , but the signs point out that the odds against such a step are good . &quot;
the decision is scheduled to be announced at 8 PM CE@@ T on Thursday
&quot; ap@@ ologi@@ ze for death at the Delta State University , &quot;
&quot; after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , on Monday morning - and before he later shot his colleague and killed - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was sorry &quot; at the first murder and , &quot; he could make it happen , &quot; gave authorities known on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , professor of ge@@ ography and social science education at the Delta State University , called the emergency telephone number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning &quot;
&quot; and said he had shot on a man , and he killed a man . &quot;
Lamb told the staff of the emergency call center that the police had to send police officers to his home .
&quot; he said , &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; is in the house , but that &quot; no one will distur@@ b &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the c@@ aller for his name , but he did not give him . &quot;
Lamb had no explanation for his shots .
&quot; when the police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ att@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written notice from Lamb , 45 , who said : &quot; I am so sorry , I wanted , I could undo it . &quot;
I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman ever loved .
&quot; after writing the note , Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor for history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen killed him . &quot;
&quot; President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday that Lamb supposedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday , there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said that she had been married for about seven years , was described as a &quot; good man . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who is 19 , and she is &quot; &quot; destroyed &quot; &quot; on the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had their daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ls who owned a dog named Light@@ ning have met Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; Know@@ les said . &quot;
&quot; the police said that Lamb had called relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; he is not going to prison . &quot;
&quot; when polic@@ eman took him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later on that night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot . &quot;
&quot; in the spring of 2015 , Lamb received a PhD degree from the Delta State University , like his life lau on the University &apos;s website . &quot;
stars that have lost their lucky charm
&quot; the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years . &quot;
&quot; in 2001 , he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , for cancer . &quot;
&quot; the actor also re@@ port@@ edly has to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug possession . &quot;
all this certainly demands his tribute .
Eu@@ row@@ ning : Lufthansa is building the company
the Lufthansa is planning a large group restructuring .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year by itself with a better organisation .
&quot; 150 of the approximately 1,000 executives worldwide will cost the workplace . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , there are new negotiations with the pilot &apos;s union . &quot;
the Lufthansa is building its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the low @-@ cost Eu@@ row@@ ings .
&quot; the aim of the real@@ ignment is a contribution of € 500 million per year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , divided the airline on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; among other things , there is no longer a Management Board for the passenger business in the future . &quot;
the low @-@ cost airline Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independently as possible .
&quot; in future , Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ rov@@ ings in the management team headed by Chef Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r . &quot;
&quot; with the new order , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ning , with which the company plans to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future . &quot;
&quot; until now , the organization of the 120@@ ,000 employees has been complex . &quot;
&quot; the airline operates under the umbrella of the Passage Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros . &quot;
new negotiations with the pilots
&quot; in the wage conflict with the cockpit adjustment cockpit ( VC ) , the negotiations are to be resum@@ ed on Thursday after the j@@ ammed strike . &quot;
it divided the union with them .
the theme of the talks should be the retirement system for pilots .
&quot; in a year with a predicted recru@@ iting result , the cockpit was &quot; as fast as possible &quot; to achieve wear@@ able results . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , the conflict between union and airline has led to various strikes . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the transitional provision of the pilot , the &quot; Wings &quot; austerity concept is in the background . &quot;
&quot; in the fight against competitor routes , Lufthansa has shifted distances to the group &apos;s own low @-@ cost airline Eu@@ rov@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; under the title &quot; &quot; Mor@@ ning in the South &quot; , &quot; Le@@ ena Kr@@ ü@@ ger &apos;s paintings can be seen in the Künst@@ l@@ erhaus . &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play for months due to double frac@@ ture
&quot; in the Champions League defeat of Manchester , Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven . &quot;
&quot; while this brought the left foreign minister to tears and to exclude him for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a reck@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old sha@@ w was broken into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before being taken to hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double missi@@ le score and is in the hospital . &quot;
he will be moved tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester .
&quot; it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very hard and then fantastic , and then that happens . &quot;
in the dressing room he had an oxygen mask .
he cried .
&quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture then it takes six months , and it will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to escape a red card and the suspension of a mil@@ lim@@ eter .
&quot; Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not punish the Mex@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
van Ga@@ al gu@@ essed that the Italian Ar@@ bit@@ er had er@@ red .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; a tweet on Sha@@ ws account watched : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I come back more strongly . &quot;
&quot; related to this : Manchester United is suffering the loss of Luke Sha@@ w during the defeat of PS@@ V , &quot;
&quot; with the European Championship in France , the British distributor has an additional incentive to recover until the coming June . &quot;
&quot; Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
&quot; when a player leaves the place with this type of injury , everyone is very sad about it . &quot;
it is never the intention of our players to hurt a opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is very difficult because it wasn &apos;t his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; Co@@ c@@ u said . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball that was in a different direction , so it looked as if he had touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said , &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be . &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to the hospital - after a b@@ oul@@ der by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t take long before you know it almost mem@@ orized . &quot;
unless you are perhaps David Cameron .
&quot; when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister decided on The Lor@@ ax , the environmental label published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book I like to read my children , because it seems to be a picture or a message that we have missed so far . &quot;
&quot; everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph in which Cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book , instead re @-@ giving a table of content of the 2012 film version , added the new characters and details to expand the rather short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature is gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree . &quot;
&quot; as if this were not yet suspi@@ cious enough : the text presented by Cameron is partly reflected in the summary of the Lor@@ ax film , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and so begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he ad@@ mits to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is familiar with the plot of the book . here , an un@@ named young man , like the local environment by the money @-@ gre@@ edy , trees fal@@ si@@ fying , Th@@ need stri@@ ck@@ stering Once @-@ ler , despite the protests of the name @-@ giving Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ wit@@ ching , whis@@ ky being , &quot; &quot; speaking in the name of the trees &quot; , &quot; is devast@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who had not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row . &quot;
a Down@@ ing Street spokesperson said that the text had probably come from Cameron &apos;s electoral agency .
&quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff , but gave no further direct comments . &quot;
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team but it is still hard
&quot; hitting Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if one sees the cad@@ res that England has chosen for the tour , a repetition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map . &quot;
I wouldn &apos;t exclude a forward victory .
&quot; A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks section may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the setting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars from 2012 , just a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali develops as spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown quantity on the test plane , is an option for the attack . &quot;
related news : Adam Ly@@ th is leaving the England test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
&quot; the decision to release Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , difficult to analyse for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire . &quot;
&quot; during his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are oriented to results . &quot;
&quot; there were no question marks at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I told this before - players are their own best sel@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; long ago , the course of Ly@@ th would have been extended , but he had control of his own fate . &quot;
&quot; if he hopefully suggests further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes . &quot;
&quot; the England @-@ coach Tre@@ vor Ba@@ yl@@ iss thank@@ ed his attitude , even if he didn &apos;t get so good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man . &quot;
the question of how much time a test drummer gets to put his character is difficult .
&quot; Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him , while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine . &quot;
only comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and forward .
the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England first sat down in the Caribbean -- when Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
&quot; Alex H@@ ales came in , and he is a drummer , whom I in@@ scribe high . &quot;
&quot; he is an X @-@ factor Cri@@ cket player , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge place , which met us very much . &quot;
&quot; he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this depends naturally on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea of letting Mo@@ een beat alongside Cook , which would provide an extra spin @-@ bow@@ ler and would receive four qui@@ cks appeared , and I have nothing against it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ h@@ ander has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of Cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; mos@@ ques might not have done his job for his county Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is number 3 for them , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my former team @-@ mate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as op@@ ener in 2001 .
he immediately made three hundred races and did not look back .
&quot; Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes back to the Ka@@ der as back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited deal@@ ings with him he was very impressed as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may see his stat@@ s - 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup spi@@ der that raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England has made some smart additions to the trainer &apos;s staff . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ shi@@ dene , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a coup . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game , who will bring a wealth of experience , as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes to the white sphere phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful commitment to the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the changing rooms , even if the messages are in line with the previously said . &quot;
&quot; Coll@@ ey &apos;s team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the One @-@ Da@@ yers , R@@ oot got a similar break against Australia and I didn &apos;t have a problem for my part . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but coaches and team @-@ makers do not determine the schedule . &quot;
and you must remember that as with the players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made light hearted .
the Bre@@ x@@ it stock ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit from the EU ) could gain access if the economy goes into a smart device by 2017
&quot; David Cameron &apos;s un@@ equi@@ vocal ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting deeper into trouble with every day , even without the choice of brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , who fought hard for Europe on Tuesday . &quot;
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ acy enthusi@@ astically said that some member states are deeply mired in various crises , such as the EU , and not always from their own guilt , Britain itself created agenda with split concessions and disrup@@ tive contractual changes that they usually do not want . &quot;
&quot; in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if it end@@ angers social protection . &quot;
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and finance ministers climb on summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say they win allies for reforms . &quot;
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; my European friend , who wants an outside @-@ looking UK inside the EU tent - &quot; L@@ ass us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where they don &apos;t care whether we stay or go . &quot;
&quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s cau@@ tious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as it has happened in the over @-@ the @-@ length endurance like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
French François Hollande is looking forward to his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
he is also a f@@ ading power .
&quot; Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left one . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to imagine that they are going to rip a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most of the similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot;
&quot; therefore , some such ministers may even deliberately not plan helpful comments , quite in SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s refer@@ enda campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , susp@@ ects my boy@@ friend . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankrupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Britain has won nothing of the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; Europeans know how predat@@ ory Fle@@ et Street can be at its expense and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the Pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one , as they did during the referendum , inspired by Tony Ben@@ n in 1975 , but did not support our 1973 admission with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; you can weak@@ ly remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro opport@@ uni@@ sts , who made a name for a &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade @-@ Ban@@ ana &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; with all his ins@@ anity , Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were . &quot;
&quot; this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing villa@@ ins , tel@@ ev@@ ised ali@@ ens and the pseudo @-@ non @-@ nation@@ als that most of our large newspapers possess . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her , but noticed that when you sit in a cage with a hot Gor@@ illa , you &apos;d better distribute ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of going to his lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; indeed , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ i@@ ri@@ ans than Bla@@ ir himself when he resist@@ ed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had rejected the principle of the un@@ approved constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which gave him a backdoor . &quot;
the press has never forgiven him .
&quot; but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly kl@@ aps on my back on Monday - I told him that he had no time to waste time for me - seems to repeat N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch strategy of the 80 @-@ s , a mistake then and today . &quot;
&quot; it can last but it must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r whose BBC &apos;s sofa he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position on Europe is - I &apos;m feeling friendly - in the development .
he says we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; now , most people outside U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional blu@@ ep@@ rint and wild Gef@@ il@@ ds of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ men can say yes to everyone . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television this week said that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the 70 @-@ year @-@ old when his old father tried to be loyal to his UK Labour Cab@@ inet colleagues , without going too far and losing his cabinet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and de@@ pu@@ ties on their cl@@ auses on Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; what ever wants to convey the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n - remember that he even touched me - News discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock , and above all in the whirlpool of the social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron a free ticket for Europe that allows him to give Lab@@ ours support in the refer@@ enda &apos;s campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said it . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks for sure .
&quot; but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities for EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite siege economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities to NATO - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not launch a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try , in all , a sense of their superi@@ ors at home . &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspi@@ cious voters - to make concessions to the British if all this can be meaning@@ less ?
&quot; the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , in Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded of at the start on Monday that was called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum . &quot;
experts critici@@ ze public health report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; claims of a state @-@ financed agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , partly with links to tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
Lanc@@ et joined the experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( p@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
he published the &quot; Basic Report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; extraordinarily wind@@ y base &quot; on which p@@ he founded his most important conclusion .
two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims &quot; on stone or sand are built . &quot;
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of effectiveness . &quot;
they said the public anticip@@ ates that &quot; the current best estimate is that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
&quot; indeed , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a multi @-@ criteria decision analysis ( Multi@@ C@@ riteri@@ a Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) in order to develop their opinions on the damages of various ni@@ cot@@ ine containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summ@@ arized in a research report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously received British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot;
&quot; he also signed the references of BA@@ T to public health in a sustainability report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants at the meeting stated to receive funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the funding they have received after reports previously from the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International added . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for selecting the members of the committee are not delivered , but there are several known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which also provide a sector financing in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the meeting also took part in the board of p@@ he .
&quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; signi@@ fies &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; hard evidence of most products for most criteria , &quot; &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these links or restrictions will be discussed in the p@@ he report . &quot;
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that the claims of p@@ he that &quot; there has so far been no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes were used as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers . &quot;
&quot; Prof. Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well @-@ being at p@@ he said that the alleg@@ ations of BM@@ J had already been re@@ acted before . &quot;
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are essentially less harmful than smoking .
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies in his addiction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; he has the clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence proves and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion over the relative dangers in comparison with tobacco . &quot;
&quot; nearly 80@@ ,000 people die yearly from a disease with reference to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year . &quot;
&quot; by suggest@@ ing current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we meet our national jurisdiction . &quot;
BBC should quit East@@ En@@ ders says former head of Channel 4
&quot; the former president of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not broadcast by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers .
&quot; he critici@@ zed the BBC for placing public @-@ law programs , which are probably seen by a smaller audience , in hard controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and of transm@@ it@@ ters such as BB@@ C@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC CEO , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he had been trying to get in touch with the BBC for six years in his time with Channel 4 . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which would also clearly be shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the Ober@@ haus communication committee as part of his investigation on the BBC &apos;s future . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to keep the broadcast fee , which I do not consider medium or long term for a good idea , you should at least put your production on programs that others do not do or commission . &quot;
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve as wide as possible support for their future .
&quot; the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s non@@ sense of course . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said , &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax program financing programs that could be financed without subsidies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions . &quot;
&quot; honestly , other channels would give their right arm for it . &quot;
I want to see how this should be public @-@ legal television .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC ever .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepreneur for series that headed Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC was to blame for the ambi@@ tions of people working there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC show what the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , proposed in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows how East@@ En@@ ders should sell shows . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they can argue , if they go to their apparent missions to justify the justification of 4 billion £ broadcasting fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; for the broadcast fee , Johnson said to the committee : &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value from this . &quot;
&quot; of course , you think everyone thinks that you get a great value for £ 150 a year , but for people who are a lot of money for the 150 £ a year , ask me if that &apos;s true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 chief David El@@ stein , who also testified before the committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check its Eth@@ ics Mission to educ@@ ate , train and enter@@ tain . &quot;
&quot; he said that only little of the BBC production would now officially be classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should take an example in &quot; &quot; inform , enligh@@ ten and talk about this in public law TV channels in Australia and Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the issue of partnerships El@@ stein said that the BBC should do more in areas such as the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of TV will be shown , and with the commercial transm@@ it@@ ters alliances to make all available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound impulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems that can be controlled from break@@ outs of sound waves .
the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment in which they are radi@@ ated with sound impulses that have high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
&quot; the impulses work through the switching on of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells , which are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves . &quot;
further on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetics , in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the deep brain stimulation , a invasive procedure that releases electric impulses in the brain of people to treat symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; round@@ worms generally do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani states that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic bubbles . &quot;
&quot; the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which then penetrate into the worms . &quot;
&quot; the ampli@@ fied ultras@@ onic waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels , and found in the membranes of some of the worms . &quot;
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to such a report Nature Communications .
&quot; in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , the Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms so that some of their Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ones carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels . &quot;
&quot; when using ultrasound to the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ blo@@ wers and transferred into the worms , where they turn on the changed mother@@ boards . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground@@ breaking tool that allows scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said Son@@ o@@ genetics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , which needs to be sent down to the desired spot in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves can happen un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the targeted human neur@@ ons temporarily vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

the 300 posters are by artists who have exhibited their work in the Museum of gru@@ es@@ ome designs in ban@@ sys D@@ ism@@ aland .
&quot; a collective with the name Special Pat@@ rol Group helped to distribute in London and used &quot; Ad Space H@@ ack P@@ acks , &quot; a 6 £ Pack of Allen keys , claiming that &quot; access to around a third of bus stops across the planet are gaining access . &quot; &quot;

&quot; V@@ C@@ CP Creative Director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around advertising for the trade fair - through a void of the Ce@@ L calendar - and thought : &quot; &quot; we give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
&quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic , shad@@ y corporate advertisement , but &quot; through the blu@@ ep@@ rint with bright colors and animation it remains stronger . &quot;
&quot; they have done a fantastic job by helping us to raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture appliances at the fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty . &quot;
what we need now is a step by the British government and the guarantee that torture instruments are not illeg@@ ally traded on our door@@ step .

eight golden rules for living in student residence halls
&quot; eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old I moved to a student residence , still believing in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those I have anger@@ ed - and to the numerous , long @-@ lasting complaints about others . &quot;
most of what I &apos;ve learned can be disti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the entrance in student residence halls ranges from slightly annoying to absolutely frigh@@ tening .
&quot; it &apos;s temp@@ ting to tie : people tell where you come from , whether and where you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ year , where you are in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you don &apos;t love or hate you , because in ear@@ nest , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
&quot; it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like unlike those with whom you would not speak , even if your eyel@@ ashes were burning and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be . &quot;
leave people .
&quot; people often turn into drinks reception , film night venues and community meeting points , but they are also places where people dress up and wear their under@@ wear . &quot;
referring to this : do not remember to start with a relationship at university
intro@@ ver@@ ted receive a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; your room should be a refuge , but many student residen@@ ces form a space @-@ to @-@ room stroll culture which is friendly and social and can lead to lifel@@ ong friendship . &quot;
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
&quot; nothing in culture allows you to say , &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I get the energy that I have consumed for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student of con@@ vivi@@ ality is exhausted - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
apro@@ pos kno@@ cking : do it .
a guy in my student residen@@ ces had the idea that an un@@ locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by che@@ eks .
&quot; as you start the university at the high point of back @-@ man@@ ia , kno@@ cking on the doors of people to present yourself with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es is less wei@@ rd than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ ies &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I made you a little baked . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course this depends on whether you are a decent bakery .
&quot; bad mixed lum@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat cause people to turn asleep when you drop . &quot;
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student residen@@ ces .
&quot; of course , the c@@ law of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea also ? &quot;
check this with the owner of the milk .
&quot; chances are good that they say to use themselves , even if they cook inside . &quot;
&quot; if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it is annoying and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it more balanced than my room@@ mate added to her milk a pur@@ ge to punish thi@@ eves . &quot;
she is now in prison .
they should not make noise that keeps people from sleep or work .
&quot; it &apos;s not just about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people who sit in the glas@@ sh@@ ouse in the tru@@ est sense of the word . &quot;
&quot; a girl in my hall asked her neighbors whether it makes up something for them to make something qui@@ eter to them , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
they responded with even more loud music .
&quot; when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly left her neighbors for two hours before she left her own music , shut her door and went to her three hour test . &quot;
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would enter the same student residence random@@ ly ?
&quot; on the other hand , it wouldn &apos;t be bot@@ her@@ some for you to keep a room@@ mate for your future spouse , reti@@ re , separate them and then see them each day , and perhaps experience how they bring together all common friends to themselves ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes on its own ways - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try to persu@@ ade your sub@@ mis@@ e a little reason . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment you notice that someone has left its keys in his un@@ locked room , the border between a Ul@@ k and mo@@ b@@ bing is fin@@ er than it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good stroke is funny , but it takes only moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
give by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson on safety - but don &apos;t forget someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door and place your keys in a glass of water that you put into the freezer - but cr@@ ush their possessions on the ceiling not more than twice .
&quot; terra@@ ced houses for refugees , single @-@ persons , &quot;
the real estate contractor Markus Gil@@ dner builds holiday houses for people who don &apos;t have much money in the Eck@@ ental Quar@@ ters for people who do not have much money .
&quot; thus , for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need the living space , but also the only educ@@ ative mother and the poor servant . &quot;
&quot; I show how to buy cheap and good today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview &quot;
thousands of refugees will be forced onto the housing market .
the business@@ man Markus Gil@@ deb@@ tor believes in knowing how quickly cheaper living space can be created : it builds in a project town@@ houses for refugees .
&quot; Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for the people stay here for a great part .
&quot; in view of the flow of refugees , we need enough living space over the next few decades . &quot;
&quot; a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution . &quot;
guil@@ d : a terra@@ ced house needs the least place .
it facilitates integration .
&quot; this is different , if you put the people in blocks . &quot;
&quot; each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a lounge . &quot;
&quot; it can be that many refugees will say it is peace again , I go back . &quot;
then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their needs .
how high are the costs ?
&quot; guil@@ d : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 18@@ 4 000 euros , without property . &quot;
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction lasted six months .
this is appropriate .
have the building regulations complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : I have gone through my project correctly .
&quot; especially complicated , it always makes the im@@ pending Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the Stell@@ platz@@ tage Regulation . &quot;
cre@@ ep@@ y .
&quot; it is still signed , who in a terra@@ ced house creates three apartments , needs at least three pitches . &quot;
only in the cities is the place missing .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
guil@@ d : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
which is definitely not right .
but do you not exac@@ erb@@ ate the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : it &apos;s true : in the last five years we had a construction boom in Germany , but built up luxury apartments that hardly any more can afford . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , even the normal people need living space . &quot;

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS if Apple update is released
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the settings app , tap &quot; General &quot; and then select &quot; software update . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it is ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install . &quot;
&quot; some have encountered problems after installation , as they get an error message stating that the &quot; &quot; software update failed &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to b@@ ypass the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush goes back or trying to update via iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
&quot; this may mean del@@ eting apps to make room - but Apple has made it more impro@@ b@@ able by reducing the updates . likewise , it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process is finished . &quot;
&quot; it is worthwhile to make sure that your mobile phone is charged during the update , or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged . &quot;
&quot; if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to be continued , as the phone may switch on half way and lead to an abor@@ tion of the update . &quot;

Ros@@ enberg &apos;s only motto : full Att@@ acks
&quot; N@@ ico Ros@@ berg knows in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes @-@ team @-@ mate Lewis Hamilton , only one motto : &quot; full Att@@ acks . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the World Cup 2nd stressed before the start into the decisive seven overseas races , &quot; that I have nothing left to lose . &quot; &quot;
53 points separate the vice world champion before the race in Singapore on this Sunday by defending champion and two @-@ way champion Hamilton .
&quot; the Br@@ ite already won seven of the twelve season races so far , taking the floo@@ d@@ light grand pri@@ x in the city state as a favorite . &quot;
2009 and last year the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Brit@@ on was able to win the race .
whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will have influence on the Grand Prix of Singapore is still unclear .

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; &quot; club , which was founded three months ago , has added another member to its ranks , thus increasing the number of members to 19 players . &quot;
&quot; the new member is the entrepreneur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player , who stayed for more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen . &quot;
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the bearer of the Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz 1 . class and honorary citizen of the towns of Esp@@ el@@ kam@@ p and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
&quot; G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann has supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation , which Chairman Alfred Klein met . &quot;
&quot; thus , it is possible to record chess players who cannot raise the membership fee . &quot;
youth work and talent research should also be promoted .
&quot; G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; &quot; is seen as an expression of his solidarity with the spa town . &quot;
district office seeks direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the geri@@ atric centre Anton@@ isti@@ ft have joined together under the umbrella of the social foundation and opened a new contact point at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
&quot; in addition to deliber@@ ations , you can also participate in courses . &quot;
the social foundation pul@@ ls it down from the mountain into the inner city .
&quot; more specifically , the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz . &quot;
a new district office was recently opened there .
&quot; here , immediately next to the shopping market , elderly and couns@@ ell@@ ors receive information on questions such as care insurance or services of health and nursing homes . &quot;
&quot; for years , we have been working with our ambul@@ ant nursing staff that often care@@ gi@@ vers are left alone . &quot;
there are endless questions .
&quot; not in@@ frequently many services of the insur@@ ances are not used , because the complexity of the insurance companies is hardly understood , &quot; explained the new owner Jutta Wei@@ g@@ and , who was also responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the hospital hospital as well as for the ambul@@ ant service &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the advice , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness . &quot;
&quot; to this end , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat . &quot;
&quot; therefore , additional offers such as fall prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapeu@@ tic treatment can be used . &quot;
the offers of the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis supplement in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis is responsible for prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; described Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot;
the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre sees both business leaders particularly in demographic change .
this makes a good de@@ centralized infrastructure indispensable in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future .
&quot; in addition , according to mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) at the inauguration celebrations , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the agreement in old age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers in the programme , and they invite to a regular soci@@ able supplement . &quot;
&quot; thus , the social foundation makes a big contribution that sen@@ iors can live independently and well in their familiar surroundings . &quot;
&quot; the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturday from 10 a.m. to noon . &quot;

men beating on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
&quot; witnesses seek the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 hrs , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , one from the group , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afghan , followed according to the police his two friends at a distance of about five meters and shou@@ ted to them that one could wait for him . &quot;
at this point the group was at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three persons on the site of the petrol station .
&quot; one of these men was crying out to the young people , and struck this man with his fist . &quot;
the victim suffered a frac@@ ture of the nose and bleeding heavily from the nose .
&quot; when his two friends ha@@ st@@ ened and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ cket , he left his victim at first . &quot;
from his friends the injured young man was brought home now .
the perpetr@@ ator followed the group with a passenger car to the apartment and travelled there demonstr@@ atively several times .
&quot; when you didn &apos;t see the car any more , the injured was in front of the building to smoke a cigarette . &quot;
there he was attacked again by the ra@@ cket and another male person .
&quot; by means of a head@@ stock , one reviewed the face and the thi@@ ghs of the victim . &quot;
the injured had to be hospit@@ alized for medical care .
&quot; to date , only a vag@@ ue item description is available . &quot;

Dr. Frank Müller to acquire Fel@@ steh@@ eat and invest 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ eat .
&quot; also the Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor , Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert . &quot;
&quot; in many places in the country doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , is lucky : there Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of field breaks on October 1 . &quot;
&quot; during Ur@@ sel Fiel@@ d@@ hausen in retirement , her husband , Karl @-@ Heinrich , is still on the side of his successor in the coming months . &quot;
&quot; after a conversion period , Müller opens the practice on October 12 , until then he will invest 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros in the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was sympathy at first sight , when Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l met , who are currently completing their medical training in the Ver@@ den Hospital and will also come into practice last year . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the mil@@ ler would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ aus and laughs . &quot;
&quot; when it was time , I just called them . &quot;
the couple mil@@ ler liked the idea of continuing their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot;
&quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
&quot; as an advantage , he also sees his own boss as soon as possible . &quot;
and so they agreed that the mil@@ ler bought the house with the practice .
&quot; however , they will continue to live in Vil@@ sen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; there , the tw@@ o@@ fold family father Frank Müller has also grown up , his medical studies in Hannover followed stations in several medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; he is currently active as a Senior Physi@@ cian in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed Senior Physi@@ cian in Di@@ ep@@ holz and voluntarily works in the DR@@ K @-@ prepar@@ edness of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; starting September 19th , the practice is being prepared for the new boss . &quot;
&quot; while Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ steh@@ ausen works as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( intern@@ ist ) has specialised in gastro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the mil@@ ler , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle as a resident doctor . &quot;
&quot; end@@ os@@ copy comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot;
&quot; after the reconstruction , the rooms will look more modern . &quot;
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and load EK@@ Gs and need a talk room more .
&quot; in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed . &quot;
&quot; a subsi@@ dy of a total of 50,000 euros is provided by the land@@ fill in the framework of a subsi@@ dy programme from the administrative district ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is continued , &quot; &quot; said Bernd Bor@@ mann , the German citizen . &quot;
&quot; according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 2000 patients come into practice in the field of field breaks every quarter , in the North German average practice it is about 500 . &quot;
there is another dentist &apos;s office in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
a positive side effect of the practice takeover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf according to Ur@@ sel Fiel@@ d@@ hausen .
&quot; if no successor had found himself , she would have gone . &quot;
&quot; by the way , anyone visiting Müll@@ ers &apos;s consultation hours also continues to look in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power from the ri@@ ms of the field . &quot;
&quot; their departure ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era , after all , the doctors have practiced there for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; recalls Ur@@ sel Fiel@@ d@@ hausen . &quot;
&quot; after a long time , she sen@@ sed a little melanch@@ oly . &quot;
&quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will surely see many patients many times , &quot; says the intern@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; her husband adds , laugh@@ ing : &quot; we have a 6,000 @-@ square @-@ meter plot . &quot;
&quot; until now I have always pressed myself before gardening , now that could be different . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel . &quot;
&quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; we are leaving the refugees &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now border controls are also passed on to our southern border , &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
&quot; as before , it is clear that anyone who wishes to apply for asylum will also &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; do so . &quot;
the emphasis is on the care and safety of people .
&quot; but it is also clear that it needs clear signals , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; people must know that we do not accept limit@@ less migration flows , nor over the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia refuses
&quot; the Croatian government had previously informed that Slovenia also wanted to leave incoming refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany , and under certain circumstances establish cor@@ ri@@ dors for the refugees . &quot;
&quot; this was the case , however , that the interior minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar did not see in Lai@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; the idea of corri@@ dors is &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; the border with Croatia , on the other hand , is already highly controlled as the outer border of the Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; as the Minister stressed , Slovenia does not want to seal its borders for refugees . &quot;
&quot; every EU member must fulfill its obligations , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; as the Croatian government reported , the first refugees in the night hours had already tried to arrive in eastern Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to avoid registration . &quot;
the Croatian police could pick them up in the nearby corn fields .
&quot; according to local media , police vehicles with new refugees since then arrived in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik . &quot;
&quot; most of them are Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children . &quot;
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; in the coming days , his country comp@@ lies with about 4000 refugees , &quot; said Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border that had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border , were re@@ directed towards Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; however , the Belgrade Government denied that it was necessary for people to adopt certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor do we do this , &quot; said it . &quot;
&quot; according to media reports , a first bus had arrived in the Serbian border town S@@ id in the morning , in the course of the day further buses were expected . &quot;
&quot; Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
the occup@@ ants were travelling all night away from the approximately 500 kilometres away ma@@ z@@ ed@@ onian border through Serbia .
&quot; we heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel further to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
&quot; thus , in actual fact , the postpon@@ ement of the previous Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary could now come to a slightly further west . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot;
Croatia &apos;s interior minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible export situations in the event of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; he did not mention the details , but he pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; . &quot; &quot;
you carry out rigorous checks to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently testified to the country as far as the standard of border controls is concerned . &quot;
&quot; on the Serbian side , about 300 refugees are still stuck behind the Hungarian border fence . &quot;
&quot; according to the media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed . &quot;
whether the remaining refugees now want to go on to the Croatian border is still unclear .
the Serbian interior minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to appe@@ ase Wednesday early on a local eye in Hor@@ gos . he kept the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed for premature .
it would not currently be a very high number of refugees .
&quot; they could not yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
volunteers advise immigrants to - hazardous - alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to distribute maps on which alternative routes are drawn through Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are even 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still un@@ cleared mines . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region . &quot;
stock exchanges : Ukra@@ inians will pay 30 million dollars
&quot; Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok should have listened to a ring of cy@@ ber criminals , accused of having gained insight into still un@@ published financial statements and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ wired and PR News@@ wire . &quot;
&quot; with the captured information , insi@@ der trading on the financial markets should have been made . &quot;
&quot; in this way , a total of more than 100 million dollars were launched by the investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders will ultimately be caught , &quot; &quot; said the SE@@ C communication . &quot;
the trials against 32 other defend@@ ants in the event continued .
most of the accused are from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetr@@ ators should have acted out both in the United States and Eastern Europe .
ec@@ umen@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ zer Mannheim has existed for 20 years
&quot; around the Mannheim Par@@ ade@@ platz , there is a lively operation . &quot;
&quot; people complete their err@@ ands , partly quick steps , partly comfortably bum@@ bling . &quot;
they control the two stations of the Mannheim car salon at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
keep track of the city .
&quot; puls@@ ating , jumping life with stunning autumn sunshine and in the middle of it four large tables each with the heading &quot; Before I die I want to die .... &quot; &quot;
&quot; with this action , the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ zer drew attention to its 20th anniversary and is quite confronted with mixed reactions . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among people , &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot;
the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ zer is available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as questions and discussions as the volunteer workers .
&quot; while some pedestri@@ ans spontaneously acc@@ esses the chal@@ k and &quot; &quot; affir@@ m my life &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; stop war &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; stop war &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; do not suffer long &quot; , &quot; others remain short , read , say sentences like &quot; &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; &quot; and then go on . &quot;
&quot; again and again , small discussions develop on the edge of the action itself , about life , dealing with death . &quot;
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; only when I realize that for me eventually comes the end of this world , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ on@@ ical Plant Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ onal Hospital for the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ zer . &quot;
&quot; therefore , this public @-@ effective action to the 20 @-@ year @-@ old is good . &quot;
&quot; however , not everyone wants to publicly disclose themselves to the tablets , it is understandable , after all , it is a very personal matter . &quot;
&quot; the issue of death and dying still remains tab@@ oos , such as Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer &apos;s experience , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has helped to open up people . &quot;

&quot; through personal experience with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in eu@@ than@@ asia . &quot;
&quot; when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ zer was seeking volunteers by calling , she immediately reported and was present at the foundation in 1995 . &quot;
&quot; Goethe belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and depend@@ ant in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and hos@@ pi@@ ce St. Vincent . &quot;
they are all carefully trained .
An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ rost works well with her job and the experiences and experiences made here .
&quot; I see life from a different point of view , consider it precious and appreciate the moment , &quot; she says . &quot;
the offer of the ambul@@ ant ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free of charge and non @-@ con@@ fession@@ al .
the financial support of health insur@@ ances and donations from relatives and associations enables training as well as training and supervision of dying and mour@@ ning companions .
training for new employees is offered every two years .
&quot; the panels on Saturday are now exhibited in the house of the Evangel@@ ical Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the house of the Catholic Church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) . &quot;
&quot; even there , further personal wishes can be recorded on post@@ cards . &quot;
F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ result bl@@ ended financial outlook for 2016 reduced
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter and the Gi@@ ant Gig@@ ant lowered his outlook for a whole year due to weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his body transport service .
&quot; the company also said that she plans to hire some 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holiday . &quot;
&quot; at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season . &quot;
the share fell over 2.5 percent in the Pre@@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. An@@ no@@ un@@ ces to Ear@@ n Bet@@ ween 10,@@ 40 $ and 10,@@ 90 $ in fiscal year ending in May , 20 cent less than the previous forecast . &quot;
analysts predicted a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10.@@ 84 $ .
&quot; despite the price increases , the lower view comes in spite of the price increases , which amount to 4.@@ 9 per cent and will be effective on January 4 , despite higher tari@@ ffs for heavy and large packages , which will be lifted from November . &quot;
&quot; the company said it was nonetheless expected that the result will be increased compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenue and growth in online trading . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company has &quot; &quot; solid earnings &quot; &quot; considering the weaker as expected economic conditions , above all in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; plans for vac@@ ations were announced one day later than that of the rival U@@ PS who plans to hire 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , such as the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter that ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; earnings per share stood at $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just short of the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , which predicted twelve analysts at Z@@ ack Investment Research . &quot;
sales rose by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion $ .
&quot; six analysts at Z@@ ack expected $ 12,@@ 23 billion . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has reported a decline in international priority shipping , which brought sales in its unit express shipment to stagn@@ ation . &quot;
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex ground .
&quot; in the last quarter , net income increased 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
&quot; the Express unit recorded higher earnings due to higher prices , while the result declined due to higher operating costs in the freight business . &quot;
&quot; in Pre@@ market trading , about an hour before the opening , F@@ ed@@ Ex shares declined by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0.@@ 15 $ . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , they concluded with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent under a record high on June 11 . &quot;
&quot; at their most expected conference in the year , Federal Reserve strate@@ gi@@ sts spend two days sitting this week around a 27 foot Honduras ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it &apos;s time to raise the car for the first time for nearly a decade . &quot;
&quot; lo@@ oming over them at one end of the dedicated , two @-@ story session hall is located a mur@@ al of the United States . &quot;
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed President Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues want to put the economic interests of the nation against all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ fold mission from Congress : maxim@@ ising US employment and prices here keep stable .
&quot; but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have recognised that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
&quot; and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict them . on Thursday , it will be announced whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from unprecedented financial interest rate since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most of the data in the economy show that it grows solid , the recent turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets could frigh@@ ten the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives to strengthen this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal loans - and be it only a quarter percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation will primarily be the most important thing to observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which sec@@ ures itself to the financial market itself . &quot;
&quot; about half of the econom@@ ists , recently inter@@ viewed by Blo@@ om@@ berg , predicted an increase of interest this week . &quot;
&quot; the financial markets , however , expect a wait from the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that indicates only a 30 % chance of an increase . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed raises the sentence , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts allevi@@ ate the impact by promising that a further increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial average was 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points , or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the set this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief Econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she does , she would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot;
other experts argued that a raise of interest would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act .
&quot; one month ago , the F@@ ed appeared in good ways to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow sharpen@@ ing of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , more economic progress would be required , an increase in the rate anticipated . &quot;
&quot; although job creation slow@@ ed in August , improving on the labour market this year was solid . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for over seven years and close to the level seen by the F@@ ed as full employment . &quot;
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; although inflation went steadily under the annual target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary impact of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the strain on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Mac@@ ro@@ economics . &quot;
but the financial markets around the world gathered together at the end of the month after China had vali@@ dated its currency .
&quot; the Dow Jones Industrial average value fell by more than 16 % in May , when investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would cur@@ b global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market has recovered somewhat this month , whereby the Dow is now almost 10 % below the top of May . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , market tur@@ mo@@ il affects complex calculation , when to increase interest rates . &quot;
&quot; if events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the past few weeks , they would have tigh@@ tened the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US central bank . &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to get a better grip on the effects .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what impact on the U.S. economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the global economy is not one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be included in the decision @-@ making process . &quot;
but in the end the F@@ ed currency authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
&quot; the mere hint of the former leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; close &quot; its monetary expansion , spark@@ ed confusion around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives can expect them not only to monitor developments elsewhere , but also with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the Global Strategy for asset management by En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements linked with apparently not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
&quot; Lack@@ er , a trusted member of the Federal Open Market Committee , which is campaig@@ ning for a raise raise , cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia caused the F@@ ed to cut its benchmark interest by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; in spite of limited dis@@ cer@@ ni@@ ble effects on growth in the US , &quot; said Lack@@ er . &quot;
one year later the F@@ ed representatives revers@@ ed these cuts .
&quot; the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability only during a serious crisis such as market re@@ unification in 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , a former member of the Committee on the Sav@@ ings of Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; the recent turbul@@ ence does not come near this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation in which she fears a raise of interest because markets are upset , &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t think it should rush ahead of time . &quot;

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : little help for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany this day .
preparing a warm welcome is not without the commitment of countless volunteers .
&quot; in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da , too , there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city . &quot;
they belong to Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
&quot; even with her 74 runs , she still enjoys teaching . &quot;
&quot; every Thursday , she is doing it in the asylum seekers at the D@@ ill@@ inger Street . &quot;
&quot; it helps refugees from Syria , Kurdist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language . &quot;
&quot; of course , the whole of other classes is at a proper school . &quot;
Brazil &apos;s Pap@@ di@@ at@@ ric Society Rio Grande favour@@ ises nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
&quot; the Brazilian Pap@@ al Organization ( SP@@ RS ) attempts to sho@@ cking women about how important good nutrition is during breast@@ feeding time . it does this by presenting images of babies who su@@ ck breasts , which are painted with representations of un@@ healthy foods . &quot;
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , recent research suggests that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adaptation that mothers should do . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , professor at the Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system . &quot;
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Spor@@ thalle
the municipal council Bern@@ ried authorized the building application for the 2.3 million euros of expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may become fl@@ atter for solar installation .
&quot; the planning for the long @-@ awaited turn@@ around at the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sports Complex is progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent joint council session , the completed construction application was unanim@@ ously approved without major discussions . &quot;
&quot; prior to that , the Board had decided among other things to apply for a civil @-@ legal &quot; exception &quot; or &quot; liberation &quot; from the current plan of development . &quot;
the &quot; exception &quot; was the permission for a special form regarding the roof construction .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ central first and roof over@@ hang &quot; &quot; is supposed to be erected . &quot;
&quot; in the background of the planning , the intended use of the roof surface for solar systems is : &quot; this gives us a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; explained mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot;
&quot; in the case of &quot; liberation , &quot; it was in turn the roof tendency , which for energetic reasons - unlike in the development plan , should lie below ten degrees . &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan regarding the roof tendency does not permit &quot; exceptions &quot; - whereby Bern@@ rie@@ der &apos;s municipal council is generally more restric@@ tive in the case of fre@@ eing orders . &quot;
&quot; however , it is not a recurring project for turn@@ key construction : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the gym hall at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
&quot; at the expense , approximately 2.3 million euros are calculated . &quot;
grants are expected from school and grass@@ roots promotion .
&quot; in the next process step , the building application for the 18 x 36 meters large hall is now presented to the District Council for review . &quot;
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the Hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg is planned to be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
&quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes new medical director at Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital . &quot;
the station as well as the majority of the staff move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; this is seen by the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , the Land@@ tra@@ tin Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß confirmed . &quot;
&quot; however , a decision on this will meet the Supervisory Board and the Supervisory Board conven@@ es on Wednesday 23 September . &quot;
&quot; if plans were implemented , all of the almost 50 employees would be employed at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg . &quot;
the overwhelming majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the existing In@@ ner Station .
the rooms are available .
&quot; employees , who cannot go to Sch@@ ong@@ au , should be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
the employees are informed of the plans .
&quot; the change is triggered by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been a medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of the year and is now transferred to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play with the question , who agreed to take the lead from October 1 , and to change his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this means &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; and broad@@ ening of the offer in the area &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; , &quot; said J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases on the inside .
&quot; for the next two years , f@@ isher with his team is said to work with his team if the Supervisory Board agrees to lead both houses , until next year , the former hospital of Kn@@ appe , which has more than 35 beds , is to be shut down in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years . &quot;
&quot; until now , the administrative district had planned this for 2018 if the current refurb@@ ishment at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital was completed . &quot;
&quot; Land@@ tra@@ tin J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss , who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , met rum@@ ors that the house , which is owned by the Federal Council , will in future be used as accommodation for asylum @-@ moving persons . &quot;
&quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say that there are several considerations . &quot;
&quot; at present , there is a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a daily sy@@ chiat@@ ry . &quot;
&quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; says Fischer about the reloc@@ ation to Le@@ ch , who was &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; by the employees . &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house where f@@ isher has been working as Chief physician for over 30 years , has not given it . &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
&quot; the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has always been threatened by closure in recent decades , departments have been closed , for example surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics . &quot;
the Hand@@ bags of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar Leu@@ ven are called for the Berg@@ ischer HC tonight ( 8.@@ 15 PM ) .
&quot; the table leader of the Bundes@@ liga is in Wuppertal the clear favourite , but there is no reason for arrogan@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; in the past season , the Bad@@ ener at the Bh@@ c took a painful defeat and got something good there . &quot;
Jag@@ ann@@ onian with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during their maize harvest on Tuesday afternoon by shots .
&quot; during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( Land@@ kreis Witt@@ enberg ) , several hunters were in use as the police told them . &quot;
&quot; after a shot of a shot , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were taken to hospitals . &quot;
&quot; at first , it was unclear how exactly this could happen to the accident . &quot;
the criminal police as@@ cer@@ tained .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a crime suspect has led the police to the corp@@ se of 16 @-@ year @-@ olds from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate who have been missing since Saturday .
&quot; in the inter@@ rog@@ ation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the young people were killed and their bodies thrown into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
&quot; a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , missing since Saturday , has fallen victim to violent crimes . &quot;
&quot; the corp@@ se of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as public prosec@@ ut@@ ors and police ha@@ st@@ ened on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , also taken by the Tuesday evening , is also indic@@ ative of the fact that the investig@@ ators were admitted to the place of discovery of the corp@@ se . &quot;
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after having come home on the eve after a visit of an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen as agreed .
&quot; in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators first met personal bel@@ ong@@ ings of the victim . &quot;
&quot; in the case of surveys in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the missing persons , there was finally a suspicion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
the alleged perpetr@@ ator led the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the body was found .
&quot; according to the authorities , the det@@ on@@ ator told the authorities that the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was killed and the corp@@ se was put into the canal . &quot;
&quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be brought forward on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put a dead stop to him . &quot;
the investigation of the immediate circumstances of the act should bring further investigations .
refugees need accommodation : study warns against housing disasters
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are seeking an affordable stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing construction is facing a challenge .
distribution rights on the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; with the incoming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities . &quot;
they compete with low income citizens around the last affordable housing .
&quot; in order to cover the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built every year by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; this is the result of a study commissioned by the &quot; &quot; Social @-@ Building &quot; &quot; Association . &quot;
&quot; by comparison : in Germany , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are finished in Germany . &quot;
&quot; with this , 140@@ ,000 dwell@@ ings are missing . &quot;
&quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as an asylum seek@@ er in a first @-@ time accommodation . &quot;
many people then stum@@ ble onto the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
&quot; according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , in the last year , however , less than half of all asylum seekers settled for rent . &quot;
&quot; however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising number of refugees . &quot;
the study also highlights significant short@@ com@@ ings in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany is shooting a residential deficit that gets bigger from year to year .
&quot; currently , some 77@@ ,000 residential units have already been missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , compla@@ ining Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot;
many professionals therefore lived in large cities in need of need in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults remained un@@ intentionally longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; because of the flu@@ ff on the housing market .
&quot; in the big cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita has fallen for the first time in recent years . &quot;
&quot; in order to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; &quot; Social H@@ ousing Construction &quot; &quot; proposes a new start . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , new incentives should revi@@ ve social housing construction . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the tax exemp@@ tion tax could be wai@@ ved and the basic tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats may be suspended . &quot;
&quot; in addition , attractive tax depreci@@ ation options are necessary according to the alliance . &quot;
the subsi@@ dy programme for refugee shel@@ ters of the Kf@@ W state bank is already well received by towns and municipalities .
&quot; a good week after the start , more than half of the available some 300 million euros were collected on Monday evening with 18@@ 4 million euros . &quot;
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free validity : Croatia and Slovenia judge Cor@@ ri@@ dor
&quot; after Hungary there is practically no passing through , as more and more refugees are choosing the way over Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb announces to grant the transit across Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
&quot; however , the route is dangerous . &quot;
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; I spoke to the Sloven@@ ian interior minister and if necessary , we will organise a corridor , &quot; &quot; said Croatian Minister of Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
&quot; after the deportation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees have been broken down to Croatia to get to Western Europe from there . &quot;
&quot; 500 people have come across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reported by the Croatian TV station RT@@ L . &quot;
Hungary had sealed its border for refugees on the previous day .
&quot; new laws , which came into force on the same day , are also practically unnecessary for proper asylum procedures in Hungary . &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic explained , &quot; You can travel through and we prepare for this eventu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;
&quot; however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , the Croatian police picked up the first refugees at the border of Serbia to the EU neighbouring country . &quot;
&quot; most of the media reported from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they came both by bus and taxis to the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
&quot; immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia . &quot;
&quot; at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not encounter a fence . &quot;
&quot; for this , the border strip contains other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 90@@ s . &quot;
mine clear@@ ers are now to quickly create a safe passage .
&quot; after Hungary , however , hardly any more refugees arrive after the closure of the border . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , 3@@ 66 people attacked the police . &quot;
&quot; shortly before the final decision on Monday , it was still 9@@ 380 . &quot;
the new Hungarian laws under@@ cover the overcoming and damage to the border fence as a crime .
35 criminal proceedings were therefore initiated in the border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed in the south @-@ Hungary border .
the defend@@ ants are threatened with sentences of up to five years and deportation from the country .
&quot; according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the &quot; &quot; transit zones &quot; , &quot; of which almost all - 93 - the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; among the applicants , 13 families with small children and two elderly . &quot;
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees detained .
&quot; practically , no one has a prospect of granting asylum in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; safe third country . &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers should be de@@ ported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
workers began to fail in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they collected the tr@@ ash that tens of thousands of people had left at the road@@ side over the past few weeks .
barrier gri@@ l@@ les were disman@@ tled and one of the recording @-@ camps in the bor@@ der@@ line was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express itself to the purpose of this reconstruction .
&quot; after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria is reaching only a few refugees . &quot;
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
&quot; however , about 20,000 migrants were still in the country after government statements . &quot;
&quot; in Salzburg , around 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany . &quot;
the train from there to Germany was stopped in the morning by instruction German authorities .
&quot; in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees regularly met on foot . &quot;
mayor drove &quot; str@@ anded &quot; over the border
&quot; after the bridge festival on Sunday we were occupied with the clearing , when suddenly ten people with travel agents stood at the entrance of the tent , &quot; says W@@ ern@@ stein Mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot;
tourists who wanted to travel by train to Passa@@ u .
&quot; but because Germany had surprisingly closed the rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the flow of refugees , Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and drove the stu@@ ds together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars over the border into the Nah@@ e Passa@@ u . &quot;
&quot; previously , we had the un@@ hoped @-@ hoped @-@ guests only once again , with snack and drinks . &quot;
we have said the same that we bring them by car to Passa@@ u .
&quot; that was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man could not take a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; that made us very happy , &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; the str@@ anded ten@@ sile passages were switched from a ICE in a regional train to Passa@@ u on Sunday evening , in order to find it after the short notice that the railway traffic to Germany was stopped , but still to try over the border . &quot;
&quot; however , the regional train was removed from the border in W@@ ern@@ stein at the Inn . &quot;
&quot; in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high in the course . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday , the Brück@@ en@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday was soci@@ able - organized by the union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
now Viktor Or@@ b@@ án sends out further thousands of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy :
&quot; instead of helping R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke at the establishment of structures that ensure human@@ eness , our Federal Chancellor publicly and publicly stri@@ cken the attitude of the Hungarian government into the ha@@ ze circle of National Socialism . &quot;
&quot; the leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans , who are now confronted with cha@@ otic conditions in the border areas . &quot;
&quot; also the refugees will have to realize that the &quot; &quot; promised land &quot; &quot; that they have invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will be a great challenge , in view of the ongoing refugee streams and the winter &apos;s approaching winter , to create decent conditions for protection @-@ seekers . &quot;
&quot; and there will be an even greater peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
&quot; Konrad in search of 35@@ ,000 winter@@ proof lod@@ gings &quot;
Konrad has all hands full to do with refugee interrup@@ tions .
Christian Konrad is used to his word weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank to set up districts for the thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first recording centre Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got a grip on Konrad .
&quot; we have no homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported of his first success . &quot;
&quot; also the lodging of the 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday was without great confusion , said Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; master@@ work . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Interior Ministry , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in total , Konrad expects a demand of 85@@ ,000 lod@@ gings in the he@@ ur@@ ly year . &quot;
&quot; in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 dwell@@ ings have to be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 are expected to provide the federal states 15,000 of the Con@@ federation . &quot;
&quot; should there be more refugees , we can do it . &quot;
&quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; Konrad said . &quot;
he has already held talks with the provincial govern@@ ors .
they would have assured him of creating lod@@ gings for the coming refugees .
&quot; it &apos;s going well in Upper Austria , &quot; Fer@@ ry Mai@@ er said . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
&quot; tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , which will be clari@@ fied as to how the Church will help . &quot;
&quot; the asylum coordinator puts great expectations into the ORF action &quot; &quot; Hel@@ fen like us &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the platform , private persons can easily offer accommodation . &quot;
&quot; in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty in winter . &quot;
&quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; &quot; very high &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in times of emergency , it could not be that land@@ lords have to respect a certain height of the towel holder or the size of the sky@@ lights . &quot;
&quot; for a temporary period , &quot; emergency standards &quot; would have to apply . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to the Interior Ministry he is more successful in accommodation , Konrad establishes with his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am an elderly gentle@@ man , whom one does not say without further in the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
&quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er don &apos;t cause the Republic any costs , as they declared themselves . &quot;
they want to increase their head@@ count to three to four .
&quot; up to now , their own mapping has not been successful yet . &quot;
Konrad wanted to place a container on the Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are apparently problems with the permission .
Linz calls for a better division
&quot; for the time being , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings like tips @-@ arena and design center to accommodate refugees is planning the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; this is not necessary at the moment , since the persons concerned can currently be subsidi@@ zed without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , other locations should be tested for their suitability . &quot;
the governor &apos;s criticism of the division of refugees within the federal state is critici@@ zed by the city chief .
other districts also have to make their contribution here .
&quot; Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; &quot; boundaries are not sealed &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann , Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) , on Monday cor@@ related further action in the refugee issue . &quot;
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders were not sealed off .
the continuation of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany remains possible .
&quot; however , there is now the appropriate border controls . &quot;
&quot; for the time being , special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; however , those seeking protection would be brought to Germany with regular trains . &quot;
&quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for increased solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot;
&quot; for P@@ ühr@@ inger , that Austria is now introducing controls to its limits , it is &quot; a logical consequence &quot; from the action of the Germans . &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
the general restoration of the &quot; New Wer@@ ft &quot; in the Linz industrial line has been officially completed .
&quot; in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the publicly traded IT Group has moved into S &amp; T , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector . &quot;
&quot; in IT the clever bra@@ ins are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
&quot; he could imagine investing in the start @-@ up companies of the new ship@@ yard , and later also to acquire them . &quot;
&quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to co @-@ operate with the new neighbours - wher@@ eu@@ pon the haus@@ er promises something : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; € 1.7 million have been invested by S &amp; T in the site , 3.3 million euros from Tech@@ Center , which belongs to a third of the city of Linz , the state of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is le@@ ased by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
&quot; 30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square metres of remaining space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second shop in the arcade
Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are the focus of the new shop .
&quot; actually , Jutta Br@@ eit wanted to get a dog . &quot;
&quot; this project had to shift the 49 @-@ year @-@ old propriet@@ or of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ aden : after all , she now grew up in the form of another business location . &quot;
&quot; in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop opposite the business in which they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothes from various manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are from 75 euros . &quot;
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euro .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously it was rebuilt several weeks .
&quot; but I have long considered if I &apos;m going to open a shop , &quot; Br@@ eit says . &quot;
&quot; among other things , the decision was that the Fur@@ la producers who are at home in Bologna from the idea of their own site where only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the only ones in the metrop@@ olitan area of Linz , who sell this stamp , &quot; says the mother of two daughters , who himself has Italian roots . &quot;
her fashion interest has delivered her mother to the cra@@ dle .
&quot; most of the time , when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices . &quot;
&quot; why so many women , when looking at a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture , can also not answer the professional woman with the last certainty . &quot;
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag re@@ stores each outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the for@@ e@@ wers of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place whose residents are called An@@ ders .
this feature links some also with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become the US president .
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for the upright .
whether it mani@@ fests itself hostile to foreign journalists or reveals information gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US pres@@ idency inspir@@ es the election campaign vigor@@ ously .
and cuts off well with it .
this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from .
&quot; the New Yorker with the &quot; &quot; F@@ öhn@@ fr@@ is@@ ur &quot; &quot; is a term for many in the wine village on the wine road . &quot;
some in the 1200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant place is related to him about -@@ zig corners .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in election campaign mode . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Sim@@ one Wen@@ del turned a film about Tru@@ mp .
and what do the villa@@ gers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find it exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ enberg style , &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ t filmed an am@@ using documentary about the town and its famous shoots , to which alongside Tru@@ mp also counts the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , also comes to word in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
he did not bring it to the king of his heart .
&quot; although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also the opinion that Tru@@ mp is a bit a big mouth , &quot; Wen@@ del says . &quot;
&quot; coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the per@@ imeter , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - too high @-@ German : the gi@@ ver , she says . &quot;
&quot; so , Tru@@ mp is coming from the village of the gi@@ ver . &quot;
the success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
the corner@@ stone of the real estate group was the first real estate sales in New York .
&quot; but the life of grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland , failed in the Bavarian state , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged then . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tru@@ mp , because he once was cut off without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , declared the start of the film . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; illegal immig@@ rant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes marked statements of the night .
he had repeatedly spoken out about Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a boundary wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; as he pol@@ ed , this is not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative of Tru@@ mp@@ s ( &quot; The grand@@ ma was a born Tru@@ mp , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the win@@ em@@ aker in retirement looks more distant to the Americans , &quot; he &apos;s always so br@@ isk . &quot;
does he believe that Tru@@ mp is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt .
&quot; the pension host Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ramm mentioned like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit , which was generally well anchored . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; it would be better if he did not win the election , for &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been like him , &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; my President is not , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; and : &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe also without the president Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Wend@@ els &apos;s film , for which Tru@@ mp has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12@@ ,000 film @-@ singers , even in the US the interest is awak@@ ened . &quot;
the Upper Bavarian town of Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first mountain climbing village .
&quot; from the hand of the vice @-@ president of the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 inhabitants of the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den national park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in Austria , there are already 20 &quot; mountain climbing villages . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in neighbouring countries , the Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award . &quot;
a &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants .
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
&quot; seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise dominates the reviews , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership during the Today Show &quot;
&quot; Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son rush to Can@@ ber@@ ra in order to report to the loss of the leadership of the liber@@ als , but there have been no major shifts in the Reviews for Today . &quot;
N@@ ine &apos;s breakfast show was broad@@ cast@@ ed by the federal capital when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull made the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
&quot; the rival Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ anth@@ a Ar@@ my@@ tage , was in London as part of a one @-@ week series of international television programs including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n . &quot;
&quot; this down@@ side of the resistance seemed to play no part for Australian TV spectators , as Sun@@ rise achieved average 39@@ 7.@@ 000 spectators at the five capitals , compared to today 33@@ 9.@@ 000 . &quot;
&quot; today , a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; today , in recent months Today , the gap to Sun@@ rise has closed . &quot;
&quot; in August today , Today reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 3@@ 30,000 of Sun@@ rise . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the distance between 40,000 and 50,000 passed . &quot;
&quot; so far in September , Sun@@ rise stands at an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 viewers at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 at Today . &quot;
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning people more than the Parliament !
&quot; Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for the review ! &quot;

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former Seri@@ enst@@ ar von Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama about a recent weather@@ ed father , who decides to settle down with his two children on New Zealand &apos;s coast , reached a very impressive figure of 1.@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers . &quot;
critics asked if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ter Star Rebe@@ cca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; yes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million spectators and struck slightly The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL &apos;s Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ 000 ) . &quot;
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 p.m. to 5.@@ 30 p.m. ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe gave an average of 44@@ 6,000 spectators . &quot;
&quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jumped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small win over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; on Monday evening the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia achieved 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour was 7@@ 20,000 . &quot;
&quot; hot @-@ seed average of 6@@ 20,000 . &quot;
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that Hot @-@ Se@@ at will finally prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars which failed to over@@ leaf the Mc@@ Gu@@ ire Show .

the last three agree : Bachelor &apos;s Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
&quot; L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki have probably unknow@@ ingly revealed who wins the Bachelor . &quot;
&quot; the woman , at which Sam Wood finally lands in The Bachelor , was wrapped in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
&quot; but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before coming out of three , you might acci@@ dentally have given a clu@@ e who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood keeps his lips tight until the final on Thursday
&quot; all three women have been ly@@ rical about why Wood is the perfect man and they called his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , when the question is asked &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods Last Rose ? , &quot; their answers could become a game destro@@ yer who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors . &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both fast - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the very first day .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and ( Sarah &apos;s ) and S@@ ams energies noticed , I felt that they were quite compatible , and I thought it was in the whole course of the show , &quot; Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows said . &quot;
&quot; Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet , it is so much fun to be with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added . &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple .
&quot; from their point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that last week &apos;s visit to the house made it clear that Wood was &quot; the One . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I &apos;m now un@@ condition@@ ally adjusted to him , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked whom Wood should choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zz@@ led . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
&quot; the Bachelor is broad@@ cast@@ ed on Wednesday , 19 : 30 , on Ten . &quot;

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank as he lost a fight like the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League conver@@ sions at his first Pun@@ t return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 win against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a pun@@ t return and also to the ongoing game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team he encouraged them .
Tom@@ sul@@ a confirmed Hay@@ ne publicly during his press conference after the game .
&quot; the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ mor Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his missed catch and take care of the next game . &quot;
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a Pun@@ t restored in the first quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian cor@@ oll@@ ary had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
&quot; Hay@@ ne ha@@ st@@ ened the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy to 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he could not imagine a worse start into his N@@ FL career , &quot;
&quot; that was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; Hay@@ ne said . &quot;
&quot; Hay@@ ne compared the car@@ ver with his Orig@@ in debut in 2007 , when a pass at his own in @-@ Go@@ al region led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land . &quot;
&quot; overall , it was nevertheless a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;

the Free voters are demanding the hi@@ ring of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees .
&quot; at the beginning of the F@@ W Aut@@ umn Conference in Greater Wall@@ stadt , members of the party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned of a severe crisis in Bavaria schools when there are no correspon@@ dingly new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1,000 additional teachers to save the schools from collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , we will get distor@@ tions in the Bavarian education system . &quot;
the Free voters &quot; Parliament session conven@@ es until Friday in the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ian municipality .
&quot; in fact , quite different main topics were planned . &quot;
but the record number of refugees now dominates the Free voters &quot; meeting .
&quot; of course , the topic of asylum will over@@ lay the clo@@ ister , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , as existed during the Yugosla@@ v wars in the 1990s . &quot;
&quot; so it &apos;s not going on , we must go to the causes , &quot; said the Free Syrian leader . &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to de@@ fer the Free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; this is why Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more staff for administrative courts responsible for asylum applications : &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seekers , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several federal states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; we needed uniform standards of federal states nationwide . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bavaria pus@@ hes away , others not . &quot;
&quot; we need to become more powerful . &quot;
&quot; however , the national policy in the big wall city should not fall under the table . &quot;
a long lasting bur@@ ners remain on the agenda : the education policy .
&quot; for the new school year , Minister of Culture Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot study &quot; Mittel@@ stufe plus &quot; with an extension of the secondary school in three to four years . &quot;
but Ai@@ wan@@ ger is not far enough .
&quot; the issue of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot;
we call for freedom of choice for all the gymn@@ asi@@ ums wishing to do so .
&quot; free travel at the G@@ 9 anywhere , where it is requested . &quot;
tigh@@ ten Wall Street helps D@@ ax jump on le@@ aps
&quot; the German stock market has closed , after a long @-@ distance , trend @-@ free and nervous trade route with wins . &quot;
&quot; only in the afternoon , a stronger kick @-@ off of the US stock exchanges ensured a clear direction , which ultimately promoted D@@ ax by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8,@@ 13 points upward . &quot;
the M@@ DA@@ X medium @-@ sized values gained from 0.@@ 54 percent to 19 55@@ 2,@@ 88 points . &quot;
the technology @-@ based Tec@@ D@@ ax rose by 1.@@ 03 percent to 17@@ 3@@ 6.@@ 69 points .
the Euro@@ Sto@@ xx 50 as the euro zone index of the euro fell by 1.@@ 01 percent to 3@@ 20@@ 7.@@ 60 points .
solid profits also booked commercial venues in London and Paris .
&quot; in the United States , the Dow Jones index most recently noted about 1 percent in the plus . &quot;
many of the stock exchanges reck@@ on that the markets will be in place until after the interest in the US and for the big decline on the fut@@ ures trading on this Friday .
&quot; in the meantime , RW@@ E &apos;s shares have pushed the debate on the loads from the nuclear phase to a record low and left deep in E@@ on . &quot;
&quot; according to &quot; Spiegel , &quot; the German energy companies possibly lack 30 billion euros of provisions . &quot;
the German government denied the figures mentioned in the press .
&quot; as a result , the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered somewhat , but ultimately lost 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) . &quot;
&quot; at the D@@ ax summit , Infin@@ eon shares increased by another 3.@@ 22 percent . &quot;
&quot; according to a tra@@ der , a positive report from the US investor magazine &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; appeared from the weekend . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , investors now pay too little attention to the German chip@@ maker . &quot;
investment in promising w@@ afer technologies and focus on the car market should pay off .
&quot; car values were in demand : even in the traditionally weak summer month of August , more cars were sold again than in the year @-@ earlier period , as the industry association AC@@ EA announced at the start of the International Motor Show IAA in Frankfurt . &quot;
car papers from Daimler and BMW increased by 1.@@ 34 percent and 2.@@ 21 percent respectively .
Volkswagen benefits have been reduced by 1.@@ 26 percent .
on the German pension market the return on stock of listed federal securities amounted to 0.@@ 48 ( Friday : 0.@@ 50 ) percent .
the Rev@@ x index rose by 0.@@ 12 percent to 13@@ 9.@@ 55 points .
the federal Future lost 0.@@ 71 percent to 15@@ 4.@@ 11 points .
the course of the euro sun@@ k in the afternoon to 1.@@ 12@@ 62 dollars .
&quot; at noon the European Central Bank set the reference rate to USD 1,@@ 13@@ 05 ( 1,@@ 12@@ 68 ) . &quot;
the dollar therefore cost $ 0.@@ 88@@ 46 ( 0.@@ 88@@ 75 ) Euro .
4 People killed after police officers shooting rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot elas@@ tics in a crowd who demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district Rup@@ an@@ deh@@ i , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , executive officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside of a police station , with some of them throwing stones and fire@@ bombs . &quot;
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police had used tear gas and then shot in the air before she resor@@ ted to rubber bul@@ lets .
&quot; twenty police officers and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the used rubber bul@@ lets , which are known to kill , but which are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal on southern levels , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ hes@@ ites say that new provinces , which are formed under the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence . &quot;
there were protests in Western Nepal by the ethnic group of the T@@ arus that want their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent confron@@ tations since the 10th century . &quot;
&quot; killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which has been centrally governed for centuries . &quot;
&quot; the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legislature ha@@ st@@ ened the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; the legislature voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the constitutional bill in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday . &quot;
construction site planned in the city
the property at Em@@ den Youth Centre Old Mail is to be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square metre area .
&quot; a mixture of trade , commerce and housing is planned - but there are no specific offers yet . &quot;
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market an approximately 4000 sq@@ .@@ m. plot in direct proximity to the youth centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are underway .
&quot; the plan is to use the terrain for a mixture of trade , commerce and housing . &quot;
&quot; wait for appropriate offers , called it by the city . &quot;
which investor should come into question is not yet clear .
&quot; accordingly , no contracts were concluded . &quot;
&quot; the city of Em@@ den had bought a part of the property , which is located on the Ring@@ straße / corner of the Great Road , already several months ago and let the buildings be torn off . &quot;
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the planning for the holiday res@@ ett@@ lement at the Little Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor made public plans for the project for the first time .
many An@@ li@@ eger are still worried - they fear the exp@@ elling of their leisure tre@@ k
&quot; months had been negotiated behind closed doors , tri@@ mmed , deb@@ ated and drawn . &quot;
now there are plans for a new holiday home village near Em@@ den on the table .
&quot; the prospective , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ my company &quot; System Construction , &quot; announced his plans for the first time in the Urban Development Committee of the Em@@ den Council on Monday evening . &quot;
originally this point had stood on the non @-@ public part of the order of the day .
&quot; under pressure from the project critics and the F@@ DP Group , accused of investors and administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends retired from system construction management to the offensive : &quot; we have not yet responded to all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors . &quot;
but it is good to meet all the ru@@ mo@@ urs now .
the roughly ten to twelve million euro project has been in discussion for months .
&quot; violent reactions among sea @-@ bu@@ d owners , who came to the meeting , highlighted the pictures and new details of the hotel building they want . &quot;
&quot; Roberto Schulz , mer@@ maid owner and board member at the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; &quot; this is a giant cl@@ ot@@ z that overlooks all other buildings . &quot;
&quot; he also fears like many other project critics that traffic would increase sharply due to the planned size of the plant : &quot; &quot; there must be whole bus charges so that this will be imp@@ uted &quot; , &quot; says Schulz &quot;
&quot; what happens exactly on the well one hect@@ are area of the former restaurant , however , is still open . &quot;
there is no operator yet .
&quot; first we have to have a coherent concept , &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ end . &quot;
&quot; because this was still missing , the development plans were still variable . &quot;
welcome children at gor@@ illas in the Frankfurt Zoo
the Frankfurt Zoo is looking forward to new generation at its gor@@ illas .

Google starts double donation campaign to collect $ 11 million for refugees
&quot; Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a double donation campaign aimed at helping thousands of refugees trying to over@@ roll the thousands of refugees , since they are fle@@ eing from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries . &quot;
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to announ@@ cing the donation call on his blog .
&quot; instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who fled from Kab@@ ul with her family , when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; our journey included many dark web and bus trips , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but as the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help . &quot;
&quot; donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
&quot; Google said that the first globally collected donations will be doubled to $ 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com , low to $ 11 million . &quot;
&quot; Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year . &quot;
&quot; many also fled from the war torn by war , Yemen , Iraq and Libya . &quot;

weight loss surgery may be helpful for obes@@ e di@@ abe@@ tics .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes may last at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to tell if easily obes@@ e people with diabetes care for weight loss surgery longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality data takes a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial about the new J@@ AM@@ A surgery study . &quot;
&quot; weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
&quot; over the years , obesity has proven to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been conducted among people who are obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain degree of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24,@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , the researchers from Taiwan &apos;s Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital used data they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity surgery - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c ul@@ cer - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight . &quot;
&quot; the average BM@@ I among those who underwent this operation decreased from 31 to 24@@ ,5 to the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the BM@@ I stayed with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatment approximately equal to 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those undergoing a surgical procedure , 36 % of the disease worsen@@ ed completely and at 28 % . &quot;
&quot; in the medi@@ cally treated group , the diabetes dissolved completely only in one percent and in some cases in only about two percent . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the results of the blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol were generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out . &quot;
&quot; the researchers also monitored the patient blood levels of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , reflecting blood sugar levels over time . &quot;
&quot; ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , the researchers write . &quot;
&quot; after the operation , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; &quot; - as reflected in the improved ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not reduce mortality in five years , so the lead researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also compared the average results for the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the gas rec@@ tomy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved greater decline in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 2.1 % ) and reported a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study does not show survival benefit from surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of heavy humans in Sweden that surgery leads to longer lives , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study it was in obes@@ e people who underwent O@@ bes@@ ity operation , about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no benefit for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was comfor@@ ting for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because she says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient with his BM@@ I is between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we are waiting too long for people to take this seriously , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have firmly attached their bodies to obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
&quot; it is a theme that is currently noted in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular and un@@ si@@ gh@@ tly at school times , meets the flock of her youth after years , and this falls in love with her . &quot;
&quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot;
&quot; beyond the love story , the novel is likely to be interesting for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages . &quot;
the main professional author grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she could place a literary monument in her hom@@ etown .
it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; Europe couldn &apos;t take up all the refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East was lying . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist guide demanded an end to violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford that dedicated himself to ethics studies .
he demanded that in the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was ad@@ am@@ ant , but the situation was not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama praised German and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; caring for several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as genuine peace and true development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the end , we have to think about how the killing is reduced in their countries . &quot;
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and also commented George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack on 11 September and found out that the violent reaction of the US pulled a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the path to resol@@ ving this problem is in non @-@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence , and that has caused unexpected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
quar@@ terly increase of intake of disinf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the last 4 years
&quot; po@@ ison@@ ous control centres in the US report about an almost 400 percent increase in children under 12 years of age , which swallow strongly alcoholic hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Centre . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Centre , cases of hand dis@@ infection were reported in children under 12 years of age , reporting poison control centres , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them lands in the emergency room , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants intentionally while some do it to impress their friends , or because of a mut@@ ation in the social media . &quot;
watch videos on YouTube show how teenagers drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants just because of a cheap experience .
young people have allegedly mixed a disinf@@ ect@@ ant with a soft mouth water to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; Lop@@ ez said . &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
&quot; there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent , which are very appealing for children . &quot;
disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
&quot; especially in infants , a few sp@@ lashes can lead to alcohol intoxic@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Th@@ orn@@ ton , medical director of the poison control centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 transmitter in Can@@ sa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t leave any si@@ p whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children and when children come to it , then it &apos;s a quick way to consume lots of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who had recently taken four sy@@ ring@@ es from the straw@@ berry of fra@@ grant disinf@@ ect@@ ant at school , was brought to an emergency room . &quot;
&quot; your blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice t@@ aller than the threshold that is legally considered by an adult , Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey said , a not@@ ary doctor who treated her at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah had her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
&quot; doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on the signs of Hir@@ n trauma , as the girl fell through the alcohol and hit his head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said . &quot;
&quot; it was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and to store the disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
&quot; beyond alcohol intoxic@@ ation , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , two women were killed in Ontario women following the swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ect@@ ants containing toxic , non @-@ declared ingredients . &quot;
&quot; health authorities suspect that the product contains meth@@ anol , a deadly solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was noted as an active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students of the fourth grade in New York State planned to poison their &quot; gem@@ eine &quot; teacher by placing anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; says a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to disinf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ishes her from her room .
&quot; the police viewed the sh@@ attered plan as &quot; &quot; g@@ ossi@@ p &quot; &quot; and rejected disciplinary measures to the school authority . &quot;
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged

a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver drove on the cross@@ road towards the roundabout of industrial area and noticed too late that at the roundabout had stopped two vehicles ahead .
&quot; as a result , he crashed into the rear of an audience with his truck and pushed this vehicle to a standing Ford Fi@@ esta . &quot;
&quot; in the event of accidents , there was a damage of around 10,000 euros , shares the police with them . &quot;
the Audi 33 @-@ year @-@ old was no longer ready and had to be tow@@ ed .

&quot; I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it . &quot;
the lack of title competition in Scottish football is boring Dut@@ ch@@ man - de Bo@@ er
&quot; the former ran@@ ger mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , since there is no title rival@@ ry with the R@@ angers . &quot;
&quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; in Holland , they don &apos;t show highlights of the Celtic games anymore and why ? &quot;
it &apos;s because the ran@@ gers are not there .
people here do not just talk about the return of ran@@ gers .
you are talking about Old Firm .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
&quot; there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Firm games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games . &quot;
&quot; I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la . &quot;
&quot; Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la accepted that Celtic war has to fight , but the Norwegian chef s@@ wore to turn things around . &quot;
&quot; after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent departure from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , which now stands at the top of the table with five points ahead . &quot;
&quot; Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens . &quot;
we feel that exactly like that - but we have to go on .
&quot; we really need , really the support of Celtic , because that makes the players better . &quot;
being together is so important .

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged as it increases in the United Kingdom .
&quot; unemployment in Scotland lasted from May to July unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the UK as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1,@@ 82 million in the same period . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was above that of the U@@ K@@ s of 5.5 percent , as shown by the figures of the Bureau for National Statistics ( ON@@ S ) . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost exactly one year ago that Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; in these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot;

why I am witn@@ essing an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
&quot; a little later today , except for a late legal intervention , I shall see how a man is being put to death . &quot;
&quot; when it happens and I hope that it doesn &apos;t happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ s@@ p is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
&quot; the invitation came for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; when the day drew near , I began to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the USA , and since more applications are available as seats , there is a mac@@ ab@@ ere lot@@ tery taking place to decide who is elected . &quot;
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
those who are selected will observe it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t do that .
&quot; I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ sy &apos;s closest friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hour visit . &quot;
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so I won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pencil to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality on Twitter .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner just how he wants it and you get access .
I compla@@ ined to her .
&quot; she admitted that she &quot; could have form@@ ulate better , &quot; but she still thinks that it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot;
Richard Glos@@ s@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to be present to write there .
&quot; when he dies , he thinks that the public relations work will help against the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of pod@@ casts that I have made . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go back to all the details here .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ s@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ za would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of action .
but I believe that a strong likel@@ ihood is that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him die .
I can &apos;t claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death .
man after wet police ch@@ ase persu@@ aded to come out of the Cann@@ ing River
the Cann@@ ing V@@ ale polic@@ eman stayed dry when he talked to the man of the Cann@@ ing River .
&quot; an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang down the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , only a few meters away from a police officer trying to &quot; gently persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot; &quot;
the police of Cann@@ ing V@@ ale was sum@@ mon@@ ed to a house peace break in Ch@@ echn@@ ya on Tuesday .
&quot; when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them in the direction of Cann@@ ing River . &quot;
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in the water and said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman works . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
&quot; in 2006 , cous@@ ins drove his car into the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim across the S@@ wan River . &quot;
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspired locals to the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threat@@ ens to end race sport
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
&quot; he aimed at the ste@@ wards and the integrity section of Racing Victoria and claimed that they performed a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching by Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; M@@ oo@@ dy told Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions , when it came to the positive cob@@ alt tone test at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain . &quot;
he had held back 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ onage alleg@@ ations and didn &apos;t want it to &quot; look like too high @-@ hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it and I &apos;ve been sitting on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out once , &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot;
they know it was going on .
&quot; sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said . &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I want to walk up@@ lifted , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them . &quot;
&quot; if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I shouldn &apos;t be a trainer anymore . &quot;
I have to think about what I do with my license .
&quot; previously , M@@ oo@@ dy had let the bomb blast in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com that the integrity department had tried to spy out his stable . &quot;
&quot; eigh@@ teen months ago Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I am going to name when I &apos;m asked - and offered him an occupation in my st@@ ables to deliver information about what I &apos;m doing inside my st@@ ables , &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on Rac@@ ing@@ .com . &quot;
they seem to believe that I am a sc@@ amm@@ ar .
&quot; if that is the case , they should certainly believe in their n@@ oses , because they failed in trying to touch me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard K@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today . &quot;
should I think that it will be personal ?
did the R@@ V@@ L behave cow@@ ard@@ ly and perhaps makes people outside of coaches responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
&quot; perhaps they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say will let them think about it now . &quot;
&quot; but I am now at the point where that doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad . &quot;
that makes me really sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the training levels of the trainer were based on the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led to the fact that he could &quot; &quot; throw his license over the table &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ beaten Master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race tags &quot; &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse &apos;s deb@@ its , which viol@@ ated the rules . &quot;
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my employees carried mud on the leg er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously .
it could have been like last night .
it would have been like yesterday the whole day as it was .
but it was also the same on the race day .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the package on the race day . an investigation of this matter has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot;
man arrested after driver flight
the police arrested a man on the weekend following a clas@@ h with a cycl@@ ist and driver flight in Cob@@ ram .
&quot; the cycl@@ ist was delivered to the Royal Melbourne hospital with heavy injuries , after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Mur@@ ray Valley Highway . &quot;
the police said the driver went on without stopping to help the injured driver .
&quot; on Monday , a 50 @-@ year @-@ old man from N@@ ath@@ alia offered himself to the police in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on . &quot;
he is expected to be accused of driver cur@@ ses and inadequate assistance and for other traffic violations .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy beats against ri@@ vals because of claims to ring combat
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy critic@@ ised the tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League favour@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters coach Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbitr@@ ators allowed the storm @-@ players &quot; ring fights &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in the qualifying fin@@ als in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos Trainer Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett made a scar@@ cely concealed remark about the Storm team after his team scored the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; sample &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in rings .
Bell@@ amy defended the fli@@ cker of his team and said that they were only concentrated on their &quot; contact . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team makes him confident , as it means that they were worried about being hit by the Storm team . &quot;
&quot; this shows up again and again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about ring fights when she beat us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that we have changed nothing at our defensive system or techniques throughout the year . however , in the past six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ tics a real focal point and that has provided for us the turn@@ around . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he &apos;s probably not accustomed to losing it , so it was a bit a shock for him . &quot;
&quot; it is funny , as it always appears at this time of the year . &quot;
Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wa@@ yne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; he has compared his play on Saturday night with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; Bell@@ amy said . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 , St George was critici@@ zed as a te@@ di@@ ous team , and Wa@@ yne said he &apos;ll take care of it . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players such as Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t so they can play as they play . &quot;
&quot; I build stronger confidence because they say these things , because they are a bit worried to play against us . &quot;
&quot; six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think about us when it came to the Big Games . &quot;
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the Storm vs. R@@ oo@@ sters game achieved a higher result than the match Bron@@ cos against Cow@@ boys .
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game , but is this an exciting game ? &quot;
&quot; or are breaks , and no points more exciting ? &quot;
&quot; for me , it is the maps . &quot;
&quot; when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in one phase . &quot;
&quot; the storm team released this weekend , as they won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on the next Saturday night in the pre @-@ fin@@ als at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning . &quot;
&quot; Ser@@ bi@@ ans with 200,000 $ deposit on drug charges &quot;
&quot; a man who possibly threat@@ ens a life @-@ long penalty due to his attempt to get into the possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a $ 200,000 security deposit . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay that came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and placed in Co@@ om@@ era in August . &quot;
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants in the marina during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
&quot; despite a potentially lifel@@ ong penalty for trying to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole amount and that in the cafe could have been a harmless reason . &quot;
&quot; the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was concerned about the danger of escape at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he declared to the court on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in case of a criminal complaint , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security jointly offered to achieve his release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it statements of the two persons , it is clear that the circulation of a safety of 200,000 dollars represents a real financial burden , &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ agan . &quot;
&quot; but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on deposit , under conditions that he gave his austr@@ ali@@ an and his Serbian passport , reported to the police every day , stopping at a starting point of 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;
accident at A@@ 5 near Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab apart
a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening at a rear @-@ end collision with three trucks on the motorway 5 near Karlsruhe .
two of the three involved trucks had slow@@ ed down in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
&quot; the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to move to the left at the last moment , as the police told them . &quot;
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident @-@ causing er@@ ect completely tore apart .
the driver was badly injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed for six hours until 2 o &apos;clock .
&quot; a damage was incurred in the amount of 12@@ 2,000 euros . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone of girls to enti@@ ce pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es to send images
a ped@@ ophi@@ le used the phone of a 11 year old girl to demand pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the girl &apos;s phone as she slept and logged into an online mess@@ aging service from which he received a number of un@@ decent images of children sent to him by another user .
the girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping dog .
&quot; she saw it , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately al@@ armed her mother . &quot;
&quot; the police took care of this and saw the five images , then analyzed the computer found under the address and discovered &quot; &quot; relevant &quot; &quot; web research that used terms for searching for un@@ decent images of children . &quot;
&quot; H@@ og@@ g then claimed to the officials that he did it , as it would lead to &quot; pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es on the internet &quot; and then &quot; preten@@ ded to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on said to the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; he said it would be a addiction , - that it would be hoo@@ ked to frigh@@ ten people . &quot;
&quot; he admitted that searching on the computer were carried out by him , but said it happened because he wanted to claim to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten ped@@ ophi@@ le . &quot;
after his talks he was asked with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and which he asked to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure her .
&quot; he said he was sick in his head when he drinks , and said he would see pictures of rape and murder . &quot;
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was trem@@ bling and crying .
she also saw the un@@ decent images on the phone and confronted the defend@@ ants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused computer and pla@@ yst@@ ation used to talk to girls who looked much younger than he did .
&quot; H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty in the sense of the indictment to have viol@@ ated un@@ decent images of children on 14 June last year , and did not appear before the court at a hearing on 24 March this year . &quot;
&quot; defence lawyer Gregor S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g does not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , as one could argue that &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; can be found in his crime . &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff A@@ list@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael conf@@ esses the verdict until October to get background reports on social work .
&quot; H@@ og@@ g was granted a deposit in this case , but was kept in detention for hear@@ ings on other cases pending . &quot;
he was added to the list of sexual offen@@ ders before the date of judgment .
smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers retreat to Germany on small border cross@@ ings
more and more refugees are taken up off the Grand Control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
&quot; many of the locks , from fear of discovery and arrest , increased human beings at smaller border cross@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said . &quot;
more than 1000 refugees have been taken up in the bor@@ ehol@@ es of Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn since Tuesday .
they were on foot over bridges and traffic jams to the German side .
there they are received by Federal Police officers and forwarded to the registration .
&quot; at the Munich Central Station , more refugees arrived after German police in comparison to the start of the week on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; around 700 people arrived in the state capital alone until 8 a.m. , a spokes@@ man said in the morning . &quot;
&quot; after the re@@ introduction of controls at the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees reached the city on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; Stuttgart : er@@ un@@ ner of tropical storm &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; expected in the southwest &quot;
meteor@@ ologists warn against storms in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
&quot; because of a low @-@ pressure area over Western Europe , warm sea air flows into the country , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) released in Stuttgart . &quot;
&quot; the powerful low is the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; , &quot; which was drawn over the Atlantic by the Bermuda Islands in the past days . &quot;
heavy storms and thunder@@ storms are expected mainly in Baden .
&quot; according to DW@@ D , up to Thursday morning also in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the bottom @-@ seek@@ er with gu@@ sts of 60 to 90 kilometres per hour can be expected . &quot;
forecasts illustrate how the market is set to change .
the crowd makes it : every two years the car@@ makers show their novel@@ ties at the IAA .
2015 is above all a movement among the compact cars that are currently selling particularly well .
&quot; cars from the compact class are currently in high demand : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations were accounted for by the &quot; &quot; Kraft@@ fahrt &quot; &quot; ( German ) Federal Office ( KBA ) alone in August . &quot;
this is reflected also at the IAA ( public days 17 to 27 September ) .
many new compact models will be introduced this year between all the futur@@ istic conceptual vehicles and new luxury cars .
&quot; one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German automotive industry is the Opel Astra , which will be at deal@@ er@@ ships in the fall . &quot;
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the trade fair . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra should not be much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Rüssel@@ sheim . Opel introduces a gateway to the biggest competitor VW Golf , which starts at 17 650 euros . &quot;
the current Astra will cost from 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is available with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , H@@ esse supplies further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for which three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines are also counted for the first time . &quot;
&quot; unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is initially only five @-@ door . &quot;
&quot; the second variant will follow in the spring of the station wagon , which can also be seen at the IAA . &quot;
and what will be done next to the Astra at the IAA in new compact cars ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra ri@@ vals Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
&quot; at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively available as a fifth in a conventional and an emphasized sporty GT @-@ version . &quot;
&quot; in the trade , he comes next year , then also as a comb@@ i . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan designers plan to find their position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines adapts fully to the design line of the brand .
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
&quot; in the offer , however , a diesel engine with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp is also available . &quot;
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
&quot; the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp . &quot;
the maximum torque is 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) according to manufacturer &apos;s specifications .
the sales launch of the bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
&quot; DS 4 : not entirely new , but completely renewed , the compact class model DS 4 , which can be seen at the IAA . &quot;
&quot; on the outside , the designer of the Nob@@ le Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n Ab@@ leg@@ ger was mainly working on the front end : here the radiator gri@@ lle was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights equipped with LED technology . &quot;
&quot; the interior was mainly moderni@@ zed by the inf@@ ot@@ ainment system , the number of buttons reduced by a touch screen and integrated for the first time Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there are a number of re@@ visions and new variants on the IAA in the compact class , such as the ris@@ ked Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI . &quot;
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are deser@@ ted
&quot; the Federal Constitutional Court has given a ex @-@ in@@ mate of the pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary institution Te@@ gel , which was housed in a small cell for months . &quot;
&quot; because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in too small cells . &quot;
this has been decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision issued on Wednesday .
&quot; according to the judges , the persons concerned can even hope for money if they were imprisoned in confined spaces only a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) . &quot;
&quot; with this , an ex @-@ in@@ mate with its constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : it was housed in a single cell with approximately five square meters of ground surface between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally not separated . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man who was now on the open foot according to his lawyer , had been reloc@@ ated to a larger cell . &quot;
his term of office because of the un@@ worthy conditions of detention against the State of Berlin failed .
&quot; however , the Constitutional Court rev@@ oked the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ al and returned the case for renewed examination . &quot;
they see the man &apos;s dignity hurt .
chamber court decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; even if for legal reasons , only a few days of detention have been decisive for the compensation , an explanation was given . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; a cur@@ v@@ ature of the legal protection of the personality would be feared . &quot;
the chamber court must now clarify the level of the damage compensation .
&quot; in the past , the constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of war . &quot;
&quot; so they only spoke to a det@@ ain@@ ee in April , because he was imprisoned naked in a cell . &quot;
&quot; according to a decision of 2011 , un@@ worthy is also the multiple assignment of a cell without separate toilet . &quot;
&quot; furthermore on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had agreed to an in@@ decent housing to a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 . &quot;
the former pla@@ inti@@ ff was lod@@ ged between 15 and 21 hours daily between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
&quot; in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons have also hit the head@@ lines for lack of personnel . &quot;
&quot; det@@ ain@@ ees are therefore always included 23 hours , which increases aggres@@ si@@ veness , even to fights , it should have come because of the ten@@ se situation . &quot;
&quot; according to information from the Justiz@@ pres@@ se@@ stelle , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied due to junior lack , 19 should fall away in 2016 . &quot;
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are creating the &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the German chan@@ cell@@ or is determined to accept it .
what is coming to Germany ?
&quot; according to the report by Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up a million refugees . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) has demonstrated decisi@@ veness in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can do that and we do that . &quot;
what comes to Germany gives the following overview .
&quot; according to different progn@@ oses , between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Construction ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments are used annually - and for the next five years . &quot;
&quot; this is almost twice as much as it has been built up to now ( 250@@ ,000 dwell@@ ings ) . &quot;
&quot; the lack of housing , however , is dramatic above all for affordable rental objects : every year 60,000 to 80@@ ,000 social apartments fall out of the rental market , and these particularly cheap homes will also apply for refugees . &quot;
&quot; Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) is therefore aiming to double the funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ est@@ el Institute &apos;s point of view is far too little : 80 000 social housing each year would have to be built , and the federal government would have to invest EUR 6.@@ 4 billion per year . &quot;
&quot; in addition , scientists and Federal Minister of Construction agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in residential construction . &quot;
&quot; according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , 55 per cent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term . &quot;
&quot; according to Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education . &quot;
but for the integration of refugees it is crucial if they find work in Germany .
&quot; the work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ essen . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , according to the Thr@@ es@@ hardt , it has been a political change : from the prohibition of work for refugees to recognise jobs . &quot;
&quot; while there was previously a ban on work for asylum seekers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , just like the obligation to pay asylum seekers to a place of residence . &quot;
&quot; in society , also because of the shortage of skilled labour , the view has become widely accepted , that refugees should be able to access the labour market faster . &quot;
a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is lacking knowledge of German .
&quot; so far , there is no sufficient supply of general and occupational language courses . &quot;
studies also show that jobs are most often medi@@ ated through personal contacts .
therefore the building of networks is therefore according to the view from Thr@@ es@@ hardt the Royal Road to work integration .
&quot; the Berlin School Administration has found that only a few escaped parents give their children to Kit@@ as , an estimated 10 to 15 percent : &quot; for the dis@@ car@@ ded parents , it is first of all important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ et@@ bar , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Senate Administration in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in order to convince the family of the benefits of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages . &quot;
&quot; if the demand for educ@@ ators is increasing by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - for example by allowing more specialised schools . &quot;
&quot; in the countries , pupils without knowledge of German are prepared in the classes . &quot;
&quot; however , they are not always taught by qualified teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ em from the Berlin School Administration . &quot;
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that around 20 per cent of refugees are going to study in Germany .
&quot; in principle , no federal state does not prohi@@ bit asylum seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception to date has been Berlin , interior sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has given up his stance . &quot;
study willing refugees could be facilit@@ ated by access to the university .
&quot; because refugees with a res@@ titu@@ tion or toler@@ ation do not receive any benefits under the asylum seekers power law more , if they begin studying . &quot;
&quot; the latter , in principle , do not receive a b@@ af@@ ö@@ g , since they do not fall under the circle of persons entitled to b@@ af@@ e . &quot;
&quot; tolerated refugees have had to have lived in Germany for four years to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from January 1 , 2016 , this pan will be shortened to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but this financing gap must be closed , but Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s Secretary of State for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk . &quot;
students should immediately get b@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
&quot; Islam will play a more important role in future , as many refugees are Muslims and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should gradually give Islam the same rights as they have the churches , and to further develop the existing state church law to a new state @-@ religion ratio . &quot;
&quot; the foundation of an Islamic welfare organization , which takes care of newcom@@ ers in a professional manner , would also be important . &quot;
the rights also include duties .
&quot; thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and grant him certain control possibilities . &quot;
this also includes the willingness to heed the fundament@@ alism of religious fundament@@ alism .
&quot; the chairman of the Central Council of the Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to extract such conflicts in Germany immediately &quot; have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
&quot; in the future , integration will be much more than today a topic of the whole society . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the majority society will have to change and the reduction of discrimination and racism is more pressing . &quot;
&quot; indeed , Germany has - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination authority and a general equality law since a decade . &quot;
but it is very slow to learn how the NS@@ U mur@@ ders show how the rac@@ ist motive was systematically ignored in the police and authorities .
&quot; equal opportunities for all : what migrants &apos; organisations and stakeholders of non @-@ white German demand for a long time and what international agreements like anti @-@ racism legislation commit to Germany must become reality in the coming years , when the country is to remain peaceful and its new citizens should use their opportunities - for the good of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany is able to provide medical care to the refugees that have been expected so far , &quot; said Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; regarding man@@ power and capacity , we create that , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , additional money must flow into the system for this purpose . &quot;
&quot; to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery demands to susp@@ end all newcom@@ ers immediately when registering their health cards . &quot;
achievements could be expected later with the federal states .
&quot; and in the long term it is highly question@@ able to cut off so many people with the limited power catalogue , which the asylum seekers power law fores@@ ees . &quot;
&quot; apart from that , the doctors make first of all the language barriers . &quot;
&quot; so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has demonstrated that migrants are more enlightened about their illnesses than other patients . &quot;
&quot; translation costs have to be taken over not only in hospitals , but also in doctors &quot; sur@@ geri@@ es . &quot;
but it would have helped many refugees with more general medical points of contact in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
&quot; for example , under refugee children there are clearly more un@@ treated disabilities , and with the young people it is about HIV . &quot;
&quot; but with some of the other diseases German doctors come from their training , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery means . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so hard to recognize . &quot; &quot; and as far as the shortage of doctors is concerned , even allevi@@ ation in sight is possibly allevi@@ ated by the refugees . &quot;
&quot; the Syrians would have a highly developed education system , several refugees are even doctors . &quot;
&quot; to be allowed to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take off examinations . &quot;
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psych@@ ologically ill after estimates by the Federal Psych@@ otherap@@ ist Chamber ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from post@@ traum@@ atic stress disorder or depression .
&quot; especially vulnerable are refugee children , Dietrich Mun@@ z explains , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recent study published by the TU Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee child arrives trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
&quot; those who are suffering from post@@ traum@@ atic stress disorder , among other things , suffer from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with respir@@ ation , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart@@ burn and death . &quot;
&quot; other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders , strong fri@@ ght and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; to prevent symptoms from chron@@ ically , early treatment is necessary , explained Mun@@ z . &quot;
&quot; so far , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees receive psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; although psych@@ ologically ill @-@ looking asylum seekers can put an application for psych@@ otherapy in the social offices , the treatment usually lasts for several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the social offices usually non @-@ skilled workers or doctors who are not trained for mental illness , decide whether treatment is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; with the new &quot; passion , &quot; Circus Pro@@ bst acc@@ esses the traditions of cir@@ cus arts . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to draw each age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment . &quot;
now the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to dream in the Man@@ ege on a brick .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , teacher of animal and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the current stage of management . &quot;
&quot; for more than 33 years , the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family . &quot;
&quot; thus , the gift to the beloved is in the blood of the family . &quot;
&quot; it is important for us to take away people from their everyday lives and take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; emphas@@ ises the 27 @-@ year @-@ old juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; welcome cocktail with cosm@@ opolitan flair , &quot; says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept . &quot;
50 cities on the almost 3 000 kilometer long tour can now experience this flair .
the Circus program convin@@ ces with talented artists from all over the world .
&quot; awarded at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family ev@@ okes the audience with wit and charm . &quot;
also the Castillo brothers understand their craft .

&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; says Steph@@ an@@ ies Mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only too often subject to various animal welfare organizations .
Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst also takes a stand : &quot; if it &apos;s not good for our animals it doesn &apos;t work well .
about 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit .
&quot; the &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes , &quot; as they are lovingly called , are read by the eyes of every wish . &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
&quot; if the animal does not feel comfortable , it does not want to go to the arena . &quot;
the highest command so : take care of the animals .
&quot; especially on her zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land@@ Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a Zeb@@ ra mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud . &quot;
the two animals lived together for eight years in a enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; while the zeb@@ roid isn &apos;t ready for the arena , but it &apos;s the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst . &quot;
there should be something for each visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or more than 200 people , we always give our best and are with our whole heart . &quot;
cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst looks at his ideas daily from 17 to 20 September every day .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 am and 4 pm .
&quot; Thursday is family day , for the performance at 5 pm the prices are reduced . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm . &quot;
Zimbabwe Robert Mu@@ gabe holds wrong speech in parliament
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , dropped down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread over the social media . &quot;
&quot; the opening of the parliament was also clou@@ ded by claims by members of the opposition , that they would have received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech with Bu@@ hr@@ ufen . &quot;
&quot; last month , they had borrow@@ ed him and interrupted him during his speech to the position of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
spokes@@ man for Democratic Change Movement ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , he told journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot;
&quot; it warns the members of Parliament concerned that immunity will end in the Parliament , and as soon as they leave the parliament their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot;
the Chief Spo@@ kes@@ person said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; worried &quot; about the dangers for politicians .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard to reduce up to 30.000 jobs
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the scope of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services . &quot;
&quot; HP will split into two listed companies later this year , separating the computer and printer business from its fast growing corporate hardware and service business activities . &quot;
&quot; the anticipated job reduction leads to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chairman and Chief Executive , managing the unit after separation . &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and stronger than HP today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that help businesses transform to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot;
as an independent company we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world .
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on delivering unprecedented , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; explains the company &apos;s statement . &quot;
it spl@@ its a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to manufacture electrical systems and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage one has called &quot; the birth@@ place of the Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has undergone massive restructuring to address traditional PCs &apos; return to mobile devices .
&quot; HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this field based on the belief that closely focused companies provide better performance . &quot;
FC Arsenal @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team@@ mates must stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; Wen@@ ger points out to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is only September and , if his rehabilitation goes according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas . &quot;
this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four games for England and in the face of his story his involvement in the next summer is certainly uncertain in the European Championship .
the big shame in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it is a bone that does not heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries he had previously .
&quot; this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd &apos;s investigation lists 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Arsen@@ als 157 league games in the last five seasons .
&quot; the broader picture for arsen@@ al is that they were one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 , which have recorded most of the injuries . &quot;
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the injury quot@@ a will last during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a prone period of time , a time in which you need to strengthen your body and win strength strength , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I &apos;m confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves . &quot;
arsen@@ al starts his champi@@ ons League @-@ season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday and Wen@@ ger poses a rotation inside the team .
&quot; H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey did not travel to Croatia , which means that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta should start . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and give players who need it , a little break @-@ off , &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
&quot; although Arsenal &apos;s clear favor@@ ites are to pass through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe . &quot;
&quot; Dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games , after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign was launched last season . &quot;
&quot; the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , measured on the Richter scale 3.2 . &quot;
this year it was the 10th of Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that Arsenal won the lesson from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation to Monaco and remains motivated by the far hope to lead the association to his first European Cup triumph .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it has never worked out at Arsenal .
&quot; we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers . &quot;
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the comedy show giving us serious lessons on male friend@@ ships
&quot; the absence of similar portra@@ y@@ als in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up , now has become more desperate than ever before , like suicide rates among young men on a 15 year high . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it is three times more common among men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to tackle the problem , the Campa@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a pi@@ tiful life ) 2015 marked the year of the man with the aim of questioning the culture that prevents men from seeking help if they need them . &quot;
friendship is the cent@@ er@@ piece in the fight to overcome this challenge .
&quot; a recent study involving more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms stated that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery were doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems . &quot;
&quot; but of course you have to have friends , so that friendship can work . &quot;
&quot; in the age of communication managed by social media , with their focus on the style of substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , life @-@ fun and successful , even if in reality the isolation dominates . &quot;
&quot; this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship , which affects our mental health much deeper . &quot;
&quot; and as a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy luck . &quot;
the Beau@@ tiful at Friends was that this focus was put on his head .
&quot; each character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ one through the interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments at football matches in cozy arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can definitely refer to it , even though they are often reluct@@ ant to fully explore their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as an employee of telep@@ hon@@ y counsel@@ ing , I explained : ... &quot; my listening roll for people who feel de@@ pressed and vulnerable , really showed me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us feel often not able to talk to friends .
&quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; I can cope with it &quot; &quot; has an enormous impact , such as feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when talking about problems openly . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
she clearly presents the little moments of male friend@@ ships .
&quot; so much my objective out@@ si@@ ders status over the phone can help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so , on this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with which to celebrate the day completely re@@ designed backdrop , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or , even better , if you see someone sitting alone in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say h@@ ello . &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from start to finish - all 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
Mary meets to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush the Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani following his match against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria meets in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass to Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held a course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ ing@@ stadium on Tuesday .
&quot; di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his champion League Deb@@ u@@ ts as PS@@ G player , who brought the French Master to the road , but after that they missed a number of occasions before they finally raised their advance when Cav@@ ani made a head@@ ball in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Chess t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish master , as they do not only strive for the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , there was no clas@@ h of Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the association with whom he began his illustri@@ ous career already in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause problems and look back relaxed even if there are certain things we need to perfect over the course of the season , &quot; &quot; said blan@@ c . &quot;
&quot; this is a good sign .
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we did not have one or two more goals scored . &quot;
&quot; after his injury , I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to the Paris team after his injury which could last a 2 : 2 oun@@ t at his own place against Bordeaux in the First Division , but he was replaced by Di Maria in the fourth minute . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ inian wing@@ ed door was referred to as the man who took PS@@ G to the next level in Europe when he entered the last month of Manchester United , and he indicated why when he passed in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind Malm@@ ö &apos;s defense before he passed away nicely into the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malm@@ ö , who suggested Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was a serious opponent with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the mid@@ field . &quot;
&quot; but besides a shot by Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps &apos;s posts in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little help . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G himself sometimes gave up , with some mis@@ ses and bad connections , not least from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was in the first half p@@ atz@@ te alone in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after re@@ bo@@ oting . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which Di Maria turned into a shot , which was ste@@ ered by Wil@@ and at the 5@@ 2nd minute at the pole ... &quot;
the second gate was finally dropped shortly after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans achieved his sixth round of the season after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
&quot; that finished all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could return to the game , and only an excellent intervention from Wil@@ and in the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz was able to keep the end result low before replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi completed a gate at the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December . &quot;
since then we have played only in the Swedish league which has not the same level .
the qualification matches are not sufficient . &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ en@@ core g@@ athers 2.5 billion dollars through share sales
&quot; the mining giant Gl@@ en@@ core , based in Switzerland , affected by collap@@ sing raw materials prices , collected 2.5 billion dollars on Wednesday by a stock sale as part of its huge debt til@@ ting plan . &quot;
&quot; the company Gl@@ en@@ core registered in London in a statement that it sold new shares worth approximately 1.6 billion pounds , to deposit their own debts . &quot;
&quot; the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year , struggles with falling commodity prices , because China &apos;s economic down@@ turn presses demand and has a devastating effect on markets . &quot;
the subscription rights issue brought a rapid rise to the top of the London stock exchange at the early Wednesday morning .
&quot; the share jumped by 2.@@ 77 percent to 1,@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher . &quot;
&quot; Gl@@ en@@ core had announced last week &apos;s $ 2.5 billion share sale as part of the more comprehensive plans to eliminate around a third of its 30 billion $ debt . &quot;
&quot; the company sold the new shares to 125 p@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday . &quot;
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the Group &apos;s share .
&quot; in terms of long @-@ term growth in China , iron ore prices have declined by about half , coal , copper and other raw material prices have declined by 20 to 40 percent . &quot;

&quot; Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping will make a state visit to the USA at the end of the month , confirmed the White House in an explanation on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the visit , the first official in Washington , takes place on September 25th and responds to President Barack Obama &apos;s journey to Beijing last November , said the statement . &quot;
the U.S. President and First Lady Mich@@ elle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ y@@ uan at a State D@@ iner this evening after the two leaders have conducted bilateral talks .
&quot; President &apos;s visit will provide the opportunity to bro@@ aden the American @-@ Chinese cooperation in a series of global , regional and bilateral issues of common interest , but also President Obama and President Xi can give the opportunity to construc@@ tively address areas of dis@@ agreements , &quot; adds the statement . &quot;
&quot; XI , whose visit initially was announced in February , is expected to meet several U.S. technology leaders on his way to Washington before he travels to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Obama and Xi are addressing a number of controversial issues , including Washington &apos;s concerns in China &apos;s alleged cy@@ ber sp@@ ying and growing self @-@ confidence in the disputed waters of the South China Sea . &quot;

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
&quot; a few years ago , FC Bayern was just before the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who then played for FC Barcelona . &quot;
&quot; eight times Spanish champion , three times poker winner , four times champion league winner , two times champion world champion , two times champi@@ ons champion , one time World Champion , one time world champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking . &quot;
&quot; in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona for 24 years and changed to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar . &quot;
&quot; but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i announces that he was already leaving Barcelona before the European Championship in 2008 . &quot;
one told me that Bar@@ ça wants to sell me .
&quot; Madrid won everything , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; he says . &quot;
and the registered share of FC Bayern .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot;
&quot; reminder : in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern . &quot;
guar@@ dian was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this work today for the German record master : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has signed Guardi@@ ola , and I played a great EM . &quot;
PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the crew without me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ erns were running in 2008 / 2009 with X@@ av@@ i .
&quot; X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against Bavaria over the entire distance on the grass , turned the reds out ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and at the end celebrated the King &apos;s triumph . &quot;
matt Dam@@ on plays diversity in film@@ making
matt Dam@@ on confron@@ ts the African American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
&quot; during a series of Sunday Night by HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown under@@ lined the need for alternative perspectives and with respect to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen screen@@ play of the project . &quot;
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it with the occupation of the film and not with the occupation of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot;
&quot; brown re@@ acted shocked , with insul@@ ted un@@ belief and shou@@ ted &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; as the comments of the actor by The Mar@@ tian strengthened himself . &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to ask people to think about - who will always be the director - how they treat the figure of the harmony , &quot; Brown said at first . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a sp@@ line beaten by her white p@@ im@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the producer of Dear White People sat on the film for the fin@@ alists , Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio . Dam@@ on replied that their direction &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
&quot; after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded prior to dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments . &quot;
&quot; t@@ witter user Mr Po@@ oni squee@@ zed his anger over the clip , writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain its variety - that &apos;s SO White that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the twe@@ et earned more than 5,000 items and 4,000 list@@ ets since its publication . &quot;
women &apos;s comments come at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion .
&quot; after having killed Michael Brown in 2014 by a white police officer , the movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter achieved a country @-@ wide effect and urged leg@@ is@@ lators and authorities to put discrimin@@ atory practices against the above @-@ mentioned sti@@ cking . &quot;
&quot; in February , the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards . &quot;
&quot; album Sti@@ ll matter , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) , he said . &quot;
&quot; like books and black life , albums still have their meaning . &quot;
&quot; in recent times , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement published an explanation as reaction to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group . &quot;
&quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders . &quot;
&quot; recently , Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ sts who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the presentation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;
whether he accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crowned first champion
professional sport clim@@ ber and operating aid Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete who won the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; the competition show , which just completed its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could finish all stages of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season finale there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final . &quot;
the last task was climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
&quot; Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time he was the first ath@@ lete to finish the stren@@ uous phase 4 by American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge with three seconds faster than what made him the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news of the hard won victory , still under the shock of winning the Big Prize of $ 1 million . &quot;
&quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or a life , &quot; Isaac E said ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot;
as suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how that is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , even though he first finished the course , did not get any prize money . &quot;
&quot; after the rules , the money goes to the fastest person . &quot;
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , he gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; We@@ ed said . &quot;
&quot; how much money is a wonderful price and life changes , he receives the great classification . &quot;
I don &apos;t think he has any res@@ ent@@ ment on it .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family man .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I am happy that it is Isaac . &quot;
and I think that Isaac would have felt the same if they had changed the roles .
America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or has been extended for an eighth season and the shooting will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not especially funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; in the past , they once were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball . today , the Tig@@ ers are on the last place in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part perfectly on Tuesday against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field . &quot;
the T@@ wins took a chance to climb inside a second half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card Square .
&quot; Detroit , although only for one evening , was a return of the three letter F word that was so hard to believe about a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all wins make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon held his early offensive support upright when Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck 6 times in 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and made three rounds possible .
it was only his third successful start in his final nine games .
&quot; I want to put an end to this year , &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw in the bull@@ pen any game , and so I want to go into the game completely . &quot;
&quot; the designated tiger hit Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two ranks , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August . &quot;
it was the first three @-@ hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on 6th July .
&quot; he has sw@@ ung the Schla@@ gh@@ ol@@ z well , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at the ( punch training ) , looked much better at the bull@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game . &quot;
with three R@@ uns in the back at the end of the seventh inner T@@ wins had their best chance to get into the game again .
center Fiel@@ der B@@ yr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton terminated the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ ds Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a bun@@ t and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
&quot; Har@@ dy passed down the wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , in front of the designated ro@@ ok@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who got a Two @-@ Run escape from the righ@@ tist Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of runners and the finishing run , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play . &quot;
it was the 27th time in the Major League for the 27th time that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe struck a double play
&quot; after Detroit added a Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth time , Wall created an R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; however , the right @-@ handed player stab@@ bed S@@ ano in three Pit@@ ches for his fifth S@@ save . &quot;
Detroit benefited at the start of the game by an un@@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been removed from the vulner@@ ability list after he had been missing more than a month because of a back pain .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I desired , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches as in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first , Br@@ ush gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler . &quot;
a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into the game that made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z created his 0 @-@ 21 series of successes with the Run@@ ners in the scor@@ ing position .
&quot; the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right side , managed another run but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat . &quot;
&quot; the Tig@@ ers laid in the second , achieved a one @-@ out double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center Fiel@@ ds Anthony GO@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; that was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he did not hit particularly well , but he got the right spot . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ Count , did not score points in the third inning before being replaced by the reli@@ ever right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter . &quot;
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three rounds at six hits and a walk with four strokes .
remarks : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the litter school .
&quot; he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the San@@ che@@ z shoulder in 2007 . &quot;
&quot; San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list because of a shoulder distortion , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris is removed from the vulner@@ ability list to start against the T@@ wins . &quot;
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was bought in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on 30 July
he has been missing in the right hip joint since 20 August .
the Tig@@ ers and T@@ wins will end their series of three games in target field on Wednesday
&quot; Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2,@@ 4@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ota &apos;s R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 ) &quot;
hundreds of refugees arrive in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; the people in it will then be accommodated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , such as the city of Wiesbaden , on Tuesday evening . &quot;
she reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 upcoming refugees .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian capital were prepared in the last days for this case .
up to 1000 refugees can be temporarily accommodated there .
they will then be re@@ distributed to other municipalities .
&quot; in the last ten days alone , there were 7@@ 500 people in H@@ esse , responsible for the first admission of the government pres@@ idency of Gie@@ ßen . &quot;
Frankfurt and Han@@ au have also established emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
&quot; the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for a possibility . &quot;
&quot; I believe that the decisive reflection on military options may not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
he accused the European states of &quot; collective om@@ is@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; four years ago , one was happy that the ch@@ ali@@ ce had passed by military involvement in Germany . &quot;
&quot; now the conflict is crashing down at our door@@ step , &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid to refugees .
Austria controls on the south and eastern borders
&quot; in Germany , Austria again introduced controls to its southern and eastern borders . &quot;
&quot; Austrian Minister of Interior , Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , announced on Tuesday evening in Austrian TV station ORF , no one will be sent back to Hungary . &quot;
&quot; in Germany too , no refugees were sent back to Austria . &quot;
&quot; no , it is agreed , &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot;
&quot; on the question of an agreement to which Germany could take up a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mr. Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said there had already been talks between the General Director for Public Safety and representatives of Germany . &quot;
concrete figures did not call them and pointed out for talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
&quot; in recent days , tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route from Hungary . &quot;
their goal is usually Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann requested a special summit next week with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far not been able to agree on a joint action in the crisis . &quot;
the EU interior ministers intend to take a new start to the binding distribution of another 120 000 refugees at a special meeting next Tuesday ( 22 September ) .
&quot; in view of the strong refugee population in Germany , the Federal Government wants to support the countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people more strongly . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ federation will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced in the late Tuesday evening after almost four @-@ hour consultations with the prime ministers in the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Merkel under@@ lined , those people who would need to protect this too . &quot;
but those who don &apos;t have a lead perspective can &apos;t stay in Germany either .
this opinion was shared in the round .
the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; huge effort . &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck in the Balkan route .
Hungary closed its 175 km long border with Serbia on Tuesday .
&quot; a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced that the border with Romania would also have a fence . &quot;
this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to declared Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to on the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
&quot; in Turkey , as witnessed by e@@ ye@@ witness reports , thousands of other migrants were on the way to the Greek border . &quot;
spac@@ ecraft &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean at Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
under the ice @-@ tail of the Satur@@ n@@ monds En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us a global ocean swe@@ eps .
this is what researchers conclude from observation of the spac@@ ecraft &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the moon gli@@ des slightly on its orbit around the ring planet . &quot;
&quot; although this motion is only small but still too big for a continuous solid cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( New York State ) from Tuesday . &quot;
the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
it was known for a long time that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; already in 2006 , Cass@@ ini had discovered ice volcan@@ oes at the south pole of the Satur@@ n@@ monds , sp@@ itting water vap@@ or and ice particles , feeding the so @-@ called electric ring of Saturn . &quot;
&quot; at least at the south pole , there must be a sub@@ terranean sea , the astronom@@ ers concluded at that time . &quot;
but the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clear .
R@@ ama missing 1860 München for several weeks
the 1860 München has to do without Val@@ det R@@ ama for about a month .
&quot; an investigation brought an ad@@ duc@@ tor &apos;s injury to the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , the association divided . &quot;
R@@ ama had already compla@@ ined about pain at the beginning of the week .
&quot; according to &quot; &quot; Munich Lion &quot; , &quot; the diagnosis &quot; &quot; is expected for four weeks of forced break . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is hard for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ ber loss . &quot;
&quot; of course , we must pon@@ der now , &quot; said Sport Director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n to the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of a uni@@ form@@ less professional . &quot;
&quot; however , as a training guest , the six@@ ties initially presented a defensive man . &quot;
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract at the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; at present , the Cro@@ at has &quot; the opportunity to prove his skill . &quot; &quot;
&quot; after his conc@@ ussion , Tor@@ j@@ äger Rub@@ in Ok@@ ot@@ ie can return to team training again next week . &quot;
the Austrian national player is expected to embar@@ k on a running training on Thursday .
&quot; in the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) , Ok@@ ot@@ ie was injured in a violent collision at his head . &quot;
&quot; against the first fears , however , he remained without a serious sh@@ amp@@ er . &quot;
no diet fruit - man@@ gos contain lots of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
&quot; but he who wants to pay attention to his slender line , is often dis@@ cour@@ aged by them . &quot;
because man@@ goes contain relatively much sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
&quot; nevertheless , the exotic fruits are healthy : in them B vitamins and vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ goes contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor beta carot@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; those who eat the fruit therefore supports vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body . &quot;
&quot; when buying , Man@@ gos should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasantly . &quot;
the colour alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ goes can taste very tasty .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
&quot; then , of course , they taste pure or in sweet foods . &quot;
&quot; a man@@ go , however , also gives hearty dishes a special touch . &quot;
it mel@@ ts the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
&quot; a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and game . &quot;
the US parcel service U@@ PS supplies up to 9@@ 5000 aids for the Christmas business in the USA .
&quot; the company has already started recruitment of seasonal workers , U@@ PS announced on Tuesday . &quot;
especially drivers are looking for .
&quot; last year , U@@ PS increased its workforce by 9@@ 5,000 aid for the holiday season . &quot;
&quot; in view of the bo@@ oming on @-@ line business , U@@ PS and his rival F@@ ed@@ Ex since last year have been making arrangements to be ready for the Christmas business . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , delayed deliveries have brought the parcel service to harsh criticism . &quot;
&quot; first flush , then striking cold front &quot;
&quot; in the coming night , in the valleys of the alpine side of the fo@@ eh@@ n , through how Met@@ e@@ o@@ Schweiz shared on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday and during the night to Thursday , the fo@@ eh@@ n blows partly with a stub@@ ble through the pe@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; after fo@@ eh@@ ement on Thursday morning we cross a striking cold front , which brings strong ra@@ ins , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature decline . &quot;
&quot; as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a communication , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low pressure area above the British Is@@ les in a powerful southwest exposure . &quot;
&quot; on the north side of the Alps , the F@@ öhn stops in the night through the valleys . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the F@@ öhn wind up until Thursday morning in the fine valleys with bu@@ cks of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and partly in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with over 100 km / h . &quot;
&quot; the fo@@ eh@@ n can advance to the adjacent centre of the Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and on the mountains are even organs of more than 120 km / h possible . &quot;
&quot; while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my F@@ öhn provides for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity starts to dust on the alpine slope . &quot;
&quot; here , rain starts , which lasts until Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; in total , more than 100 liters of rain per square meter should be expected south of the Alps in the next 48 hours , depending on the amount of rainf@@ all over the last few days . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning , blow up the air , as a result a cold front rolls with strong , partly thunder@@ ous rain from west to east across Switzerland . &quot;
&quot; together with the cold front , the wind dri@@ es strongly until stor@@ my , and the temperatures drop significantly . &quot;
&quot; the following days are in the North autumn with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the other hand , it becomes sunny and warmer at the weekend with up to 25 degrees . &quot;
Rome now has a Martin Luther square
&quot; almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther square in Rome . &quot;
&quot; in the presence of city president Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino , a hitherto nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill on Wednesday was christ@@ ened on the name of the German Re@@ former . &quot;
&quot; on the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now honoured as a &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing ceremony had been applied for by the Working Group of the Evangel@@ ical Churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could only live their faith in the city of the pop@@ es over the centuries . &quot;
&quot; symbo@@ lically , with the square , it becomes apparent that their tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome . &quot;
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was a young August@@ inian mon@@ k at the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he felt the city at that time as a rotten ab@@ sc@@ ess .
&quot; according to historians , his negative impressions are likely to have strengthened him in his later fight against Rome . &quot;
Luther then initiated the division of the Oc@@ ci@@ dent Church with his thes@@ es against the aband@@ on@@ ment .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) crown of thorns is one of the masterpieces that Ot@@ mar Old has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost wrote the introduction and updated the Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible , which has now appeared with gorgeous pictures . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs . &quot;
&quot; his &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but what is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , the respective topics can be quite ble@@ ak . &quot;
&quot; for about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project , for which he has met a subjective @-@ artistic selection from the many theme areas of the &quot; book of all books . &quot; &quot;
&quot; cycles that deal with topics such as cross@@ roads , pla@@ gues , commandments or father@@ land have ar@@ isen . &quot;
he has thus spontaneously fascinated several partners : this applies to Luther @-@ Verlag with his the@@ ological focus as well as for the Kettler publishing house with his focus on art books .
&quot; and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who , on the basis of painting , has dealt with the respective biblical passages . &quot;
&quot; he interpreted the biblical passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and thus translated into &quot; &quot; today , in current contexts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirror by Al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded between the original quotation of Martin Luther and a set of the artist who puts his personal thoughts on the situation here .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
&quot; thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high degree of in@@ timacy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict protest@@ ant ruler . &quot;
&quot; the education came already with the cane , &quot; recalls Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot;
&quot; I have tried to work on it , and perhaps also to carry me back with the Lord Father again . &quot;
&quot; his second aim is to revi@@ ve art in the quick@@ y time : &quot; the perception of visual worlds is today marked by advertisement , and that is loud . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is displaced .
artists have a different desire and delight to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants to let the viewers fall into the pictures , let them appear , discover and feel what power they have : &quot; the picture is looking for his counterpart . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; &quot; always &quot; &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
&quot; I did not care to capture the Bible completely , but also chosen the most important , even mysterious subjects . &quot;
&quot; this was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it &apos;s about the pictures , the text merely explains . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler of Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar &apos;s paintings speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and of responsibility .
part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on 15 November at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation .
start of construction for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn
&quot; plans were made , space found , company commissioned , earth guar@@ dian modelling for a circuit : a year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X train , it was already an end . &quot;
&quot; mis@@ understand@@ ings in politics and administration were responsible for the dr@@ one , especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the railroad . &quot;
&quot; so hills deposited , new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permission . &quot;
&quot; the approval will be made in October , the First Public Prosecutor Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now able to communicate in the children &apos;s and youth committee . &quot;
&quot; I hope this year will still happen , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it should then be started without a &quot; &quot; further pause &quot; &quot; with the work at the former indoor pool . &quot;

&quot; I consider it the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; no one can say that in principle , that doesn &apos;t matter , I don &apos;t have anything to do with it . &quot;
&quot; this must be interested in getting a grip on this topic , &quot; said DF@@ B boss Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively . &quot;
&quot; I am in the Chanc@@ ellery next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State , Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the topic will certainly play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
football can and wants to help .
but the decisive turn@@ out must be policy .
the German Football Association has therefore extended its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; by four years .
&quot; the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation ensured that this programme continues to 2019 , &quot; explained Ni@@ ers@@ bach at the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
some federal li@@ gi@@ sts also support this program .
&quot; already on this weekend , the 36 professional associations set a clear sign when they are on the left Tri@@ kot@@ är@@ d instead of the usual sponsor logo ( Her@@ mes ) the im@@ print &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen the sports director Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler of the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee drama says everyone , nobody is allowed to see . &quot;
&quot; we can use football Bundes@@ liga , no , we have to use our radi@@ ance , influence , and opportunities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent character of the League . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale . &quot;
&quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; a large community work of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 lic@@ en@@ sees had started their own projects in their places was magnificent .
it is just as magnificent that small and small clubs are active .
&quot; the message &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; that we spent is lived in football . &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous significance , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in this and next year , the association together with the German Federal Government &apos;s DF@@ B and the Federal Government provides 300@@ ,000 euros each for the integration of refugees . &quot;
&quot; the clubs have already called up the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
reports : SAP Executive Board loses an eye in case of accident
&quot; the board of directors of Europe &apos;s largest software corporation , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has re@@ port@@ edly lost the left eye to several reports by a fall in early July . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the accident at the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA , he had fallen on a water glass following midnight , which he held in the left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is almost ble@@ ed@@ less , he was power@@ less , then tow@@ ed out to the street - he told us this last week , &quot; said the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could do his job .
&quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot;
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager was at the meeting and &quot; fully working . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung ( Thursday edition ) , Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced that he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to lead the software company . &quot;
&quot; I am full for SAP , full of my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the supervisory board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP head office in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal story , said the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; : &quot; everyone can happen this way . &quot;
it &apos;s important to stand up again when you &apos;ve fallen .
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen out of battle ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ tered a photo and explained that he suffered the injury when he was top@@ pled by the wheel .
&quot; in Singapore on the weekend , he also comes as little as a reserv@@ ist for the two Stam@@ mer@@ il@@ ot Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button , just like a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan . &quot;
football : Bv@@ B without Re@@ us against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : turn@@ table in the gate
&quot; at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us in the first group game of the Europa League have finally broken . &quot;
the national player will be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga as well in the du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19@@ .00 clock / Sky ) .
&quot; we cannot resort to him , &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ Game against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B coach left openly : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; given the high load of its professionals , Tu@@ ck@@ les will not only change their root elf into the Re@@ us position . &quot;
he announced a change to the position of the door keeper .
&quot; therefore , Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of family keeper Roman vou@@ ki . &quot;
&quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion . &quot;
&quot; if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is used in all Europe league games in the future , however , Tu@@ ck@@ les left open . &quot;
&quot; with high probability , he will also contest the second game . &quot;
&quot; the for@@ ebo@@ ding statement by Mit@@ ten Re@@ us , that the final entry for the BV@@ B in the Europa League must be the target , mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian Wei@@ gl will consider : &quot; this is not so wrong with Marco . &quot;
I think we have a good chance to pick up the title .
robot cars : government wants to lead the way for Germany
&quot; according to the federal government &apos;s will , Germany should be a technological pioneer in changing the car . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt at the edge of the Auto Show IAA from a &quot; new mobility era . &quot;
&quot; automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and provide less traffic jams , &quot; said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t . &quot;
&quot; he wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 countries , which also come together with representatives of the industry at the IAA . &quot;
&quot; among other things , the Ministry of Transport &apos;s strategy paper emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and rapid increase in digital radio communications . &quot;
&quot; to test new technology , a test track is currently underway on the 9 motorway in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; in order for the driver to &quot; avoid any additional liability risks , &quot; the Federal Government wishes to &quot; check the legal framework &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; for example , Germany wants to use internationally for the permissible maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 km / h . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the federal government wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which so far only fores@@ ees the human being as a driver . &quot;
&quot; automated driving increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more a passenger . &quot;
the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
&quot; according to a study by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically feasible . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads &quot; are expected to be expected only a long way after 2020 . &quot;
&quot; value added in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions in Germany , the authors of the study estimate for 20@@ 25 to some 8.@@ 4 billion euros . &quot;
&quot; the digital networking of passenger cars can lead to increased safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said the SPD transport politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
&quot; however , the question of liability in accidents and the security of the driver &apos;s personal data must be clearly clari@@ fied . &quot;
but the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are still skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
&quot; a survey of the For@@ sa Institute commissioned on Wednesday at the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the investig@@ ator Dek@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent do not believe in it at all in 20 years . &quot;
&quot; in France , 21 percent of those surv@@ eyed up to 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars account for 33 percent in the USA . &quot;
&quot; in any case , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle . &quot;
&quot; after a survey by the digital alliance Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control during the entire journey on all roads . &quot;
&quot; on the motorway , the traffic in flowing traffic could still imagine 15 percent , in traffic jams 45 percent . &quot;
&quot; well , each fourth would give the car control under no circumstances . &quot;
Bol@@ l says team and double start at table tennis @-@ EM
&quot; according to their current status , the Düsseldorf @-@ based Dus@@ sel@@ dorf will only hit singles in singles from 25 September to 4 October . &quot;
the final decision shall be made at the latest on 22 September .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the guys have experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough to get the title even without Timo , &quot; said the head coach Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf in Düsseldorf during the EM training course . &quot;
Bol@@ l was at this time on the flight to a long @-@ term scheduled sponsor@@ ing event in China .
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German champion is expected on Friday .
&quot; without Timo , the down@@ side , we are no longer such a clear favourite , &quot; &quot; stated Individu@@ al @-@ Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot;
&quot; Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the net@@ list in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded the EM 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at . &quot;
&quot; at that time Timo also ste@@ als , and we have become European champion . &quot;
&quot; we should ori@@ ent ourselves to this , &quot; explained the Fi@@ fth @-@ Leader of the World . &quot;
the British football team Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United has suffered a severe injury on the right leg .

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant terrible
it is a mixture of very large fashion show and a wax figures Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : mannequins which look frigh@@ ten@@ ingly human thanks to video projections .
&quot; they carry the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the great star of fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and with it that he put men in skir@@ ts . &quot;
today I can no longer say that I am the en@@ f@@ ant terrible of Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair .
&quot; in the past it was ble@@ ached , meanwhile it &apos;s real , &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the Bürger@@ stei@@ g to the cat@@ walk ) , which can be seen at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung from September 18 onwards , it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his initially negative attitude to a show about his person . &quot;
&quot; actually he had been against it , because : &quot; for me , an exhibition sounded a bit of death , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if you die , you come to the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ der . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society . &quot;
the exhibits give an insight into the work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
&quot; the show is not structured chron@@ ologically , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ed overall artwork , for which much effort was done : to fr@@ ise the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was hired . &quot;
&quot; according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the makers sent 14 tons of material to Munich . &quot;
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was still a special treat : a leather trousers outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a little different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers old Ted@@ dy is to be seen in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , tent@@ ative fashion attempts of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put clothes on his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and dresses , said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; to play with a doll , his parents wouldn &apos;t have allowed him . &quot;
he later taught the t@@ oss of fashion by himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers like Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought them of course .
he did not have to pay the models for his first show .
&quot; they got nothing , but were allowed to keep the clothes . &quot;
jewellery instead of curtain - P@@ en top as a fashion niche
&quot; in the past , it was about the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make meters . &quot;
&quot; the embroi@@ dered fabrics and lace were created in a large quantity for customers , for example to apply them to blankets and she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this alone does not work anymore , says Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of P@@ lau@@ en &apos;s coff@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; instead , fashion is again important . &quot;
&quot; in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ ener Sp@@ itz , fashion played a major role , was then displaced by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls a number of examples : lace in jewelry , accessories such as bags and regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; at all , the so @-@ called vintage fashion that leans on past stal@@ ks is an increasing order potential . &quot;
anyone who does not use ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market .
&quot; with us , they already make up half of all orders . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
&quot; over the last 15 years , some 80 percent of sales have been broken off . &quot;
private specialty shops and wholesale trade are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
&quot; nowadays , mass @-@ ware is produced much cheaper in the Asian region and is sold almost exclusively via chains . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the export , currently in Russia and the USA , weak@@ ens . &quot;
there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association also tries to score points with environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer follows from the embroi@@ dery in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year , we have been leading a quality seal which shows that we are ec@@ ologically and socially responsible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also applies to the materials used .
designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berger branch of the West@@ säch@@ sische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and special@@ ises in embroi@@ der@@ ies and lace .
&quot; to counter the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
it takes time and courage .
&quot; this creates a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that need to think , above all , economically &quot; , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design is often only slightly varied in order to maintain a customer base . &quot;
&quot; a few years ago , Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter re@@ vit@@ alized the historic snow@@ ball . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the machine rocks small spheres in some places . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ lau@@ en gol@@ ds@@ mi@@ thing master Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße was inspired by this : &quot; before , I couldn &apos;t do anything with traditional P@@ lau@@ ener Sp@@ itz . &quot;
now she uses the tip of the snow for her jewelry .
&quot; in an elaborate procedure , she shapes the pattern in silver . &quot;
&quot; many people in the region identify with the theme of P@@ lau@@ en Sp@@ itz - young and old , &quot; Reu@@ ter says . &quot;
&quot; it also supplies to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and who would like to remember them . &quot;
&quot; with that , I see my jewellery as a modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ en Sp@@ itz . &quot;
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
&quot; legends are not to be touched , but Disney still dar@@ es a new film of his classic &quot; &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; it is not a re @-@ film , but a kind of continuation , which plays the magical children &apos;s girl 20 years after the first film . &quot;
it is about the experience of N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the global economic crisis in England .
who plays P@@ opp@@ in more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
&quot; but the director is already clear : Ro@@ b Marshall , last with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema . &quot;
XI ur@@ ges to open the economy wide for the world
&quot; the economy has to open wide to the outside in order to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday a group commissioned with the steering of the reform . &quot;
&quot; China should strive to attract foreign investments and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Executive Committee to deep@@ en a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; promoting new start @-@ ups and driving forward reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth , said Xi . &quot;
&quot; the leadership group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list to regulate market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the population reporting system . &quot;
&quot; after the statement , a negative list is created which identifies sectors and companies that do not come into question for investments . &quot;
the system is being tested and improved by testing programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance , as it gives the market a greater role in allocation of resources , ensures a legally state business environment and open the market more open , said the statement . &quot;
the government will also lo@@ osen controls on the powers transferred to companies and make sure companies decide how to manage their business .
the statement also stated that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
&quot; within the framework of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ financed corporations and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for permanent residence permit or &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot;
&quot; the right of lawyers to guarantee their activities , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot;
Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated in the meeting as reported in a statement released after the meeting .
EU wants to double the mercury limit in predat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predat@@ ory fish and thus exploit a significantly higher dose of the tox@@ in .
&quot; the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , which is a corresponding EU work paper , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policies are passed on with full growth to pregnant women and to@@ dd@@ lers , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t from F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t , the limit values of the nerve po@@ ison@@ ous for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish from &quot; economic policy reasons &quot; are lifted from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish . &quot;
&quot; big predat@@ ors , however , already today are so heavily loaded with mercury that , on the basis of the still current limit values , approximately 50 per cent of catches may not be sold . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be in@@ conceivable . &quot;
&quot; in exchange for this e@@ asing , the EU wants to ag@@ grav@@ ate the limit values of other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; but F@@ ood@@ watch described this as &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller Fried@@ fishes , such as car@@ p , are usually so low loaded that they are already meeting the planned maximum values today . &quot;
&quot; the sin@@ king at Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; a fine distra@@ ction maneu@@ ver , which alone helps the economy , &quot; explained wolf sch@@ mid@@ t . &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal which is highly toxic to humans . it is mainly concentrated in predat@@ ory fish over the food chain .
&quot; the German government , therefore , cau@@ tions that &quot; low quantities can cause particularly un@@ born damage to the nervous system . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Federal Environment Ministry explains on its homepage with regard to the current maximum values , but that a &quot; health threat to the general population &quot; is not expected . &quot;
mercury is primarily due to coal combustion to the environment .
&quot; according to a written report by the German Federal Environment Ministry , the German coal @-@ fired power plants meet more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total quantity issued in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mercury in fish , for example in Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; permanently and nationwide exceeded , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; had quoted in March out of the paper . &quot;
&quot; last year , European warnings of mercury in fish have already counted among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF . &quot;
