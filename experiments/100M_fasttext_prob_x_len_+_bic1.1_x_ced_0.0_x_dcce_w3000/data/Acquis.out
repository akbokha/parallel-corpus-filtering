&quot; II ) Information about investments shall be limited to the minimum level , which is necessary for the use of securing measures relating to core material , which is subject to the securing measures according to this Convention . &quot;
&quot; C ) On the request of the community , the organization is prepared to test investment data that the community considers to be particularly vulnerable in the premises of the community . &quot;
&quot; these data do not need to be processed by the organization , provided they remain accessible for further examination by the organization in the premises of the Community . &quot;
a ) i ) The organization ob@@ tains the consent of the community and states to the nam@@ ing of inspec@@ tors for the states .
&quot; II ) If the Community canc@@ els the Community either against a proposed designation or at any time against a designation , the organization of the Community and the States proposes one or more alternative nom@@ inations . &quot;
&quot; if , due to the repeated refusal of the community , to appro@@ ve the nam@@ ing of inspec@@ tors of the organization , which are hin@@ dered by this Convention , the Council will discuss the refusal , after it referred to the General Director of the Organization - in the following as the &quot; General Director , &quot; with the aim of meeting appropriate measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The Community and the States concerned are taking the necessary steps to ensure that the inspec@@ tors of the organization , which are actually able to perform tasks according to their agreement . &quot;
C ) The visits and activities of the inspec@@ tors of the organization are arranged in such a way that i ) the possible har@@ ass@@ ment and distur@@ b@@ ance for the community and the states and for which the inspec@@ ting peaceful nuclear activities are as low as possible ;
II ) safegu@@ arding industrial secrets and other confidential information entrusted to the inspec@@ tors of the organization .
&quot; each state applies to the organization , including its assets , assets and assets , as well as to its inspec@@ tors and other officials , to fulfill the provisions of the agreement on the rights and liber@@ ties of the International Atom@@ ic Energy Organisation . &quot;
&quot; the securing measures according to this Convention are terminated in terms of core material when the Community and the Organisation find that the material is consumed or dil@@ uted in such a way that it is no longer usable for a nuclear activity , which is under the point of the securing measures of Bel@@ ang , or has become practically non @-@ re@@ usable . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with this Convention , the Community announces the transfer of core material from the States which is subject to the security measures according to this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the securing measures pursuant to this Convention shall be terminated in terms of core material , as soon as the recipient state , as envis@@ aged in this Convention , has assumed responsibility for this . &quot;
&quot; the organisation carries out documents from which any transfer , and , if necessary , the re@@ use of the securing measures to the given core material . &quot;
&quot; if nuclear material , which is subject to securing measures pursuant to this Convention , shall be used for non @-@ nuclear activities , such as the production of alloys or ceramics , the Community agrees with the organization of such use of the material under which circumstances the securing measures according to this agreement can be terminated in relation to this material . &quot;
II ) that the score is not used during the duration of the non @-@ application of the securing measures according to this Convention for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices .
B ) The organization and the community meet a provision that the safegu@@ ards provided in this Convention shall not be applied for as long as the core material is used for such activity .
&quot; as far as possible , the regulation will determine how long and under which circumstances these securing measures will not be applied . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the safegu@@ ards provided in this Convention will be applied once again as soon as the core material is returned to a peaceful nuclear activity . &quot;
&quot; the organization is held on the basis of the total quantity and composition of this material present in the concerned State or the concerned States , and on any passing on of such material from this state or these states . &quot;
&quot; this explains its agreement as quickly as possible ; it extends only to matters such as temporal and proced@@ ural conditions and agreements for reporting , but does not include a endor@@ sement or a secret knowledge of the military activity , nor does it apply to the un@@ successful use of the core material . &quot;
&quot; the organization , the community and the states bear the costs that each of them grows in carrying out their respective obligations under this Convention . &quot;
&quot; if the community , the states or persons who are subject to their jurisdiction , but extraordinary costs as a result of a special request of the organization , the organization reimbur@@ ses these costs insofar as it has agreed beforehand in advance . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the organisation carries out the costs of all additional measurements and sam@@ pl@@ ings required by the inspec@@ tors of the organization . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the States make sure that the liability insurance for nuclear damages , including insurance or other financial security , may be applicable to the organization and its officials for the purposes of carrying out this Convention in the same way as to the nation@@ als of the states . &quot;
any claim asser@@ ted by the Community or a State against the Organization or the Organization against the Community or a State for Dam@@ ages - except for Dam@@ age from a nuclear incident that resulted from the implementation of the security measures according to this Convention shall be governed in accordance with international law .
&quot; after examining the relevant information provided by the General Manager , the Council shall ensure that no core material , which must be subject to security measures according to this Convention , may reimbur@@ se the reports provided in Article X@@ II ( C ) of the Stat@@ utes and , if necessary , take the other measures fores@@ een there . &quot;
&quot; in such steps , the Council takes into account the certainty of which mass is acquired by the security measures applied , and offers the community or the state - as far as each of the two parties concerned is affected - every reasonable opportunity to give the Council the necessary security . &quot;
&quot; in the search of the organization , the community or a state consultations on questions arise from the interpretation or application of this Convention . &quot;
the Community and the States are entitled to seek out that questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be examined by the Council .
the Council invites the community and the affected state to participate in the discussion of such questions by the Council .
&quot; with the exception of disputes concerning an arbit@@ ration of the Council in accordance with Article 19 or any of the measures taken by the Council , disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be lod@@ ged at the request of a party of arbit@@ ration which consists of five arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the community and the states appoint two arbitr@@ ators , the organisation also names two arbitr@@ ators , and the four arbitr@@ ators appoint a fifth to pres@@ ide . &quot;
&quot; if the Community and the States or the Organization have not designated two arbitr@@ ators within thirty days of the application for an arbit@@ ration request , the Community or the Organization may request the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint these arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
the same procedure applies if within thirty days after the nom@@ ination or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been elected .
a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal shall be competent and all decisions require the approval of at least three arbitr@@ ators .
&quot; the resolutions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal shall be binding on the organization , the Community and the States concerned . &quot;
&quot; ( a ) This Convention shall apply to non @-@ nuclear weapons , the contracting party of the contract and become members of the Community ( in force , i ) when the relevant state of the organisation noti@@ fies that its procedures for the entry into force of this Convention are concluded and &quot;
&quot; II ) when the organization of the organisation noti@@ fies that it is able to apply its security measures in relation to this state , for the purposes of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The organization , the community and the states consult one another upon request of one of the contracting parties about a change in this Convention . &quot;
&quot; B ) All changes require the consent of the organization , the community and the states . &quot;
C ) The General Manager shall promptly inform all Member States of the Organization of any amendment to this Convention .
&quot; a ) This Convention shall enter into force on the day the organization of the Community and the States receives the written Noti@@ fication , that their procedures for entry into force are concluded . &quot;
B ) This Convention shall remain in force as long as the States Parties to the Con@@ tract are .
the term &quot; Convention &quot; used in this agreement means the agreement and the protocol .
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine the procedures necessary for the implementation of the provisions of the I on securing measures .
the objective of the safegu@@ ards set out in this Convention is the timely discovery of significant amounts of nuclear material of peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explo@@ sives for unknown purposes as well as the deter@@ rence of such a turn by the risk of early discovery .
&quot; for the achievement of the objective specified in Article 28 , material accounting is used as a preventive measure of fundamental importance , f@@ use with spatial integration and observation as important supplementary measures . &quot;
&quot; the technical conclusion of the tests carried out by the organization is carried out by an explanation in which material quantity , which is not proven for a certain period of time , is listed under specification of the accuracy limits for the specified me@@ gen . &quot;
&quot; when performing their review , the organization after Article 3 makes full use of the Community &apos;s backup system . &quot;
the accounting and control system of the Community for core material according to this Convention is based on a structure in material balance areas .
&quot; in the application of their securing measures , the Community of de procedures and measures will make use of the following types of use and , as far as necessary , see how they are defined in the supple@@ mental agreements and are expe@@ dient : &quot;
&quot; a ) a measuring system to determine the quantities of preserved , produced , lost , lost or otherwise from the stock of the core material and the stock quantity ; &quot;
( B ) assessing the reproduci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ;
&quot; C ) Proced@@ ure for determination , testing and evaluation of differences in the measurements of sender and recipient ; &quot;
e ) Proced@@ ure for assessing accumulation of non @-@ measured stocks and non @-@ measured losses ;
&quot; a protocol and reporting system , which points out the core material stock for each material balance zone and the changes in this inventory including the inputs and outputs of the material balance zone ; &quot;
precau@@ tions to ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Proced@@ ure to reimbur@@ se reports to the organization in accordance with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures according to this agreement do not extend to material in the mining industry or in the processing of ore .
&quot; B ) shall be introduced to the states by ur@@ anium or th@@ ori@@ um@@ containing material , which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described under the letter c ) , so the Community of the Organization shares the quantity and composition of the material , provided it is not introduced specifically for non nuclear purposes ; &quot;
&quot; the core material , which is appropri@@ ated according to composition and purity for fuel production or is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , is leaving the plant or the process phase in which it is produced , or is this core material or other core material produced in a later phase of the nuclear fuel cycle in the States , so it is subject to the other securing measures mentioned in this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The safegu@@ ards provided in this Convention are terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 11 . if the provisions mentioned in Article 11 are not authorized , the association is subject to provisions which are subject to provisions which are subject to provisions . &quot;
&quot; B ) The safegu@@ ards provided in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community are con@@ sensual , that this core material is practically non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able . &quot;
&quot; at the request of the community , the organization exemp@@ ts the following core material from the securing measures according to this Convention : &quot;
a ) special fis@@ sile material when used in grams or smaller quantities as a sensor in instruments ;
&quot; ( B ) Nu@@ clear material , if it is used for non @-@ nuclear activities in accordance with Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and &quot;
&quot; Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is more than 80 % . &quot;
&quot; upon request of the Community , the organization exemp@@ ts core material that would otherwise be subject to security measures pursuant to this Convention , provided that the entire material quantity delivered in the States is not at any time due to this Article in the States &quot;
a ) A total of one kil@@ ogram of special cle@@ av@@ age material that can consist of one or more of the following materials :
&quot; ur@@ anium with an enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of its weight with enrich@@ ment , &quot;
&quot; ur@@ anium with enrich@@ ment , which lies below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ anium , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of its weight with the fi@@ ef@@ old square of enrich@@ ment ; &quot;
a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and depl@@ eted ur@@ anium enrich@@ ing more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
&quot; if the core material is to be processed or stored together with core material , which is subject to the securing measures according to this agreement , precau@@ tions are taken for the re @-@ use of the securing measures on that material . &quot;
&quot; the community meets with the organisation supple@@ mental agreements , which are necessary in the scope which is required for the successful and effective provision of the duties of the organization according to this Convention , in detail as to how the procedures laid down in the Convention are applicable . &quot;
the supple@@ mental agreements can be extended or modified without the change of this Convention in the agreement between the organization and the community .
&quot; the supple@@ mental agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention . the organization , the Community and the States undertake all efforts so that these agreements can enter into force within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the interaction between the organization , the community and the states . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the initial report mentioned in Article 62 , the organisation represents a conden@@ sed inventory of the entire core material in the States , regardless of its origin , and carries out this inventory as a result of the subsequent reports and the results of their investigations . &quot;
&quot; between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) on the other &quot;
&quot; according to GR@@ Ü@@ N@@ DE - a ) The EEC has decided to contribute to the Special Action Programme established at the Conference on International Economic Cooperation , to help the immediate needs of individual countries with low in@@ comes , whose development is ham@@ pered by common res@@ sour@@ cent@@ i problems . &quot;
&quot; C ) It is the objective of the EEC and the Member States that the entire contribution of the Member States shall be linked within six months of the entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve that goal . &quot;
D ) The EEC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted one another about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the central b@@ ind@@ ings to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
&quot; for this purpose , the organisation of the EEC has presented a table from which it is evident in which way it intends to apply the criteria specified in this agreement - &quot;
&quot; the organization al@@ ig@@ ns a special account under the name &quot; &quot; Special Accounts &quot; , &quot; which consists of the funds that the Member States contribute to the Special Financial Account . this account is referred to by the Organization as administrator and used ( in this feature , the organization is referred to as &quot; ste@@ ward &quot; ) , and only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement . &quot;
the special transaction account is separate and managed separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
&quot; the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) Payment shall be made in the form of cash or non @-@ interest deb@@ its of the member state , which must be paid upon request in the currency of the respective state on order of the organization as administrator of the special transaction account and to be deposited at the back office of the organization in the country concerned . &quot;
&quot; B ) Payment shall be made in two inst@@ al@@ ments , namely i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the agreement within 30 days of entry into force of this Agreement or to another between the EEC and the Administr@@ ative appointed time ; &quot;
&quot; II ) the second in the amount of the remainder of the agreement on 1 January 1979 or at any other date agreed between the EEC and the administrator , taking into account the deadlines required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans . &quot;
C ) E@@ ach Member State may wish to make payments before the above mentioned dates .
&quot; according to the usual procedure of the organization , the administrator takes about proportional draw on the cash or the school notes to cover the expenses for the special transaction loan and balance the special transaction in a reasonable manner . &quot;
&quot; in order to grant these loans , the administrator can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the EEC : &quot;
the extent to which international economic factors contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ eeable economic problems ;
( VI ) the composition and tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its further credit card capacity to loan conditions without dis@@ counted ; and
&quot; VII ) to the extent , in which the problems of the countries concerned can be regulated by contributions from other sources . &quot;
&quot; each special transaction loan is used to finance a clearly outlined and rapidly re@@ payable development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral project ) , irrespective of whether it is considered to be a loan program of the organization or not , according to the procedures and practices used for the financing loans funded by the organization . &quot;
&quot; the funds of the special transaction may not be used instead of ordinary funds from the International Bank for Recon@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organisation , which are bound by a loan or credit for a program or project which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; apart from Section 4 , special re@@ payment loans are subject to the same withdrawal conditions which apply to the development loan granted by the organization ; thus , in the case of ten free years , they are re@@ payable in 50 years . &quot;
&quot; a special transaction loan is granted in one or more currencies of the Member States , and can be re@@ payable in these currencies . &quot;
amounts to pay this clock are to be paid directly to the organization that keeps them .
&quot; each special transaction loan is issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in which , in particular , the origin of the means is stated . &quot;
&quot; the recei@@ pts of each special transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services that are produced or produced in developing countries , which are members of the organization and which may be the administrator at the time of loan granted , recipient of a special transaction loan . &quot;
&quot; capital re@@ payments of a special transaction loan take place on the special transaction account , and the amount paid back in the currency of a member state is to be re@@ mitted as soon as possible from the administrator to the Member State concerned . &quot;
&quot; until complete issuing of all special transaction loans , the administrator instruc@@ ts the E@@ WG on the plans and programs approved by the directors for the examination by the directors in preparation and by the directors . &quot;
&quot; during the time of payment of the special transaction loan , the administrator instruc@@ ts the E@@ WG quar@@ terly on the development of the special transaction loan and the expenses incurred for this . &quot;
the administrator transm@@ its the E@@ WG as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the organization a detailed billing of the special transaction account with an opinion of the external audi@@ tor of the organization to this account .
&quot; after full payment of the special transaction loan , the administrator of the E@@ WG sends a detailed report on the projects financed by the special transaction bank as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; the administrator creates and performs appropriate records and invoices , from which contributions are made to the special transaction account , which accounts recei@@ vable from the accounts payable and paid out of the account and the withdraw@@ als to the Member States . &quot;
the EEC and the car@@ et@@ akers work closely together to achieve the goals of this agreement .
&quot; to do this , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker up to the full edition of the funds of the special transaction account , carry out an exchange of ideas on the state of the special transaction account , the progress of programmes financed by special actions or projects and on all other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; this agreement was not entered into force on December 31 , 1978 , or at a later date , which the EEC and the Organisation may , if necessary , do not enter into force , so the agreements and all the obligations of the parties are due immediately . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement , the total amount of capital of all the recei@@ v@@ ables received by the recipients is ref@@ unded and re@@ mitted to the Member States , so this agreement and all the obligations of the parties shall be terminated with immediate effect . &quot;
this agreement requires approval by the Member States and the EEC according to the proced@@ ural provisions of each party .
the governments of the Member States notified the General Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities to conclude the proceedings .
the General Sec@@ retariat conduc@@ ts these noti@@ fications together with a Noti@@ fication on the proper approval of this agreement by the EEC to the organisation .
this agreement becomes effective and enters into force on the first day of the month following the date of receipt of the mentioned noti@@ fications in the organization .
&quot; this agreement is written in two pron@@ oun@@ cements in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , and every word is equally authentic . &quot;
whereas the agreement in the form of a correspondence to am@@ end the An@@ nex A of the Protocol No. 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) is en@@ acted by HA@@ T :
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and Plasma physics
&quot; the EURO@@ PE@@ AN Atom@@ ic Community , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after called &quot; Commission , &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Switzerland , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Bundes@@ rat , &quot; &quot;
&quot; this program includes the creation of a large experimental facility , the J@@ ET project ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation are named after chapter V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty - herein@@ after called &quot; Joint Company J@@ ET . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for several years , Switzerland has been concerned with research in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics and is well acquainted with the area in question . &quot;
&quot; since until the practical use of the controlled nuclear fusion is still extensive work to carry out , it is in the interest of the contracting parties of the present agreement to summ@@ ari@@ ze their respective efforts to avoid unnecessary over@@ laps and to speed up their respective research work that has attained a higher priority level due to the energy crisis . &quot;
&quot; this agreement is intended to enable each contracting party to achieve the greatest possible benefit by combining its research efforts in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics , and accordingly the common objective of this research work , i.e. the cost @-@ moder@@ ately competitive electricity generation by using the controlled nuclear fusion reaction . &quot;
&quot; in order to achieve the objective of the present agreement , the contracting parties are associated with their respective research programmes defined in An@@ nex I and II of this agreement , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom Programme &quot; and &quot; Swiss Program . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure effective co @-@ operation , the Swiss program takes over the long @-@ term goals and forms of cooperation between the Eur@@ atom program ; it will be extended or modified after verification by the organs mentioned in Article 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present agreement , that there may be new activities relevant to the Eur@@ atom program . &quot;
&quot; each time the contracting parties accept a new program , this shall be in place of the programmes listed in An@@ nex I and II to the present agreement . &quot;
the association provided in paragraph 1 is realised through : - adequate participation of each of the contracting parties during the preparation and implementation of the programs of the other party ;
&quot; - Exchange of the staff among the relevant laboratories in the Eur@@ atom Member States , Switzerland and the third countries with which Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; associated third states , &quot; as well as the laboratories that work on the Eur@@ atom program ; &quot;
- mutual right to access to the scientific and technical results of the respective programmes .
&quot; as part of the objective of the present agreement , Switzerland particip@@ ates in the J@@ ET project . &quot;
&quot; in view of the association agreement provided in Article 2 , 1 of this Agreement , the Parties shall include an association agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Association Agreement , &quot; referred to as &quot; Associ@@ ated Organ@@ iz@@ ations , &quot; herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Associ@@ ated Organis@@ ations , &quot; with regard to the realisation of the Eur@@ atom program . &quot;
&quot; with the same objective , Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland is involved in the time of entry into force of the present agreement on the promotion of human resource exchange , which is concluded between the Commission and the associated organs , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Agreement on Human Resource Exchange . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in view of the participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland is part of J@@ ET &apos;s joint venture with the date of entry into force of the present agreement , whose constitution it accepts . &quot;
&quot; moreover , Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland can become a contract partner of any agreement whose objective falls into the framework of the present agreement , excluding association agreements or other similar contracts concluded by Eur@@ atom during the validity period of the present agreement . &quot;
the bodies responsible for carrying out the association provided in Article 2 paragraph 1 of the present agreement are described in Article 5 to 10 of this Agreement and in the Association Agreement .
&quot; the association agreement will , in particular , include the establishment of a steering committee , the competent representative of the Commission and the Bundes@@ rat . &quot;
- to monitor the development of the research work and to ensure that the best possible results are achieved in accordance with the goals of the agreement .
Switzerland is represented by a maximum of two delegates in the connecting group used as part of the Eur@@ atom program - herein@@ after referred to as the &quot; VG . &quot;
&quot; VG , who has to ensure the exchange of information and cooperation in all questions concerning the ongoing or planned programs and activities in the area of the Eur@@ atom program , perc@@ ei@@ ves this task in respect of all research and development activities relating to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it promotes cooperation and coordination between the associated organs and direc@@ ts its T * competence in the interests of both parties to the common objective in the Eur@@ atom programme and in the Swiss program as well as to the common objective set out in Article 1 of the present agreement , with which the scientific and technological developments in the world must be taken into account . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with its Rules of Proced@@ ure , the VG will appoint one or more Swiss representatives to the consulting groups created within the framework of the Eur@@ atom program whenever the competent Swiss authorities are seeking . &quot;
&quot; the consulting groups , which ensure that the funds granted for the Eur@@ atom program provide the best possible scientific results , take this task with respect to all research and development work related to this agreement . &quot;
Switzerland is represented by the director of one of the participating laboratories as part of the Eur@@ atom program .
&quot; the Committee of Directors , who supervised the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program , and who is responsible for ensuring that the capacities of the laboratories , which are involved in the work carried out within the framework of the program , are entitled to this task in respect of all research and development work that falls under the present agreement . &quot;
it provides in particular the best possible use of the staff and for the exchange of the same between the laboratories involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program and the Swiss program .
a Swiss representative is entitled to participate in the meetings of all the Co@@ ordination Committ@@ ees in the framework of the Eur@@ atom Programme .
&quot; the coordination committees , which provide suitable proposals for the best possible use of the resources , the staff and the knowledge and skills of the laboratories involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program , take this task in the respective field with respect to all research and development work that falls under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; the BA@@ F is a member state responsible for the core and energy research of each Member State of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and each associated third country . &quot;
&quot; at the request of the Commission , the BA@@ F advises the Commission with regard to the implementation of the programme and the preparation of the future programmes and the preparation of its total scope , coordination and integration of national activities at Community level in the field of fusion . &quot;
&quot; the opinions of the BA@@ F , the VG , the Board of Directors , the advisory groups and the coordination committees have a consult@@ ative character . &quot;
the opinion of VG on the urgent actions is obligatory ; the same applies to the Committee of Directors in the area of human resources exchange .
the representatives of the two parties cooperate in the work of all technical advisory committees or all administrative bodies that are created for the purposes of the present agreement .
Switzerland &apos;s financial contribution to the Eur@@ atom programme according to this agreement is determined annually by an amount of the proportion of Eur@@ atom &apos;s gross domestic product in the same proportion as the Gross Dom@@ estic Product of Eur@@ atom and Switzerland last year .
&quot; concerning the J@@ ET project , this financial contribution relates to the participation of Eur@@ atom on the joint enterprise as soon as it is established . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Switzerland is transferring an amount to the Joint Venture J@@ ET , which is to be defined in accordance with the provisions of the Stat@@ utes of this Joint Company . &quot;
the financial contribution of the Eur@@ atom to finance the work in the context of the association agreement and the agreement on personnel exchange is calculated on the same basis which is normally used to calculate the Eur@@ atom contributions to finance the works that are carried out on the basis of the corresponding contracts .
the Commission shares the Federal Council at the beginning of the year with the amount required to cover expenses within the Eur@@ atom program for the year concerned .
the Federal Council is paying the commission the amount due to this article as follows : 7 / 12 before 15 January and 5 / 12 before the 15th .
July . the remaining payment mod@@ alities for the financial contributions of Switzerland and Eur@@ atom according to this article are set in An@@ nex III to the present agreement .
&quot; Switzerland takes all necessary measures to allow Eur@@ atom to be exemp@@ ted from duties or other duties and restrictions on the part of the objects financed by Eur@@ atom , which are to be used in Switzerland for activities within the framework of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in this country , acquired or acquired items may neither be sold freely nor free of charge , unless approved by the Federal Council . &quot;
these liber@@ ations are not applicable to ro@@ wers and suffer@@ ers that are paid to these people .
&quot; the provisions governing access to the knowledge provided in Article 2 , paragraph 1 of the present Agreement shall be governed in Article 14 and 15 of this Agreement , in the Association Agreement and in the Agreement on Human Resources . &quot;
the provisions governing access to the knowledge that apply to the participation of Switzerland at the Joint Venture J@@ ET are regulated in Article 14 of this Agreement and in the Stat@@ ute of the Joint Company .
the right of each contracting party to access to the knowledge of the other party is an integral part of this agreement .
&quot; - the exchange of personnel among the participating laboratories in Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and the associated third countries ; &quot;

&quot; in view of the multi@@ lateral trade negotiations and on the request for trade negotiations at its meeting in April 11 and 12 , 1979 , expressed wish to enter into a uniform version of a Convention on Exec@@ ution of Article VII of the General Custom@@ s and Trade Agreement , &quot;
in view of the fact that Article 27 of the Convention on Chan@@ ges has not yet entered into force - I
1 . agree to delete the provision of Article 1 ( 2 b ) i@@ v ) of the Convention ;
&quot; 2 . acknowledge that the application of this Convention for developing countries may be insufficient for five years in accordance with Article 21 Par@@ agra@@ ph 1 , in practice for some developing countries . &quot;
&quot; in such cases , a developing country , the contracting party , may request an extension of this period before the exp@@ iry of the deadline stated in Article 21 Par@@ agra@@ ph 1 , whereby the contracting parties agree on such an application in cases where the development country may provide good reasons ; &quot;

in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine Republic on Trade with H@@ amm@@ el and lamb
&quot; I honor the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations on the establishment of provisions on the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the Common Market Organisation for sheep and goat meat . &quot;
&quot; - Fresh or cooled h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ; &quot;
&quot; as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina are set to the following annual amount : 20,000 tons , expressed in car@@ c@@ ass weight ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Argentina comm@@ its itself to ensure that the quantity of the agreed volume does not exceed the agreed amount and / or is carried out in accordance with conventional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) . &quot;
&quot; should a change in the offer form be made due to changes in technology and commerce , the two parties of this agreement consult each other before the introduction of such a change in the committee mentioned under number 10 to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community uses the protective clause , it comm@@ its itself to ensure that the access to Argentina &apos;s access to the Community market is not affected by this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in the event that imports from Argentina exceed the agreed quantities in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Argentina for the rest of the year . &quot;
the community under@@ takes to limit the exhaus@@ tion on imports of products collected by this agreement to a high rate of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; with the accession of new Member States , the Community in consultation with Argentina changes the quantity determined number 2 according to the extent of Argent@@ ine@@ an trade with every new Member State . &quot;
&quot; the import duties for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Agreement ; here , the ho@@ ech@@ st@@ ment of the exhaus@@ tion mentioned under number 5 will be taken into account . &quot;
&quot; the total amount mentioned under number 2 is determined by the day of the accession of Greece to the community to 23@@ ,000 tons of car@@ c@@ ass weight . &quot;
the community under@@ takes all to avoid market development that could imp@@ air the marketing of Argent@@ ine@@ an h@@ amm@@ el and lamb in the common market within the agreed quantities .
&quot; in particular , the Community makes provisions so that the sales of frozen meat on frozen meat does not under@@ mine the sales of Argent@@ inian h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat due to the implementation of the regulation . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the community agrees that any actual use of reimbur@@ sement or other funding measures for the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb as well as from slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lambs will take place only at prices and conditions that comply with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the community on the world trade with these products . &quot;
&quot; these terms are in a way compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular Article 10 ( 2 ) of the Convention for the interpretation and application of Articles VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the general customs and trade agreement . &quot;
&quot; Argentina , in particular , ensures compliance with this agreement , in particular , that the amount of export lic@@ ences specified in this agreement shall be issued for the products named under number 1 . &quot;
&quot; the community , in its turn , comm@@ its itself to take all necessary precau@@ tions , so that the issu@@ ance of import lic@@ ences for the aforementioned products with origin in Argentina is made dependent on the submission of an export license which is designated by the competent authority designated by the Argent@@ inian government . &quot;
the details of the application of this system are specified in such a way that the position of a deposit must be wai@@ ved for the issu@@ ance of the import license for the goods in question .
&quot; in the case of implementing provisions , the competent Argent@@ ine@@ an authority of the responsible body of the Community in regular intervals informed the quantities for export lic@@ ences ; these data may be de@@ cryp@@ ted according to destination country . &quot;
the Committee shall ensure that the agreement is properly applied and works smoothly .
&quot; he regularly examines the tendency of the h@@ amm@@ el , lamb , and goat &apos;s market of the two parties , and on the world market as well as the sales conditions in these markets , including the conditions which are of importance for the goal mentioned under number 7 . &quot;
&quot; the Committee shall ensure that the proper application of this agreement shall not be affected by the fact that products from H@@ amm@@ el , lamb , and goat meat may not be carried out under the agreement mentioned in the agreement . &quot;
the Committee discusses all questions arising during the implementation of these agreements and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities .
the provisions of this agreement apply without prejudi@@ ce to the rights and obligations of the parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .
the annual amount specified under number 2 is valid for the period from 1 January to 31 December .
&quot; the amount applicable from entry into force of this agreement to 1 January of the following year is set in proportion to the total annual amount , and takes account of the seasonal character of trade . &quot;
this agreement applies to the areas in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied and on the one hand and on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Argentina on the other hand .
&quot; it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; after this date , it remains in force , subject to the right of any party to termin@@ ate it in writing with a period of one year in writing . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the provisions of this agreement shall be reviewed by the two parties before 1 April 1984 with regard to changes which they consider necessary to be deemed necessary . &quot;
I would be grateful if you would like to inform you of the consent of your government .
I honour to confirm the receipt of your current letter with the following wording :

&quot; with an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand about trade with H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat &quot;
&quot; I permit myself to take the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations on the establishment of provisions on the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from New Zealand to the Community in conjunction with the application of the regulation on a common market organization for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat . &quot;
&quot; recognizing the fact that the sheep &apos;s economy and the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat on the world market and especially after the community for the New Zealand economy must be ensured and that the normal sales of New Zealand H@@ amm@@ el and Lamb are not affected in these markets , I honour myself to propose the following agreement : &quot;
&quot; the agreement applies to : - fresh or cooled h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; according to this agreement , New Zealand is ensured for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from access to the market of the Community in the amount specified in the agreement . &quot;
new Zealand receives the assurance that the normal sales of its h@@ amm@@ el and lamb is not affected by the application of the regulation .
&quot; in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , New Zealand comm@@ its itself to ensure that the set @-@ up quantity did not exceed the set quantity . &quot;
the fixed quantities are carried out in conventional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
the community ass@@ ures that New Zealand cannot be prevented from using new technological developments or maintaining its competitive position on the market of the community .
&quot; should a change in the offer form be made due to changes in technology and commerce , the two parties consult each other before the introduction of such a change in the committee mentioned in clause 10 to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community uses the protective clause , it comm@@ its itself to protect the interests of New Zealand arising out of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in the event that imports from New Zealand exceed the agreed quantities , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from this country . &quot;
the community under@@ takes to limit the exhaus@@ tion on imports of products collected by this agreement to a ho@@ ech@@ age rate of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; in the accession of new Member States , the Community in consultation with New Zealand changes the quantities established in clause 2 according to the extent of New Zealand trade with every new Member State . &quot;
&quot; the import duties for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Agreement ; in this case , the ho@@ ech@@ st@@ ment of the exhaus@@ tion stated in clause 5 shall be taken into account . &quot;
the total amount stated in clause 2 is determined by the day of the accession of Greece to the community to 2@@ 45 500 tons of car@@ n@@ age weight .
&quot; the community under@@ takes all to avoid market development , which could imp@@ air the normal he@@ el of New Zealand H@@ amm@@ el and lamb in the common market within the agreed quantities . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the Community makes provisions so that the sales of frozen meat on frozen meat is not under@@ mining due to the implementation of the regulation . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the two parties undertake everything in order to promote the consumption of Schaff@@ r@@ sch in the community with no risk of market stability . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the community agrees that any actual use of reimbur@@ sement or other funding measures for the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb as well as from slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lambs is only at prices and conditions that comply with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the community in world trade with these products . &quot;
&quot; new Zealand guarantees compliance with the quantities mentioned in clause 2 in particular , in particular that there are no export lic@@ ences beyond these amounts . &quot;
&quot; the community , in its turn , comm@@ its itself to take all necessary precau@@ tions , so that the issu@@ ance of import lic@@ ences for the aforementioned products with origin in New Zealand is made dependent on the submission of an export license , which is notified by the competent authority notified by the New Zealand government . &quot;
the details of the application of this system are specified in such a way that the position of a deposit must be wai@@ ved for the issu@@ ance of the import license for the goods in question .
&quot; in the case of implementing provisions , the responsible local authority of the responsible body of the Community in regular intervals informed the quantities for export lic@@ ences ; these data may be de@@ cryp@@ ted according to destination country . &quot;
the Committee shall ensure that the agreement is properly applied and works smoothly .
&quot; the Committee regularly examines the tendency of the h@@ amm@@ el , lamb , and goat &apos;s market of the two contractual parties and on the world market , as well as the sales conditions on these markets , including the conditions set out in clause 7 . &quot;
&quot; the Committee shall ensure that the proper application of the agreement will not be affected by the fact that products from H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat under the agreement are not executed according to the collective agreement . &quot;
&quot; the Committee discusses all questions arising during the implementation of the agreement , which are presented to him by a contracting party , and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities . &quot;
the provisions of this Agreement shall apply without prejudi@@ ce to the rights and obligations of the contracting parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .
&quot; the annual amount specified in clause 2 is valid for the period from January 1 to December 31 , 2011 . the amount stated by the entry into force of this agreement to 1 January of the following year is set in proportion to the total annual amount . &quot;
&quot; this agreement applies to the areas in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and on the one hand as well as for the main area of New Zealand on the other hand . &quot;
&quot; this agreement enters into force on 20 October 1980 . it is valid until 31 March 1984 . after this date , it remains in force , subject to the right of any party to termin@@ ate it with a period of one year . in any case , the provisions of this agreement shall be reviewed by both parties before 1 April 1984 with regard to changes they consider necessary . &quot;
&quot; I am suggest@@ ing that if your government can agree to the standing , that this letter and your reply will form an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand in this area . &quot;
&quot; I honor the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations to establish rules on the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from New Zealand to the Community in conjunction with the application of the regulation on a common market organization for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat . &quot;
the fixed quantities are carried out in conventional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) .

&quot; it is recommended to add the equipment required for in@@ fusion , as well as the solvents for dry preparations . &quot;
human thorou@@ gh@@ bred is taken from a healthy person and mixed with an appropriate anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ant .
&quot; C ) which are not free of diseases transmitted by blood trans@@ fu@@ sions , as far as this can be ensured by simple medical examination and medical history . &quot;
&quot; blood sampling is as@@ ep@@ tic ; the blood is gli@@ ding through a closed , sterile tube system into a sterile bottle , in which the anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ant solution was fu@@ elled before steri@@ li@@ zation . &quot;
&quot; after removal of the blood withdrawal , the bottle is immediately closed and cooled to a temperature of 4 C to 6 C. After this , it may only be opened immediately before using the blood . &quot;
&quot; quantit@@ atively , the anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ant solution may not exceed 220 ml per liter of human thorou@@ gh@@ bred , and the concentrations of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in may not exceed 97 g per liter . &quot;
the blood group according to the A @-@ B @-@ 0 system must be determined in advance by the blood cells and the serum ; the determination of the r@@ h factor is carried out by examining the blood cells at a new sample of the don@@ or blood .
&quot; in so far as there are standardized or recommended procedures for blood group identification in individual countries , they are to be applied . &quot;
&quot; the term R@@ h @-@ negative is only to be used if specific investigations have yiel@@ ded the absence of the anti@@ gens C , D , Du and E . &quot;
the blood exchanged according to this agreement shall only be used for recipients of the corresponding AB @-@ 0 group .
&quot; the human whole blood is stored in sterile , closed bottle protected from micro @-@ organisms and allowed to keep up to its use at a temperature of 4 to 6 C ; higher temperatures are permissible only during the time necessary for testing and transportation , which may be at most 30 minutes , wher@@ eu@@ pon the blood can immediately cool down to 4 to 6 C. &quot;
&quot; a concentration of human red blood cells is a unit of human thorou@@ gh@@ bred blood , from which the largest part of the plasma has been removed . &quot;
it contains all the red blood cells of the unit from which it has been obtained ; other blood cells can be present or may have been partially removed .
the liquid content of the concentrate is either from the rest of the plasma or from a suitable is@@ ot@@ onic artificial wat@@ ery solution that was added after removal of the plasma .
&quot; the volume of red blood cells should be between 65 and 75 % of the total volume of the product ; however , a higher concentration of red blood cells is used , so the approximate percentage of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te volume ( ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cr@@ it ) is indicated on the label . &quot;
&quot; all processes required for the production must be carried out under as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . the filling must be carried out using a sterile , closed system , and only by pressure . &quot;
&quot; an artificial wat@@ ery solution has been added , so it is also possible to specify their volume and composition on the label . &quot;
&quot; the human dry plasma is extracted by drying out the liquid , which is deposited at the top of the centri@@ fu@@ ge or sedi@@ ment of human solid blood . &quot;
human dry plasma is obtained by cold drying or any other method by which a den@@ atur@@ ation of the proteins is avoided .
&quot; the dry product can easily be dissolved in a quantity of water which corresponds to the amount of liquid , from which one went out in the production of the substance . &quot;
&quot; the protein concentration of the solution won &apos;t be less than 45 g per litre , and the solution must not have visible signs of hem@@ oly@@ sis products . &quot;
donations where ( using a fresh sample ) a hazardous content of in@@ soles of in@@ sole or immune @-@ glut@@ in@@ ine has been determined .
&quot; if the plasma is not mixed and frozen within 48 hours after the removal of the blood , the ster@@ ility of each unit must be proven in a blood quantity of at least 10 ml . &quot;
&quot; to eliminate the harmful effects of bacterial growth products in the plasma , blood donations , the signs of a bacterial infection , are not used ; the ster@@ ility of each donation must be proven in a blood quantity of at least 10 ml . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the risk of transmission of I@@ no@@ kul@@ ele , compounds that contain no more than 12 donations or other methods are used , or other methods , which are known to reduce this risk in a similar way . &quot;
&quot; one of the liquid quantity , from which one went out in the production of the plasma , is necessary to add appropriate amount of water ; the substance must be completely dissolved in 10 minutes at 15 to 20 C . &quot;
&quot; a given quantum plasma is dissolved in the amount of water , which corresponds to the amount of liquid produced from it ; the solution is subjected to the following tests : &quot;
&quot; II ) If a sufficient amount of thro@@ mb@@ in or calcium chlori@@ de is necessary , the process can be accelerated in the brood @-@ furnace at 37 C. &quot;

a re@@ agent for blood group identification must react with all blood samples tested which contain the an@@ tigen which is hom@@ olog@@ ous to the antibody or any other substance specified on the label .
&quot; if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) h@@ olo@@ tic properties ; &quot;
the ti@@ ter is measured twice in a suitable medium by repeatedly di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to be investigated .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the strongest serum di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution is calculated excluding the volume of the blood circulation in the total volume .
&quot; in Anti @-@ A , Anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents that are to be used on slides , activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier . &quot;
&quot; the World Health Organization has set standards for Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as in@@ completely anti @-@ D re@@ agents for the blood group identification of international standards , and re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity are elabor@@ ated at present . &quot;
&quot; according to definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group identification of most specific@@ ity is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ sti@@ er , which is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in case of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te floods . &quot;
the ti@@ ter gives the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the final mix within a series in which a micro@@ scopic particle @-@ glut@@ ination occurs .
&quot; the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination , for the International standard prepar@@ ates ( currently Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the ration of the unknown re@@ agent in comparison to the International Standard prepar@@ atory or a state standard preparation in International units ( see Bulletin Board O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 30@@ 1 . ) . &quot;
&quot; if you bring them back to a volume of 1 ml , the Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B S@@ ans contain 256 international units per ml . &quot;
&quot; the preparations are available free of charge from the International Laboratory for Bi@@ ological Standards at the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institut , Copenhagen . &quot;
the following table shows an example of a comparative ti@@ tr@@ ation of the international standard anti @-@ A ( S ) and an &quot; unknown &quot; anti @-@ A re@@ agent ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A2@@ B . &gt; P@@ IC FI@@ LE = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 4@@ 50@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
&quot; if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its properties should be retained for at least one year . &quot;
&quot; the exp@@ ir@@ ation date of a re@@ agent in liquid form , according to label , is at most one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test . &quot;
the exp@@ ir@@ ation date on the label for dry re@@ agents is based on the results of the durability tests ; it is approved by the state supervisory authorities .
&quot; dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is closed so that no moisture can enter . &quot;
a dry re@@ agent may lose at most 0.5 per cent of its weight if it is tested by further drying over phosph@@ oric pent@@ ec@@ es at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg in 24 hours .
&quot; in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent state authority may determine that the agent ( or the solvents supplied with the dry re@@ agents ) can be added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , if the re@@ agent with the added substance continue to fulfill the requirements for specific@@ ity and efficacy . &quot;
sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein nitrogen per ml fluid or recycled serum .
&quot; re@@ agents , regardless of whether in liquid form or after re@@ plen@@ ishment , must be transparent and must not contain sedi@@ ments nor gels or visible particles . &quot;
&quot; the re@@ agents for the international exchange of blood group identification should not be colored arti@@ fici@@ ally as possible , at least until an international agreement reached about a uniform system . &quot;
&quot; re@@ agents for blood group identification should be distributed in such a way and in such quantities that the re@@ agent in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells . &quot;
the amount in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has written records of all stages of production and controls of re@@ agents for blood group identification .
&quot; adequate samples of all re@@ agents have to be kept from the laboratory as long as possible , until some prob@@ abilities can be assumed that the batch is no longer used . &quot;
&quot; re@@ agents used for blood group identification may contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective proportion , the others are the necessary aids to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain the stability of the re@@ agent . &quot;
&quot; for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are divided into three groups according to the origin of their active part . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean that re@@ agents of human origin contain only substances of human origin , or that animal or plant re@@ agents contain no substances of human origin . &quot;
&quot; on each individual container , a black on white printed label is to be attached in English and French containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer , &quot;
&quot; 4 . the amount or , in the case of dried re@@ agents , the amount and composition of the liquid required for re@@ plen@@ ishment , &quot;

the following requirements on the effectiveness of Ser@@ a for the determination of the R@@ h Group may possibly change when International standard preparations are available ( i ) Anti @-@ Rh@@ o ( human ) blood group serum ( human )
anti @-@ D serum is extracted from the blood of one or more people that are immun@@ ised by the an@@ tigen D of the R@@ h system .
&quot; it re@@ acts with human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen D , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the an@@ tigen . &quot;

the Tit@@ er of the anti @-@ C Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; incomplete &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 compared to c@@ c@@ d@@ dee blood cells .
&quot; anti @-@ C Ser@@ a , which are intended for use on slides according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and not contain any form of anti @-@ D ) , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds . &quot;
anti @-@ E serum is extracted from the blood of one or more people that are immun@@ ised by the an@@ tigen E of the R@@ h system .
anti @-@ E Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; incomplete &quot; ) should have a ti@@ ter of at least 1 : 8 versus C@@ c@@ dd@@ E@@ e blood cells .
&quot; anti @-@ E Ser@@ a , intended for use on slides in accordance with the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and must not contain anti @-@ D blood cells ) must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completed within 120 seconds . &quot;
sera of the specific@@ ity anti @-@ D + -@@ C and the specific@@ ity anti @-@ D + -@@ E can be obtained directly from the blood of immun@@ ised persons or can be produced by mixing anti @-@ D with anti @-@ vitamin or anti @-@ vitamin Ser@@ um .
&quot; in a given serum , both antibodies must be effective at the same time under the reaction conditions specified by the manufacturer . &quot;
&quot; if a serum is intended for use on object carriers according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ational time should not be inferior to all types of red blood cells , which show a reaction , not inferior to the proportion@@ ate antibodies . &quot;
anti @-@ A serum is extracted from the blood of animals which can be immun@@ ised by blood cells or specific substances in group A .
&quot; anti @-@ A serum ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells containing A @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups A and AB including sub@@ groups A1 , A2 , A@@ 1@@ B and A2@@ B ; it ag@@ glut@@ inated no human red blood cells that do not contain A @-@ an@@ tigen , that is those of blood groups 0 and B. &quot;
&quot; an anti @-@ A serum is parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted standard of the anti @-@ A blood group serum or a corresponding compar@@ ator , separated with floods of A1 , A2 and A2@@ B red blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ A serum is mixed on an object carrier with a similar amount of 5@@ - to 10 % floo@@ ding of A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A2@@ B blood cells , so ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur during any in@@ undation within the double time required if the same attempt is performed with the re@@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted , standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group serum or a standard preparation of the same avi@@ dity . &quot;
anti @-@ B serum is obtained from the blood of animals which can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or specific substances of the blood group B .
&quot; anti @-@ B Ser@@ um ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells containing B @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups B and AB ; it ag@@ glut@@ ates no human red blood cells that contain no B @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and A . &quot;
&quot; an anti @-@ B serum is , parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted standard of the anti @-@ B blood group serum or a corresponding compar@@ ator , to ti@@ tr@@ ate the group B blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ B serum is mixed on an object carrier with a similar amount of 5@@ - to 10 % in@@ undation of B @-@ blood cells , so ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double time required if the same attempt is performed with the re@@ dissolved but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard of the anti @-@ B blood group ser@@ ums or with a standard preparation of the same avi@@ dity . &quot;
anti @-@ human glob@@ ulin serum for use in blood group ser@@ ology must include ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating antibodies against Ig@@ G Glob@@ ulin and ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating antibodies against complementary factors .
it is extracted from the blood of animals which are immun@@ ised by inj@@ ecting human serum proteins .

the Parties to the agreement signed on 15 December 1950 in Brussels on the establishment of a Council for Cooperation in the Area of Custom@@ s
&quot; it is desirable that on June 14 , 1983 , the International Convention on the Harmon@@ ised System for the designation and encoding of the goods entered into force on 1 January 1988 . &quot;
&quot; in THE weighing , that without a change of Article 13 of the aforementioned Convention , the time of entry into force of the Convention would remain uns@@ af@@ e - &quot;
&quot; in Article 13 of the International Convention on the Harmon@@ ised System for the designation and encoding of the goods , referred to in the following &quot; Con@@ ventions , &quot; paragraph 1 contains the following : &quot;

&quot; B . each state and every customs or economic union , the contracting party of the Convention after the entry into force of this protocol according to paragraph A , is the contracting party of the Convention in the version amended by the protocol . &quot;
&quot; it is a plant which is indispensable not only for the maintenance and maintenance of soils , but also allows the utilization of land that does not allow any other planting , and that even with extensive management that makes up the main part of today &apos;s production , is beneficial to any improvement of cultivation methods , &quot;
&quot; under H@@ IN@@ WE@@ IS DA@@ RA@@ U@@ F , that from its cultivation the existence and standard of living of millions of families depend entirely on the measures to maintain and expand the consumption of olive products in the producer countries themselves and in non @-@ producing consumer countries ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to DA@@ RA@@ U@@ F , olive oil and mes@@ oli@@ ae are essential ingredients in the areas where olive cultivation is common ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to DA@@ RA@@ U@@ F , that the essential feature of olive production is the ir@@ regul@@ arity of harvesting and market supply , and that this leads to fluctuations in production , prices and export revenues as well as to very different producers of producers ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to DA@@ RA@@ U@@ F , this causes all particular difficulties which seriously harm the interests of producers and consumers and end@@ anger the general policy of economic growth in the countries where olive cultivation is common ; &quot;
&quot; the extraordinary importance of the olive production for the economy of numerous countries , especially the olive growing countries in the development of olive growing ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to DA@@ RA@@ U@@ F that , in view of the particular conditions of olive cultivation and the market for olive products , the measures required for the national area go beyond national borders and that international action is indispensable ; &quot;
