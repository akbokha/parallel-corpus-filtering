this document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) explaining how the Committee for Human Use Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
&quot; if you require further information about your disease or treatment , please read the package ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you require further information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendation , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg , and 30 mg tablets , 10 mg , 15 mg , and 30 mg of melt tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution to intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. wir@@ l thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , mi@@ str@@ ust and del@@ usion ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a mental illness in which patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of anor@@ ex@@ ia ) altern@@ ately with periods of normal mood . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe physical episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for quick control of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances when the oral intake of the medicine is not possible .
&quot; in both diseases , the solution can be used for intake or the melting tablets in patients with difficulties preparing the swal@@ lowing of tablets . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are taking other medications at the same time , which are broken down as well as Abi@@ li@@ fy , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; this im@@ pairs the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. , chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells to one another . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l probably acts as a &quot; partial agon@@ ist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ comp@@ ole acts like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but in less dimensions than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters , in order to activate the recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder play a role in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , thereby reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing its recur@@ rence . &quot;
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy to prevent recur@@ rence of symptoms has been studied in three studies over up to a year .
&quot; the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases , which suffered from increased rest@@ lessness , over a period of two hours with a placebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study , Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol for 12 weeks , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo to prevent recur@@ rence , in 160 patients with which the man@@ ic symptoms have already been stabili@@ zed with Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study of 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which suffered from increased un@@ rest , compared with that of Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and placebo over a period of two hours . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , the change in the symptoms of patients was examined using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients responding to the treatment . &quot;
the company also conducted studies to examine how the body absor@@ bs the melt tablets and the solution to intake ( absor@@ bs ) .
&quot; in both studies with the injection solution , patients who received Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , showed a significantly greater reduction in symptoms of increased un@@ rest than the patients receiving placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy reduced man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than placebo in four of the five short @-@ term studies . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy also prevented the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients for up to 74 weeks and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
Abi@@ li@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10 or 15 mg doses were also more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness and were equally effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ pyr@@ amid@@ al disorders ( un@@ controlled strain ) , ur@@ gency ( worsen@@ ing ) , headache , blur@@ red vision , headache , blur@@ red vision , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety . &quot;
&quot; the Human Use Committee ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and from moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in patients who predominantly had man@@ ic episodes , and in which the man@@ ic episodes were addressing the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , out@@ weigh the risks . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the board came to the conclusion that the benefits of the injection solution in rapid control of increased un@@ rest and behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I disorder , if oral therapy is not suitable , out@@ weigh the risks . &quot;
&quot; in June 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceu@@ tical Europe Ltd. for the transfer of Abi@@ li@@ fy within the European Union . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who mainly had man@@ ic episodes and whose man@@ ic episodes responded to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy amounts to 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day , regardless of meals daily . &quot;
&quot; increased efficacy in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose . &quot;
&quot; the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; in consideration of the greater sensitivity of this group of patients , a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors justify this ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zi@@ zo@@ l dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior is part of psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after onset or after change of an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , even when treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no increased risk of su@@ ici@@ dal risk with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , hyper@@ tension , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ak@@ zel@@ eed and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia arising during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; if there are signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia in a patient treated with Abi@@ li@@ fy , this should be considered to reduce the dose or to break the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops signs and symptoms that point to m@@ ns , or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including Abi@@ li@@ fy , must be removed . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in conditions associated with sei@@ zur@@ es . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l had an increased risk of death compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; however , there was in one of these studies , a study of fixed dosage , a significant relationship between dosage and response for un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , including Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
there are no accurate risk estimates for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia related adverse events associated with Abi@@ li@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs to allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; poly@@ di@@ ps , poly@@ ur@@ ia , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored with regard to impaired glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zi@@ zo@@ l on the central nervous system , caution is advised if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective drugs with deri@@ ving side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the resor@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % , while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and that is why similar dose reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabolism , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive metabol@@ isers . &quot;
&quot; if you consider the joint gift of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with Abi@@ li@@ fy , the potential benefits should out@@ weigh potential risks for the patient . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and should therefore be made similar dose reductions . &quot;
&quot; after sett@@ ling the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be increased to the dose height before the start of the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy . &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with Abi@@ li@@ fy can be administered with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
&quot; in clinical trials , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole did not show a significant effect on the metabol@@ ites of the substrates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ in@@ an @-@ ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ zi@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) . &quot;
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
&quot; due to the insufficient data situation for safety in humans and due to the concerns resulting from reproductive studies at the animal , this drug may not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefit justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned against using dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on them . &quot;
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria : common ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , a generally lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS , including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared with patients treated with semi @-@ operated i@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study for 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo . &quot;
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study for 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was 15.@@ 1 % in patients suffering from obesity . &quot;
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I distur@@ b@@ ance - In a controlled study of 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 23.@@ 5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with semi @-@ operated i@@ dol treatment .
&quot; in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment . &quot;
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zi@@ ole and placebo , with potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters , yiel@@ ded no medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; increases of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine phosph@@ ate kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; side effects reported in connection with anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy and the occurrence of treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l include the malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and var@@ ic@@ ose cases , unwanted cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or deliber@@ ate acute over@@ dosage with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg , and without cause of death . &quot;
&quot; although there is no information on the efficacy of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zi@@ zo@@ l , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is useful in the treatment of an over@@ dose since Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has a high plasma binding . &quot;
it is believed that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
&quot; in vitro , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a high aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 receptor and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a and 5@@ HT@@ A receptor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , alpha @-@ 1 adren@@ ergi@@ c and hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor . &quot;
&quot; the Pos@@ it@@ oline emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 receptor lig@@ ands , on the Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and on the put@@ amen . &quot;
&quot; in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a half @-@ oper@@ ni@@ ated study , 52 % of respon@@ der patients attending the study were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ operating dol 73 % ) in both groups . &quot;
&quot; current values from measured scales defined as secondary study goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - Depres@@ sive Rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement compared to semi @-@ oper@@ i@@ als . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a significantly higher return rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole Group and 57 % in placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an oc@@ t@@ zap@@ ine controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients included in significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared with bas@@ eline value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible doses over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed an effective efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study for 3 weeks with fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed no superior efficacy against placebo . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo and active controlled mon@@ otherapy studies for 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a efficacy in week 3 and a conservation effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia in week 12 , such as lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which partially did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum supple@@ mentation , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole yiel@@ ded superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l versus placebo in view of the prevention of a bi@@ polar decline , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; based on in vitro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ lic modelling of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , the N @-@ degeneration is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
the mean removal time is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l with extensive metabol@@ isers via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and about 146 hours in &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ isers via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic between male and female healthy subjects , as well as in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients no gender @-@ dependent effects . &quot;
a pop @-@ up @-@ specific analysis on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics did not reveal any clin@@ ically significant differences in respect to eth@@ ni@@ city or the effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l were similar in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy subjects .
&quot; a single dose study in subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zi@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions to their metabolic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional safety har@@ mac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproduction toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the carcin@@ ogenic potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data had no particular danger for humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions , which clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans , so they have only limited or no importance for clinical use . &quot;
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent side kidney toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10 times the middle Ste@@ ady State Exposition ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose at humans .
&quot; in addition , chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate @-@ con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the G@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , the concentrations found in the human g@@ all at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found in the sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gate of hydro@@ xy@@ - ari@@ pi@@ comp@@ ole no more than 6 % of concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the bile of monkeys , and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of the in vitro sol@@ ubil@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 of the middle Ste@@ ady State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

&quot; 15 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia arising during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
it is believed that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
&quot; 22 In a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l versus placebo in view of the prevention of a bi@@ polar decline , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;

the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets can alternatively take the melt tablets to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior is part of psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders was reported in some cases after onset or after change of an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , even when treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia arising during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; clinical manifestations of m@@ ns are high fever , muscle rigi@@ dity , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or getting pregnant during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects of the drug ( * ) :
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible doses over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed an effective efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks . &quot;

it is believed that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
&quot; in an oc@@ t@@ zap@@ ine controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients included in significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared with bas@@ eline value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; 97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study for 3 weeks with fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed no superior efficacy against placebo . &quot;
the ratio between the geomet@@ rical C@@ MA@@ x mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) in a relative bio@@ availability study .
&quot; 99 Fur@@ ther@@ more , chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate @-@ con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the bile after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 of the middle Ste@@ ady State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution is used for quick control of as@@ gi@@ dity and behavi@@ our@@ al problems in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
&quot; as soon as it is clin@@ ically appropriate , treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution should be terminated and started with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; in order to increase the absorption and minimize the vari@@ ability , an injection into the del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended under circum@@ vention of obes@@ e regions . &quot;
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) can be administered depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the medicines used already for maintenance or acute therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; if a further oral treatment is indicated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , see the summary of the features of the medicine to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets , Abi@@ li@@ fy melt tablets or Abi@@ li@@ fy solution . &quot;
there are no investigations on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution in patients with am@@ ic@@ ity and behavi@@ our@@ al problems caused by schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder .
&quot; if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution , patients should be observed with regard to extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure loss ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
studies on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( either prescribed or illegal ) .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , hyper@@ tension , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ak@@ zel@@ eed and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) . &quot;
&quot; Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia arising during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; clinical manifestations of m@@ ns are high fever , stiff@@ ness , changing consciousness levels and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating , and ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ di@@ ps , poly@@ ur@@ ia , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored with regard to impaired glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the intensity of the Sed@@ ation was greater compared with the according to the sole application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , in a study where healthy volunteers were used in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly ( 15 mg dose ) and the simultaneously Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dosage ) were in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the resor@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant . &quot;
&quot; with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ isers , compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sives , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and should therefore be made similar dose reductions . &quot;
&quot; after sett@@ ling the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be increased to the dose height before the start of the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy . &quot;

&quot; the frequency of adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
107 The following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects in clinical trials ( * ) ( see Section 5.1 ) :
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study for 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients with rheumato@@ id arthritis and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment . &quot;
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zi@@ ole and placebo , with potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters , yiel@@ ded no medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; increases of CP@@ K ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; side effects reported in connection with anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy and the occurrence of treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l include the malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and var@@ ic@@ ose cases , unwanted cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in 110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution was associated with statisti@@ cally significant greater enh@@ ancements of ag@@ gi@@ dity / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and was similar to semi @-@ oper@@ i@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , as well as ag@@ gi@@ bility and behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant stronger improvement in symptoms in relation to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm . &quot;
&quot; mean improvement from the initial value on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score was 5.@@ 8 for placebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ ility , a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the overall population but a statistical significance could be determined based on a reduced number of patients . &quot;
&quot; in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a half @-@ oper@@ ni@@ ated study , 52 % of respon@@ der patients attending the study were similar ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and semi @-@ oper@@ ni@@ ated ( 73 % ) in both groups . &quot;
&quot; current values from measured scales defined as secondary study goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg @-@ Depres@@ sive Rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement compared to semi @-@ oper@@ i@@ als . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) showed a significantly higher decline in the return rate , which was at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and at 57 % under placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an ob@@ liter@@ al @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study goal was &apos; weight gain &apos; , a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg ) with an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which in some cases did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum supple@@ mentation , the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole yiel@@ ded superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study for 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study extension in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l versus placebo in view of the prevention of a bi@@ polar decline , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; in the first 2 hours after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection , the AU@@ C is 90 % greater than the AU@@ C after administration of the same dose as a tablet ; the systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations . &quot;
&quot; in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the mean time was applied to the maximum plasma level at 1 @-@ 3 hours . &quot;
&quot; the administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution was tolerated well by rats and monkeys and in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated administration in systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , the 15@@ - and 5 times above the maximum human@@ istic exposure of 30 mg in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular . &quot;
&quot; in studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity after intraven@@ ous application , there was no safety @-@ related concern after mat@@ ernal exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) above the maximum human@@ oid exposure of 30 mg . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproduction toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the carcin@@ ogenic potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not allow any particular danger to humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions , which exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans ; therefore , they have limited or no importance for clinical use . &quot;
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent side kidney toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to 3 to 10 times the middle steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans .
&quot; in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate @-@ con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the bile after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 times the mean steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

&quot; the effectiveness of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters earlier had received an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine . &quot;
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole gift or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the treatment containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce the side effects ) .
&quot; in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of 2@@ 29 patients with Abra@@ x@@ ane responded to the treatment , compared with 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients receiving conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; if one considers only the patients treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between the drugs in relation to the efficacy indicators such as time to the deterioration of the disease and survival . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel alone . &quot;
it must also not be used in patients who are breast@@ feeding or have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood before the treatment begins .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) noted that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective in patients where the first treatment was not more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel and that it does not have to be given with other medicines to reduce side effects .
&quot; in January 2008 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited for the transfer of Abra@@ x@@ anes across the European Union . &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease and is not indicated for a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy ( see also section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils &lt; 0.@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in the following series .
&quot; in sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy level 3 , treatment should be interrupted until an improvement is reached on grade 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced . &quot;
there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies with patients with impaired kidney function have been carried out and there is currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with impaired ren@@ al function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data about safety and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ article formulation of pac@@ lit@@ axel with much more pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ axel ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
&quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be immediately removed and a symptom@@ atic treatment should be initiated , and the patient must not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; in patients , no renewed abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated until the neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils are increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number is increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l . &quot;
patients with severe liver function disorders ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; while a cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity related to Abra@@ x@@ ane has not been proven , cardiac events in the indicated patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease . &quot;
&quot; if the patient receives nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea in patients after the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane , they can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ etic and con@@ sti@@ tial means . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used for pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age who do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , unless the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ axel is unavoid@@ able . &quot;
women in child@@ bearing age should apply a reliable contrac@@ ep@@ tive method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised to bear no child during and up to six months after the treatment . &quot;
male patients should be advised against a sper@@ ma@@ ker@@ age before treatment because the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( common ) that can affect the per@@ ver@@ ability and ability to operate machinery .
the following are the most common and most important incidents of adverse events that occurred in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the pi@@ vot@@ al phase III study .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most conspic@@ uous ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of the patients ) and was quickly rever@@ sible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 shows the side effects associated with the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy in each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
&quot; very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; occasionally : elevated blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ atine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease : &quot;
&quot; dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , flat@@ ul@@ ence , tongue burning , dry mouth , loose stool , op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , pain in the lower abdom@@ en , sor@@ es in the mouth , oral pain , rec@@ tal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and ur@@ inary tract : &quot;
&quot; pain in the chest wall , weakness of muscles , head@@ aches , chest pains , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in skel@@ etal muscles , chest pains , discomfort in limbs , muscle weakness , very common : &quot;
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite context in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
&quot; since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency are possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events has been established . &quot;
pac@@ lit@@ axel is an initi@@ ating mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules substance that promotes the formation of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tub@@ ular indi@@ ces and stabili@@ zes mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their de@@ hydr@@ ation .
&quot; this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and mit@@ otic cell functions . &quot;
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in con@@ veys the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into the end@@ othel@@ ial cells and in @-@ vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ axel through the end@@ othel@@ ial cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ send@@ ial transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ alb@@ umin@@ ate receptor and a pac@@ lit@@ axel accumulation in the area of the tumor due to the alb@@ umin@@ ous protein SP@@ ARC ( cream protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast carcin@@ oma is supported by data from 106 patients in two single @-@ armed and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ised phase III comparative study .
&quot; in a study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion of more than 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
in the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion for over 30 minutes in 63 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma .
this multi @-@ centric study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received pac@@ lit@@ axel alone every 3 weeks as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with prevention of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medi@@ ation ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
&quot; in the study , 64 % of patients had a reduced general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases . &quot;
&quot; 14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy before , 27 % had only adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ asis and 19 % due to metast@@ asis and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment . &quot;
&quot; 9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression of the disease , as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving &gt; First @-@ Line therapy are explained below . &quot;
&quot; neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to pac@@ lit@@ axel was evaluated by the improvement of a grade for patients , who experienced peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy level 3 at a time during therapy . &quot;
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy for decay to bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and remains unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of the overall pac@@ lit@@ axel after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was measured in clinical studies .
the active ingredient exposition ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml in analog@@ y to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
&quot; 10 After an intraven@@ ous dose of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ axel plasma concentration decreased in a multi@@ phase manner . &quot;
the mean distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 and the high distribution volume indicates a far @-@ reaching extra@@ vascular distribution and / or soft tissue binding of pac@@ lit@@ axel .
in a study with advanced solid tumours the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ axel were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent @-@ containing pac@@ lit@@ axel .
the clearing of pac@@ lit@@ axel was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Gift ( 43 % ) than after a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel injection and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
&quot; in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers , pac@@ lit@@ axel is primarily met@@ aboli@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and to two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ di@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ) . &quot;
&quot; after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ure@@ a was 4 % of the total dose of 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel , which indicates far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al Clear@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; however , only a few data are available over patients at the age of 75 , because only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis . &quot;
chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in the original box and protected from bright light over 8 hours .
pac@@ lit@@ axel is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti@@ carcin@@ ogenic medicine and as well as other potentially toxic substances should be handled with caution when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
using a sterile sy@@ ringe is inj@@ ected slowly over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion fluid into an Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ pier@@ cing bottle .
&quot; after complete en@@ core of the solution , the pier@@ cing bottle should rest at least 5 minutes to ensure good wet@@ ting of the solid material . &quot;
then the pier@@ cing bottle should be swi@@ vel@@ ed slowly and gently for at least 2 minutes and / or inver@@ ted until a complete res@@ us@@ pension of the powder is done .
&quot; if precip@@ itations or so@@ cks are visible , the pier@@ cing bottle has to be re @-@ inver@@ ted gently in order to achieve complete res@@ us@@ pension before the application . &quot;

&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane is used for treating breast carcin@@ oma if other therapies were tried , but not successful , and if you are not eligible for anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapies . &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used : • if you are hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pac@@ lit@@ axel or one of the other components of Abra@@ x@@ ane • if you are breast@@ feeding • if your white blood cells are lower ( starting values for neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ar count of &lt; 1.5 x 109 / l - your doctor will inform you about this )
&quot; caution when using Abra@@ x@@ ane is required : • If you have a impaired kidney function • If you suffer num@@ b@@ ness , ting@@ ling , ting@@ ling sensation , touch sensitivity or muscle weakness - if you suffer from severe liver problems • If you have heart problems &quot;
&quot; if you use Abra@@ x@@ ane with other medicines please inform the doctor if you have used other medicines or used it recently , even if it is not prescription medicine , as they might cause an interaction with Abra@@ x@@ ane . &quot;
women in child@@ bearing age should apply a reliable contrac@@ ep@@ tive method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; furthermore , they should be advised against a sper@@ ma@@ ker@@ age before the treatment , because the Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment offers the possibility of permanent in@@ fertility . &quot;
air@@ ti@@ ghtness and the operation of machines Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( frequently ) that can affect the per@@ spir@@ ation and the ability to operate machinery .
&quot; if you receive other medicines as part of your treatment , you should consult your doctor regarding driving or serving machines . &quot;

please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed adverse events affect you significantly or you notice any side effects that are not specified in this information .
&quot; if it is not used immediately , it can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 8 hours in the refrigerator ( 2 ° C - 8 ° C ) when stored in the box to protect the contents from light . &quot;
&quot; each bottle contains 100 mg of pac@@ lit@@ axel . • After the re@@ constitution , each ml of the suspension contains 5 mg of pac@@ lit@@ axel . • The other component is alb@@ umin@@ ous ( contains sodium , sodium cap@@ r@@ yl@@ ate and N acet@@ yl@@ tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han ( Ph@@ .@@ Eur@@ . ) ) &quot;
precau@@ tions for the preparation and application Pac@@ lit@@ axel is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti@@ carcin@@ ogenic medicine and as with other potentially toxic substances should be maintained when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane caution .
using a sterile sy@@ ringe should be inj@@ ected slowly over a period of 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion fluid into an Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ pier@@ cing bottle .
&quot; after that , swing the water bottle for at least 2 minutes slowly and gently and / or in@@ vert until a complete res@@ us@@ pension of the powder is done . &quot;
&quot; calculate the exact total dose volume of 5 mg / ml suspension for the patient and in@@ ject the corresponding amount of re@@ constituted abra@@ x@@ ane into an empty , sterile PVC in@@ fusion bag type IV . &quot;
par@@ enter@@ al medicines should be subjected to possible particles and dis@@ col@@ oration before applying a visual inspection whenever the solution or the container allow this .
stable uns@@ af@@ e pier@@ cing bottles with Abra@@ x@@ ane are stable up to the date specified on the packaging when the pier@@ cing bottle is stored in the box to protect the contents from light .
&quot; after the first re@@ constitution , the suspension should be filled immediately into an in@@ fusion bag . &quot;
member states must ensure that the owner of the authorisation for the market to market the medical personnel in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail pharmacy with the following information and materials :
&quot; • Training brochure • Sum@@ m@@ ary of the features of the medicine ( specialist information ) , labelling and packaging support . • A clear picture of the correct application of the product acci@@ dentally for transport by patients . &quot;
this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological drug that is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( also called &quot; reference drug &quot; ) .
&quot; it is used in patients with normal blood flow values , where complications may occur in patients with blood trans@@ fusion , if there is no possibility of blood trans@@ fusion , and a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml may occur . &quot;
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated .
&quot; in patients with kidney problems and in patients who wish to make an own blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a vein . &quot;
the injection can also be carried out by the patient or his supervis@@ or if they have received adequate guidance .
&quot; in patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) . &quot;
&quot; the iron levels of all patients are to be controlled before the treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency exists , and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ ine deficiency or by addressing the body &apos;s own ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby reduce the consequences of a loss of blood .
&quot; it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which it em@@ powers to the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; as part of a major study with 4@@ 79 patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems , Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with the reference drug . &quot;
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected to E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o for at least eight weeks before they were either converted to Ab@@ se@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator for the efficacy was the modification of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period between the weeks 25 and 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study where the effects of ab@@ se@@ amed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o were studied in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
&quot; in the study with patients suffering from kidney problems caused an@@ emia , the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values of patients treated to Ab@@ se@@ amed were maintained in the same measure as in those patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; in comparison , the patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the output value of 12,@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , sm@@ elling mig@@ raine head@@ aches and confusion . &quot;
Ab@@ se@@ amed must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other components .
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treatment of kidney problems , as further studies are required to make sure that this does not trigger allergic reactions . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for Ab@@ se@@ amed showed evidence that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the company that produces Ab@@ se@@ amed will provide information packages for medical professionals in all member states , including information on the safety of the medicine . &quot;
&quot; in August 2007 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Medi@@ ce pharmaceuticals P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG for the marketing of Ab@@ se@@ amed in the entire European Union . &quot;

&quot; the treatment should be performed only in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , in case of planned larger surgical procedures that require a large volume of blood for women ; 5 or more units blood in men . &quot;
&quot; for the reduction of foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be used before a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic surgery in adults with no iron deficiency , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications can be expected . &quot;
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml may be applied not to participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation programme .
&quot; the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 - 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pedi@@ atric patients where the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of disease by the physician is required . &quot;
a rise in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
&quot; due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values can occasionally be observed in one patient , or under the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration . &quot;
&quot; given this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month , or if the permanent hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % . &quot;
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose that is required for the control of an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ emia symptoms .
the present clinical results suggest that patients with very low H@@ b ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) possibly need higher maintenance doses than patients with whom initial an@@ emia is less pronounced ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the present clinical results suggest that patients with very low H@@ b ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) possibly need higher maintenance doses than patients with whom initial an@@ emia is less pronounced ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week using an intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should be done in incre@@ ments of at least 4 weeks ) . &quot;
&quot; symptoms of an@@ emia and subsequent symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of disease by the physician is required . &quot;
&quot; given this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose that is required for controlling the symptoms .
&quot; if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value is increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the number of patients with ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the bas@@ eline value , the dose of 150 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week . &quot;
&quot; if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in rose &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l relative to the bas@@ eline value , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week . &quot;
&quot; if after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increased three times a week to ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the number of re@@ tic@@ ence of ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ ence rate of &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the bas@@ eline value , a response to the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be abor@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rite 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood vessels is required , should receive a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg of body weight twice a week before the operative procedure . &quot;
&quot; the iron sub@@ stitution should start as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the start of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation programme , so that large iron reserves are available before the start of the Ab@@ se@@ amed therapy . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once weekly for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before the operative procedure and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be given pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg on 10 consecutive days , on the day of intervention and 4 days immediately thereafter . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rin@@ se the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the medication in the circulation . &quot;
&quot; patients suffering from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ a ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pla@@ sia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive ab@@ se@@ amed or other ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ a ) . &quot;
&quot; cardiac inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke within one month before the treatment , unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses ( e.g. an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lia ) . &quot;
&quot; the use of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in patients who are unable to participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation programme : severe cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease , peripheral arter@@ ial isch@@ emia , vascular disease of the cardi@@ oid or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with recently occurring cardiac inf@@ ar@@ ction or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular event . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ a ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported about the occurrence of an anti @-@ body medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; in patients with sudden loss of action , defined as reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value should be determined and the usual causes of non@@ response ( iron , foli@@ c acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , aluminum oxide , infections or inflammation , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are examined . &quot;
&quot; if the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value , taking into account the an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the rel@@ ap@@ oc@@ yte &quot; index &quot; ) , is lower ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20,000 / micro@@ liter or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row for diagnosis of a PR@@ CA should be weigh@@ ed . &quot;
the data for immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of Ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk for an anti @-@ body induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
&quot; 8 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the recommended upper limit of the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , increased mortality risk and risk for serious cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating active substances ( ESA ) were given with a ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of more than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
controlled clinical trials have shown no significant benefit attributable to the gift of epo@@ et@@ ins when the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is increased through the concentration required to control an@@ a@@ emia symptoms and avoid@@ ance of blood trans@@ fusion .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in increase should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minim@@ ise the risk of increasing blood pressure .
in patients with chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically evi@@ d@@ ent cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive in@@ suffici@@ ency the upper limit of the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy .
&quot; according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
&quot; for tumor patients under chemotherapy , a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa and the ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response should be taken into account for the assessment of the therapy efficiency of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa ( patients who may have to be trans@@ acted ) . &quot;
&quot; if the H@@ b increase is exceeded as 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ emia - dosage adjustment with the aim of keeping the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) . &quot;
&quot; the decision for the application of re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk weighing involving the patient &apos;s involvement , which should also take into account the specific clinical context . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are provided for larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , if possible , before the onset of epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia is examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; patients who undergo a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic surgery should receive adequate thro@@ mb@@ oli proph@@ yla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , especially in case of an underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it cannot be ruled out that an increased risk of postoperative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic / vascular events may be possible for patients with an epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an initial H@@ og@@ lob@@ in value of &gt; 13 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled trials , epo@@ et@@ ins were not proven to improve overall survival in tumor patients with symptom@@ atic an@@ emia or reduce the risk of tumour progression . &quot;
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy when a ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted
&quot; if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood level of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in@@ dose should be adjusted to the increasing ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cr@@ it . &quot;
there are no indications of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F regarding hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation .
&quot; on th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial isch@@ emia , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events ( cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge , cereb@@ ral inf@@ ar@@ ction ) , tran@@ sit@@ ory isch@@ em@@ ic attacks , deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses , ather@@ y thro@@ mb@@ oses , an@@ eur@@ ys@@ ms , retin@@ al@@ thro@@ mb@@ oses and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients under epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
an increased incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ vascular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine treatment .
&quot; regardless of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations to th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications . &quot;
&quot; the genetically engineered epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ si@@ ated and the amino acids and carbohydr@@ ate content are identical to the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , isolated from the urine of native patients . &quot;
&quot; it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells , that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; 3@@ 89 patients with hem@@ o@@ bla@@ st@@ osis ( 2@@ 21 multiple my@@ el@@ oma , 144 non @-@ Ho@@ d@@ g@@ kin@@ - Lymph@@ omas and 24 other hem@@ o@@ bla@@ stom@@ as ) and 3@@ 32 patients with solid tum@@ ors ( 172 breast cancer tum@@ ors , 22 prostate carcin@@ omas , 21 gastro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas and 30 more ) . &quot;
&quot; 1895 patients with solid tumours ( 6@@ 83 breast cancer , 260 bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ oma , 17@@ 4 gy@@ na@@ ecological tumours , 300 gastro@@ intestinal tum@@ ors and 4@@ 78 others ) and 80@@ 2 patients with hem@@ o@@ bla@@ st@@ osis . &quot;
survival and tumour progression were studied in five major controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and the control patients .
&quot; in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin showed consistent an un@@ explained , statisti@@ cally significantly higher mortality than with controls due to various malign@@ ant malign@@ ancies . &quot;
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mb@@ oses and related complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and at checks .
there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lic events in tumor patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these results are transferred to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumor patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of achieving a ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value under 13 g / dl as too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data .
epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ determin@@ ations after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a slightly prolonged half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
&quot; after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than the serum levels , which are achieved after intraven@@ ous injection . &quot;
&quot; there is no cum@@ ulation : the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift , or 24 hours after the last gift . &quot;
( bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic kidney failure in humans and could be due to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
&quot; in a study of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa three years , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; 14 In animal experimental studies with approximately the 20@@ x of the recommended weekly dose , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to decreased flu@@ ent body weight , a delay of the Os@@ si@@ fication and an increase in fet@@ al mortality . &quot;
these reports rely on in vitro findings with cells from human tumor tissue samples that are of uncertain significance for the clinical situation .

&quot; the recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once weekly for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before the operative procedure and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;

&quot; in accordance with the &quot; CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline on Risk Management Systems for Medic@@ inal Products for humane use , &quot; an updated R@@ MP should be provided at the same time with the next updated report on the safety of the drug ( Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report , P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • receiving new information , which could have an impact on the current safety specification ( safety specification ) , the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance plan or the risk reduction measures , after a request by the E@@ MEA &quot;
&quot; • If you have suffered a heart attack or stroke in one month before your treatment , if you suffer from unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time occurring or reinforced chest pain ) , the risk of a drop of blood in the veins ( deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses ) occurs - for example , if such a drop of blood has occurred with you earlier . &quot;
&quot; you suffer from severe circul@@ atory disorders of the heart ( cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial oc@@ clu@@ sive disorder ) , the throat ( vascular disease of the cardi@@ oid ) or the brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) have recently had a heart attack or stroke . &quot;
&quot; during treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , there may be a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood cells within the normal range , which is re@@ forming in further treatment . &quot;
your doctor may conduct regular blood tests to regularly check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
&quot; lack of iron , de@@ composition of red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or foli@@ c acid deficiency should be taken into account and treated with Ab@@ se@@ amed before starting treatment . &quot;
&quot; after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin , ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin was reported about the occurrence of an anti@@ fung@@ al ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ a in mon@@ ate@@ - to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ ia , it will break your treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated . &quot;
therefore Ab@@ se@@ amed must be given through injection into a vein ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are treated for an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value may be the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
&quot; in case of elevated or rising potassium levels , your doctor may consider an inter@@ ruption of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium values are back in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically evident cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or shr@@ ink@@ age by insufficient heart rate , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in level does not exceed a certain amount . &quot;
&quot; according to the present findings , the treatment of ar@@ tery with ab@@ ys@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ gift and the desired effect should be taken into account for the assessment of the effectiveness of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) and adjust your pe@@ aked dose appropriately to minimize the risk of a drop of blood ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic event ) .
&quot; this risk should be weigh@@ ed very carefully over the benefits derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( e.g. a deep ven@@ ous rom@@ bo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bol@@ ism ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are cancer patient , remember that Ab@@ se@@ amed can act as a growth factor for blood cells and may have a negative effect on the tumor . &quot;
&quot; if a major orthop@@ edic surgery is im@@ minent , the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly before the start of the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not receive ab@@ se@@ amed because there is an increased risk of graf@@ ting after surgery . &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medicines or have used it recently even if it is not prescription medicine .
&quot; if you take C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means to supp@@ ress the immune system ) during your treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may susp@@ end certain blood tests to measure the blood level of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; laboratory tests have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are the means to build the immune system , for example in cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) . &quot;
&quot; depending on how your an@@ a@@ emia affects the treatment , the dose may be adjusted for about every four weeks until your condition is under control . &quot;
your doctor may prescri@@ be regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and make sure that the medicine works properly and that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain amount .
&quot; once you are well adjusted , you will receive regular doses of Ab@@ se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , spread over two equally sized inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain amount . &quot;
&quot; depending on how an@@ a@@ emia is addressed to the treatment , the dose may be adjusted for about every four weeks until the condition is under control . &quot;
&quot; to ensure this and to ensure that the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain amount , the doctor will conduct regular blood tests . &quot;
&quot; if necessary to shor@@ ten the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given on 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of surgery and another 4 days after surgery . &quot;
&quot; however , if your doctor considers this appropriate , you can also learn how to sp@@ lash Ab@@ se@@ amed herself under the skin . &quot;
&quot; heart , heart attacks , cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges , stroke , transi@@ ent circulation distur@@ b@@ ance of the brain , deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses , lung em@@ bo@@ li@@ lies , vascular expansion ( an@@ eur@@ ys@@ ms ) , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis of the retina and blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients with ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin @-@ treatment . &quot;

&quot; when a sy@@ ringe has been taken out of the fridge and room temperature has reached ( up to 25 ° C ) , it must be used within 3 days or be dis@@ car@@ ded . &quot;
Ac@@ qui@@ a is used for the treatment of the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones fragile ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
&quot; it is used in patients with a high risk of frac@@ ture ( frac@@ tures ) , including in patients who recently suffered a slight hip frac@@ ture like in the case of the rab@@ id ; • Pa@@ get the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice a day for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or@@ ally or by injection into a muscle before the first in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the use of Ac@@ qui@@ a can reduce the symptoms appearing in the three days after in@@ fusion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of Pa@@ get &apos;s disease , Ac@@ reli@@ a can only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease . &quot;
&quot; as the active ingredient in Ac@@ qui@@ a is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate Ac@@ qui@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the first study included nearly 8@@ ,000 elderly women with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of spinal and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , who recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures was examined over a period of up to five years . &quot;
&quot; in the case of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ qui@@ a was tested in two trials involving 3@@ 57 patients and compared six months with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( a different bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator for the efficacy was , whether the sal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase content in serum ( an enzyme which de@@ compos@@ es bone substance ) norm@@ alized in the blood or decreased at least 75 % compared to the bas@@ eline value . &quot;
&quot; in the study with older women , the risk of verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in comparison with patients under the placebo arm ( with or without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis medication ) with those under placebo , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % . &quot;
&quot; in the study with men and women with hip frac@@ ture , 9 % of patients under Ac@@ qui@@ a had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) . &quot;
most of Ac@@ qui@@ a &apos;s side effects occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less common in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
Ac@@ qui@@ a may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to zinc cit@@ ric acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any other ingredient .
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with acet@@ reli@@ a are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion site and oste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis ( death of bone tissue ) in the jaw . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Ac@@ credi@@ a provides clari@@ fication material for physicians who prescri@@ be acet@@ reli@@ a for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , which contains information about how the medicine is applied , as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor . &quot;
&quot; in April 2005 , the European Commission issued Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited a permit for the transfer of Ac@@ rel@@ a across the European Union . &quot;

&quot; the patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include : • The package fee • contra@@ indication in pregnancy and in nursing women • Re@@ quired of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to resort to medical or nursing care &quot;
&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recently suffered low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg ac@@ last@@ a is recommended once a year .
patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture are recommended to admini@@ ster ac@@ last@@ a two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; for the treatment of the Pa@@ get disease , Ac@@ qui@@ a should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating the Pa@@ get disease . &quot;
&quot; after the treatment of the Pa@@ get with Ac@@ qui@@ a , a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get sufficient intake of calcium , according to twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ rel@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first Ac@@ rel@@ a in@@ fusion . &quot;
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ qui@@ a can be reduced by using par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of Ac@@ qui@@ a .
patients with kidney function disorder ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min Ac@@ qui@@ a is not recommended as limited clinical experience exists for this group of patients .
&quot; elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dosage adjustment is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients . &quot;
children and adolescents Ac@@ rel@@ a are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age because of lack of safety and efficacy .
&quot; Ac@@ qui@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , because only limited clinical experience exists for this patient population . &quot;
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is to be treated with Ac@@ up@@ a by sufficient intake of calcium and vitamin D before starting therapy ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; due to the rapid onset of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ c acid on the bone structure , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia develops , whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of acet@@ a ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient intake of calcium , according to twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ rel@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene , should be considered a dental check with appropriate preventive dental treatment prior to the use of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; for patients who need dental interventions , no data is available if the inter@@ ruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ tomy in the jaw region . &quot;
the clinical evaluation by the treating physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ qui@@ a can be reduced by using par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of Ac@@ qui@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation reported as serious side effects was increased ( 1.3 % ) in patients receiving placebo ( 51 % ) compared to patients receiving placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
&quot; in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between Ac@@ rel@@ a ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) are listed in Table 1 . &quot;
&quot; kidney function disorder Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ c acid was associated with kidney function disorders , which were referred to as decrease of the kidney function ( i.e. an increase in serum cre@@ atine ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure . &quot;
the change in the Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured annually prior to administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a limited ren@@ al function were in a clinical study of oste@@ opor@@ osis in three years comparable to the placebo group and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum into 10 days after administration was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with placebo compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , the transi@@ ent asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium levels , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2,@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , were compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ qui@@ a in a large clinical study compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ qui@@ a in the Pa@@ get trials . &quot;
&quot; in addition , all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis in the study to prevent clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get trials ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recently suffered hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Ac@@ rel@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local responses Accor@@ ding to the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ c acid in a large clinical study , local reactions were reported to the in@@ fusion site , such as redness , swelling and / or pain ( 0.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sis in the or@@ tho@@ don@@ tics area was actually reported , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sis ( primary in the jaw region ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including zinc cit@@ ric acid . &quot;
&quot; many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and most of the reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental interventions . &quot;
7 study of 7.@@ 7@@ 36 patients affected oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose in the jaw area in a patient treated with placebo and placebo .
&quot; in the case of over@@ dose , which leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a compensation can be achieved by offering oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of ac@@ last@@ a 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was indicated in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women between 65 and 89 years old ) with either a BM@@ D ( BM@@ D ) T @-@ Sc@@ ore for the fem@@ oral neck ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing verteb@@ rate frac@@ ture . &quot;
effects on morph@@ ometric tor@@ so frac@@ tures Ac@@ qui@@ a lowered significantly over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
patients aged 75 and older had a reduced risk of verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
&quot; effects on hip frac@@ tures ac@@ last@@ a showed a consistent effect over three years , resulting in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) risk of hip frac@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ qui@@ a increased bone density on lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e , hip and dist@@ al radius compared with placebo treatment significantly at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 % increase in bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the total hip by 6.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % . &quot;
&quot; in the case of 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with Ac@@ rel@@ a ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , one year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ si@@ es from the pel@@ vis . &quot;
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in the tr@@ ab@@ ecular bone volume and the preservation of tr@@ ab@@ ecular bone architecture compared to placebo .
&quot; bone replacement markers The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal Pro@@ pe@@ p@@ tide type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub @-@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients during periods of study . &quot;
&quot; after 12 months , the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Ac@@ qui@@ a reduced significantly by 30 % compared to bas@@ eline value and was kept at 28 % below bas@@ eline value up to 36 months . &quot;
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
&quot; the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion . &quot;
total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with Ac@@ qui@@ a compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
&quot; effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study , in comparison to placebo treatment , the BM@@ D increased the BM@@ D to the overall hip and fem@@ oral neck at all times . &quot;
the treatment led to an increase in BM@@ D by 5.4 % over 24 months compared to placebo treatment and 4.3 % on the fem@@ oral neck .
&quot; clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study , 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ised and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months . &quot;
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in patients treated in ac@@ last@@ a compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
&quot; in another study in men ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , once an annual administration of acet@@ yl@@ a in comparison to the weekly administration of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was not inferior to the percentage change in the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value . &quot;
&quot; clinical effectiveness of the treatment with the Pa@@ get of the bone Ac@@ qui@@ a was examined in patients and patients over the age of 30 with radi@@ ologically confirmed , especially light to moder@@ ately heavy heart Pa@@ get of the bone ( medium serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the 2.@@ 6@@ x to 3.@@ 0@@ fold age @-@ specific upper normal value when receiving into the study ) . &quot;
11 The efficacy of an in@@ fusion of 5 m@@ g. of zinc cit@@ ric acid compared to taking 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once a day during 2 months has been proven in two six @-@ month comparative studies .
&quot; in the combined results , after 6 months a similar decrease in pain strength and pain influence was observed in comparison to the bas@@ eline for Ac@@ qui@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at . &quot;
patients who were classified as respon@@ der at the end of the six month trial were admitted to a follow @-@ up phase .
&quot; of the 143 patients treated with ac@@ last@@ a and the 107 patients treated with the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response at 141 of patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate could be maintained in an average duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after the application . &quot;
&quot; one @-@ off and multiple 5 and 15 minutes continuous in@@ fusion of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 m@@ g. of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ c acid in 64 patients resulted in the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dose @-@ independent . &quot;
&quot; after that , the plasma seal quickly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value . &quot;
&quot; rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic disappearance from the large cycle with half @-@ life cycles t ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ β 1.@@ 87 hours , followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination period t ½ g 146 hours . &quot;
the early stages ( α and β with the above t ½ -@@ values ) presumably represent the rapid resor@@ ption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion via the kidneys .
&quot; in the first 24 hours 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose in urine , while the rest is mainly bon@@ ded to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; the total body clearance is 5.0 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains unaffected by sex , age , race or body weight . &quot;
&quot; an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes resulted in the decrease in Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration at time ) . &quot;
&quot; a reduced clearance of met@@ aboli@@ zed substances by Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely , because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ c acid is not met@@ aboli@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or irre@@ ver@@ sible , substance @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ - &quot;
&quot; specific patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid cor@@ related with the Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance , and was 84 ± 29 ml / min ( 22 to 143 ml / min ) in the 64 patients . &quot;
&quot; from this , a slight ( cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate ren@@ al dysfunction down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ clearing up to 35 ml / min does not require dosage adjustment of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid . &quot;
&quot; since severe kidney function disorder ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) is restricted , no statements are possible for this population . &quot;
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ le@@ thal injection intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight in mice and at rats 0.@@ 6 mg / kg of body weight .
&quot; in the case of studies on dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C are the 6@@ x of the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without ren@@ al influence . &quot;
&quot; sub@@ tropical and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intraven@@ ous use , the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ c acid was determined in rats by 0,@@ 6 mg / kg as a 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals ; in dogs , a 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion was administered at intervals of 2 3 weeks ( a cum@@ ulative dose , corresponding to the multiple of the human @-@ therapeutic exposure , related to the AU@@ C , corresponds ) . &quot;
&quot; long @-@ term studies with repeated use in accumulated ex@@ positions , which exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , performed toxic@@ ological effects in other organs , including gastro@@ intestinal tract and liver , as well as intraven@@ ous injection . &quot;
&quot; the most common findings in studies with repeated use was an increased primary Spon@@ gi@@ osa in the Met@@ ap@@ hy@@ sis of the long bones in animals during the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , a finding that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ absor@@ b@@ tive action of the substance . &quot;
rats were observed with ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity at dos@@ ages starting from 0.2 mg / kg as outer and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such of the skel@@ eton .
&quot; no ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of low serum calcium levels . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not immediately used , the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and the conditions before the application ; normally , 24 h at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded . &quot;

&quot; July 2007 , completed on 29 September 2006 , the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system described in module 1.@@ 8.1 of the regulatory application is in force and works before and while the product is marketed . &quot;
&quot; risk Management Plan The owner of the authorisation for the market is obliged to carry out the studies and additional activities for pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance , which are presented in the Pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance plan of the approved version 00@@ 4 of the risk management plan ( R@@ MP ) in module 1.@@ 8.2 of the authorisation application and all following versions of the R@@ MP approved by the CH@@ MP . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP gui@@ deline for risk management systems for human medicine , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next &quot; Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is known , which could influence the current statements on safety , the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance plan or activities to minim@@ ise the risk . • Wi@@ thin 60 days if an important milestone ( for pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) has been reached . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ c acid is a representative of a substance called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the Pa@@ get &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens formed by and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass which is observed in men . &quot;
&quot; in the Pa@@ get &apos;s mor@@ bus the bone structure becomes too fast , and new bone material is constructed un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ aci@@ a works by restoring bone structure back to normal bone structure , thereby ensuring a normal bone formation and thus rein@@ forces the bone . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with acet@@ one . &quot;
&quot; if you use Ac@@ rel@@ a with other medicines please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines or have used it recently , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
&quot; for your doctor , it is especially important to know if you are taking medicines that are known to harm your kidneys . &quot;
&quot; when using Ac@@ qui@@ a together with food and drink , you are concerned that you will have sufficient liquid in accordance with your doctor &apos;s instructions before and after the treatment with Ac@@ rel@@ a . &quot;
the usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion in a vein .
&quot; if you have recently broken the hips , it is recommended to make the administration of Ac@@ tu@@ a two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
the usual dose is 5 mg administered by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion in a vein .
&quot; because Ac@@ tur@@ a is active for a long time , you may need a further dose only after one year or longer . &quot;
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low in your blood in time after in@@ fusion .
&quot; with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ qui@@ a can work more than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a new treatment . &quot;
&quot; if the administration of Ac@@ qui@@ a has been missed , please contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment . &quot;
&quot; before ending the treatment with Ac@@ qui@@ a Falls , considering the completion of the treatment with Ac@@ qui@@ a , please take your next appointment and discuss this with your doctor . &quot;
&quot; side effects related to the first in@@ fusion occur very frequently ( in more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less common after the ensu@@ ing in@@ fu@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and headache , occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ rel@@ a . &quot;
&quot; currently , it is unclear whether ac@@ last@@ a will cause this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms in itself after you have received Ac@@ qui@@ a . &quot;
&quot; physical signs because of too low calcium concentration in the blood , such as muscle cr@@ amps or ting@@ ling or num@@ b@@ ness , especially in the area around the mouth . &quot;

persistent sor@@ eness and / or not healing wounds in the mouth or jaw were reported especially in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates because of other diseases .
&quot; allergic reactions , including rare cases of respiratory problems , n@@ ettle rash and angi@@ o@@ e@@ dem@@ a ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) , has been reported . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the listed adverse events affect you significantly or you notice any side effects that are not listed in this information . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not directly used , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions up to the application ; normally , 24 h at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded . &quot;
patients with a recently suffered low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture are advised to carry out the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ tu@@ a two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture .
&quot; before and after the administration of Ac@@ qui@@ a , patients have to be sufficiently supplied with fluids . this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to the rapid onset of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ c acid on the bone structure , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ emia develops whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of acet@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , according to at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ rel@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture a starting dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ rel@@ a . &quot;
&quot; if you require further information about your disease or treatment , please read the package ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; in addition , A@@ comp@@ lia is used for a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients , suffering from obesity ( body mass index - BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above and , respectively , which are overweight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and beyond one or more &quot;
&quot; in addition , four studies were carried out in more than 7@@ ,000 patients in which A@@ comp@@ lia was used as a suppor@@ tive agent for smoking . &quot;
the studies on smoking setting showed no uniform results so that the effect of A@@ comp@@ lia was difficult to assess in this area of application .
&quot; the most common adverse events of A@@ comp@@ lia , which were noted during the studies ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) were nausea , and infections of the upper respiratory tissue . &quot;
&quot; it may also not be used in patients suffering from an existing severe depression , or treated with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants , as it may increase the risk of depression and , among other things , cause su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts in a small minority of patients . &quot;
&quot; caution is provided with simultaneous use of A@@ comp@@ lia with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or it@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( medicine against fung@@ al infections ) , k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a means of applying HI@@ V@@ - infection ) , t@@ eli@@ xi@@ my@@ cin or Cl@@ ari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the effectiveness of A@@ comp@@ lia regarding weight reduction in patients with obesity or overweight people
&quot; used in patients who need it for health and not for cosmetic reasons ( by providing education packages for patients and doctors ) , and around the ar@@ z &quot;
&quot; in addition to diet and exercise for the treatment of obesity ( BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or obes@@ e patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) , which also have one or more risk factors such as type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
A@@ comp@@ lia is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of absence of data on efficacy and safety .
&quot; depression or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported in up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts of up to 1 % of patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used in case of depres@@ sive disorders , unless the benefit of treatment in the individual case out@@ weighs the risk ( see section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; also in patients who - in addition to obesity - do not have any apparent risks , depres@@ sive reactions can occur . &quot;
relatives or other nearby persons may point out that it is necessary to monitor the occurrence of such symptoms and seek medical advice immediately if these symptoms occur .
• El@@ der patients The efficacy and safety of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years have not been sufficiently demonstrated .
patients with cardiovascular events ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke ) less than 6 months ago were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant .

&quot; in some , however , not in all cases the beginning of conv@@ ul@@ sions appears to be associated with process @-@ related stress such as dealing with animals . &quot;
&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period prior to the combination ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , so no unwanted effects were observed on the fertility or cycle disorders . &quot;
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was examined at the rat in dos@@ ages of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
&quot; in a study of rats for pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development , an exposure with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and via lac@@ tation caused no changes in learning behavior or memory . &quot;

Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( particularly obes@@ e patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes drug ) is not indicated .
it can be used in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( particularly obes@@ e patients ) who cannot be adequately adjusted using met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest tolerated dose .
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ res@@ a or insulin , the previous dose of sul@@ fon@@ y@@ res@@ ins or insulin can be maintained with the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should reduce the dose of sul@@ fon@@ y@@ res@@ ins or insulin . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s own insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases , making type 2 diabetes better . &quot;
&quot; in more than 1,@@ 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos was studied in triple therapy ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which suggests that the blood sugar levels were lowered when using dos@@ ages of 15 mg , 30 mg , and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the Tri@@ ple@@ therapy trial , the effect of the additional administration of Ac@@ tos for the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ res@@ in was 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional administration of placebo led to a decrease of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study where the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was studied in 28@@ 9 patients , patients receiving Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin showed a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients receiving placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events related to Ac@@ tos were visual disturbances , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ aes@@ th@@ esia ( decreased sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with liver problems , heart failure or di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis , Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients with liver problems , heart failure or di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one level - in the blood ) . &quot;
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not indicated .
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited for the transfer of Ac@@ tos across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , v@@ aul@@ ted and carry on one side the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and is in@@ appropriate for met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; no data is available for pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , so the application is not recommended in this age group . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are endangered by the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. former heart attack or symptom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose step@@ wise . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , weight gain or o@@ e@@ dem@@ a , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , weight gain and o@@ e@@ dem@@ a when pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin . &quot;
cardiovascular Out@@ come study with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ ular disease has been performed .
&quot; in this study , there was an increase in reports of heart failure , which however did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study . &quot;
in patients with increased output liver enz@@ ym@@ phs ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one may not be used .
&quot; if AL@@ T levels are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range , the liver enzyme values are to be checked again as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops symptoms that point to a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , head@@ aches , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enzyme values must be examined . &quot;
the decision whether the treatment of the patient with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one should be continued until the end of the laboratory parameters should be conducted by the clinical evaluation .
&quot; in clinical trials with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven , which can be caused by fat deposits and in some cases associated with fluid retention . &quot;
a minor reduction of mean ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cr@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) appeared under therapy with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on .
similar changes were observed in compare controlled studies with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ ato@@ cr@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cr@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , in patients who receive pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one as oral two or triple combination therapy with a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ res@@ a or as a two @-@ fold combination therapy with insulin , the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the introduction of the treatment with thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ ae , including pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , a occurrence or worsen@@ ing of di@@ ab@@ etic mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a was reported with a decrease in visual acuity . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a , but arran@@ ging doctors should be aware of the possibility of a mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a when patients report about disturbances of visual acuity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be taken into consideration . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of adverse events concerning frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one &quot;
&quot; the estimated frac@@ ture incidence was 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active Study , a study of more than 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5,@@ 1 % ; 1,0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient wishes to be pregnant or she is pregnant , the treatment should be cancelled ( see section 4.6 ) . &quot;
&quot; studies investigating the interactions have shown that pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one does not ex@@ ert any relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or drug dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; interactions with medicines that are met@@ aboli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ inhibit@@ ors are not expected . &quot;
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction in the AU@@ C of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one the hyper@@ insulin sensitivity and increased insulin resistance of the uter@@ us reduce the availability of the metabolic substrates for the fet@@ al growth .
&quot; very frequently &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequent &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , single cases : unknown ( not estimated from present data ) . &quot;
&quot; these lead to a temporary change in the tur@@ g@@ or and the index of the lens , as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic agents . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T asc@@ ents performed beyond three times the upper limit of the standard range as often as placebo , but less often than in comparison groups under Met@@ form@@ ine or Sul@@ fon@@ y@@ res@@ n@@ stoff . &quot;
&quot; in an outcome study in patients with pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ ular disease , the incidence of severe heart failure under pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than under placebo when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one respectively . &quot;
&quot; since its launch , it has rarely been reported about heart failure under pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , but more often when pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; a summary analysis of adverse events concerning bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , controlled , double blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and over 7,@@ 400 patients were conducted in the treated groups . &quot;
&quot; over a period of 3.5 years of Pro@@ Active study , Fra@@ k@@ tures performed in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day for four days , then 180 mg / day for seven days no symptoms appeared . &quot;
&quot; pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one seems to function via activation of specific recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator ) activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) , leading to increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells . &quot;
it could be shown that pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose degradation in case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ gell@@ as mon@@ otherapy was continued for over two years to investigate the time until the therapeutic effect was left ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
&quot; at the time after two years after the treatment , blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) could be maintained by pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of the patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide ) . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled trial for more than 12 months , patients whose blood sugar had been adequately prepared with insulin despite three months of optimization were random@@ ised to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or placebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients under pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % , compared with the patients who continue to receive insulin ; a reduction of insulin dosage in the group treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine quot@@ i@@ ents showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease of alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine quot@@ i@@ ents compared to the initial values . &quot;
&quot; the effect of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , 18 week study of type 2 di@@ abe@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; in most clinical trials comparing to placebo a reduction of the overall plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as slightly , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL@@ - cholesterol levels were observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced total plastic matri@@ ces and free fatty acids in comparison to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or G@@ lic@@ la@@ gens and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol level . &quot;
&quot; compared to placebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in LD@@ L cholesterol was observed under pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , while values decreased among met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ gens . &quot;
&quot; in a study for 20 weeks , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced not only the ch@@ and@@ eliers tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial high tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , which have an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , cardiovascular outcomes , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ ular disease were random@@ ised to receive either pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; after oral application , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is absorbed quickly , with the highest concentrations of imm@@ utable Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in the plasma usually 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV corresponds to the effectiveness of the efficacy of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; in interaction studies , it has been proven that pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ex@@ erts no relevant effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or drug dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 In@@ hibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; after the oral application of radio@@ actively marked pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in humans , the marker was found mainly in rot@@ ting ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the mean plasma elimination of imm@@ utable pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and the total active metabolism is 16 - 23 hours . &quot;
&quot; plasma concentrations of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of oral clearing of the mother substance are similar . &quot;
&quot; in toxic@@ ological studies , mice , rats , dogs and monkeys were consistent after repeated administration of plasma volume magni@@ fication with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ emia and rever@@ sible ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy . &quot;
this is due to the fact that under treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one the hyper@@ insulin sensitivity associated with the gest@@ ation decreases and increased insulin resistance of the uter@@ us and thereby reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for the fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) the rat induc@@ es increased incidence of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( in male and female rats ) and tumours ( in male rats ) of the ureth@@ ra epitheli@@ um .
in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) the treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ ae leads to increased frequency of color@@ ect@@ al tumours .
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the estimated frac@@ ture incidence was 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active Study , a study of more than 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5,@@ 1 % ; 1,0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; in another study , over two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in were examined with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or G@@ lic@@ la@@ gell@@ as respectively . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over 1 year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine quot@@ i@@ ents showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease of alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine quot@@ i@@ ents compared to the initial values . &quot;
&quot; in a study for 20 weeks , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced not only the ch@@ and@@ eliers tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial high tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , which both have an effect on the gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ g@@ liz@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; although the study lack@@ ed the objective of its primary end@@ point , which presented a combination of total mort@@ ality , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery , cor@@ on@@ ary rev@@ as@@ cular@@ isation and rev@@ as@@ cular@@ isation of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that the intake of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one does not involve cardiovascular long @-@ term risks . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; 45 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of adverse events concerning frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients receiving comparative medication , increased incidence of bone frac@@ tures in women was shown . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active Study , a study of more than 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5,@@ 1 % ; 1,0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; in a study for 20 weeks , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced not only the so@@ ggy tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post @-@ den@@ si@@ di@@ ally increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , which both have an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;

&quot; ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane is usually applied once or twice a day , if a quick initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect . &quot;

&quot; Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane has been studied in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , where the pancre@@ as can not produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes where the body is unable to use insulin effectively . &quot;
&quot; in the study , after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror suggest@@ ing that the blood sugar levels were similar to that of another human insulin .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be suscep@@ tible to hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
&quot; in addition , the doses of ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( the complete list is to be found in the package of packaging ) . &quot;
the Human Use Committee ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane were out@@ weigh@@ ed in the treatment of diabetes against the risks .
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission granted authorisation to Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S to transfer ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane to the European Union . &quot;
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice a day if a quick initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
&quot; for example , patients whose blood sugar level has improved significantly by intensi@@ fying insulin therapy can perceive the symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and should be advised accordingly . &quot;
&quot; any change regarding strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( through re@@ combin@@ ant DNA against insulin @-@ animal origin ) may cause a change in the dosage . &quot;
&quot; if dosage adjustment is required when switching to ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary at first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the change@@ over . &quot;
&quot; some patients , with hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin . &quot;
&quot; when travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor as such trips can lead to insulin and meals to be applied or taken at other times . &quot;

this document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) explaining how the Committee for Human Use Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
&quot; the active ingredient in Ac@@ tu@@ p@@ id , insulin human ( r@@ DNA ) , is produced using the method of the so @-@ called re@@ combin@@ ant technology : &quot;

Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
&quot; in addition , the doses of ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar . &quot;
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission issued Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S approval for the transfer of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; when two types of insulin are mixed , first the amount of the rapidly acting insulin must be re@@ ared , then the amount of long acting insulin . &quot;
&quot; if dosage adjustment is required when switching to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the patient , it may be necessary at first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the change@@ over . &quot;
&quot; when travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor as such trips can lead to insulin and meals to be applied or taken at other times . &quot;
&quot; 5 General diseases and complaints at the place of administration Occ@@ a@@ sional - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions at the injection site during insulin therapy can occur local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and hem@@ at@@ oma at the injection site ) . &quot;

&quot; the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum effect is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the whole duration amounts to about 7 to 8 hours . &quot;
children and adolescents The pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) di@@ ab@@ etic children ( aged between 6 and 12 years ) and adol@@ escent ( aged between 13 and 17 years ) .
the data are limited but suggest that the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of children and adolescents is similar to that of adults .
&quot; fusion systems with acet@@ ate in concentrations 0,@@ 05 I.@@ U. / ml - 1.0 I.@@ U. / ml insulin human in in@@ fusion fluids 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de , 5 % D @-@ glucose and 10 % D@@ - Glu@@ cose with 40 m@@ mo@@ l / l potassium chlori@@ de are stable at room temperature for 24 hours . &quot;

&quot; F Use the Flex@@ P@@ en with the injection needle to top and p@@ at a few times with your finger against the cartridge , so that existing air bubbles accumulate in the cartridge at the top . &quot;
the dosage can be corrected both up and down by turning the dosage knob in the appropriate direction until the correct dose is opposite the marking of the dose display .
&quot; aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who already have evidence of crystalline deposits , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in joints ) or g@@ ums ( &quot; &quot; stones &quot; &quot; i.e. larger urine crystals that can lead to joint and bone damage ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ur@@ ic acid level is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day . &quot;
&quot; during the first months of treatment , there are still cases of rheum@@ atism ; therefore , it is recommended that patients take other medicines for the prevention of g@@ out attacks at least during the first six months under treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic . &quot;
the medicine is not recommended for children and for patients who had an organ transplan@@ t since it was not studied for these groups .
&quot; in the first study to which 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared to placebo ( placebo ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol for one year . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day . &quot;
the main indicator for the efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood were below 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
&quot; in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients who took aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of patients receiving 120 mg once a day , had a ur@@ ic acid level of less than 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements . &quot;
&quot; in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 out of 26@@ 8 ) of patients suffering from Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver values . &quot;
&quot; in particular in patients with heart complaints in pre@@ history , there may also be increased risk of certain side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
the Committee for Human Use Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid level in the blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol but could also carry a higher risk of side effects related to the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already led to pri@@ mal deposits ( including an illness known or currently available from the patient &apos;s history and / or arthritis ) .
&quot; if the serum acid level is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase can be taken into consideration at AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe kidney function , efficacy and safety have not been completely investigated ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
children and adolescents Since there is no experience in children and adolescents the application of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group .
&quot; since there are no experiences in organ transplan@@ tation recipients , the application of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compensated heart failure , the treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; as with other har@@ n@@ sow@@ ing medicines , it can come to an acute g@@ out attack during the course of treatment , because of the reduction of serum har@@ n@@ acid , ur@@ ic acid deposits can initially be mobil@@ ised in the tissues . &quot;
&quot; for example , in malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases increases so far that it comes to a storage in the ur@@ inary tract . &quot;
liver disease Dur@@ ing the phase 3 clinical trials a slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of the liver function values were observed in patients treated with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to carry out liver function before beginning of the F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ or and in the further course depending on clinical findings ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in Z@@ was did not conduct any interaction studies at F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O in@@ hibition can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line level ( an in@@ hibition of the metabol@@ isation of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) . &quot;
&quot; in subjects , the simultaneous administration of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and Nap@@ ro@@ xen was 250 mg 2 times a day associated with an increase in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ sta@@ sis ( C@@ MA@@ X 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) . &quot;
in clinical trials the use of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not related to clin@@ ically significant increase in un@@ desirable events .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without requiring a dose adjustment for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the same applied drug .
&quot; in a study involving subjects , 120 m@@ g. of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 1 x had an average 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , indicating a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo . &quot;
&quot; An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of a ant@@ acid , containing magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de , delayed the absorption of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and a decline in the C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but no significant change in the AU@@ C . &quot;
pregnant women data about a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies do not leave on side effects of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
&quot; experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be cau@@ tious when controlling a vehicle , operating machines or exercising dangerous activities until they can be reasonably sure that AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C does not adver@@ sely affect their performance . &quot;
&quot; a numer@@ ically higher incidence of the cardiovascular events reported by the investig@@ ator was observed in the overall f@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ ory in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al connection with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be detected . &quot;
the risk factors determined in these patients were an ather@@ os@@ cl@@ erotic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated heart failure in the medical history .
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects that could be found in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and reported in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups altogether more than once , are listed below . &quot;
diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical trials no severe skin rash or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed . &quot;
&quot; 7 Off@@ ered long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies , 9@@ 06 patients have been treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 3 years long and 53 patients up to 4 years with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
the related events reported during long @-@ term renewal studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported more than once in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ - treatment groups and performed in patients who received F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term renewal studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1.@@ 900 patients years ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported in the pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 for these doses or with a lower frequency :
&quot; diabetes , hyper@@ lip@@ ide@@ mia , in@@ som@@ nia , hypo@@ aes@@ th@@ esia , conspic@@ uous EC@@ G , c@@ ough , short@@ ness of skin , skin lesi@@ ons , skin lesi@@ ons , skin lesi@@ ons , erectile dysfunction , increase in TS@@ H concentration in the blood , decrease in lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ te number , decrease of the number of white blood cells . &quot;
active mechanism of ur@@ ic acid is the final product of the pur@@ in@@ metabolic process in humans and arises as part of the reaction as@@ k@@ ade Hy@@ po@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ ic acid .
&quot; F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is a potent , non @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i value for in vitro @-@ inhibit@@ ing that is located below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar range . &quot;
clinical trial results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) which were conducted with 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three months of serum levels had been given &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 25@@ 8 ) for patients with a serum supple@@ mentation rate at the beginning of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl . &quot;
the AP@@ EX study showed the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conven@@ tionally used doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the conventional dose Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
&quot; patients with serum levels &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 50@@ 9 ) were summ@@ ar@@ ised for analysis . * p &lt; 0,@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0,@@ 001 versus 80 mg &quot;
the reduction of serum levels to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed in the doctor visit in week 2 and maintained permanently throughout the treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x a day ; 10 patients with serum levels &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function En@@ closure The AP@@ EX study evaluated the effectiveness in 40 patients with kidney function restriction ( i.e. h .
&quot; with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients . &quot;
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage of serum acid concentrations in patients regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in group with normal kidney function and 55 % in group with severe kidney function disorders ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of the study ( bas@@ eline ) .
&quot; the data from the Phase 3 open extension study showed that the permanent reduction of serum acid levels was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of patients needed a treatment against a g@@ out surge in the months 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients did not require treatment against a poison ) . &quot;
&quot; this was associated with a reduction in the size of the g@@ out , which resulted in a complete disappearance of the g@@ ums up to 24 % in 54 % of the patients . &quot;
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients receiving long @-@ term treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients receiving Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose @-@ proportion@@ ately . &quot;
&quot; for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , which is greater than the dose @-@ proportional increase . &quot;
&quot; after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ MA@@ X is about 2.8 @-@ 3.3 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage decrease in serum acid concentration was observed as long as this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at &apos;s apparent Ste@@ ady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ranges from 29 to 75 litres per dose of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma binding of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at amounts to about 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary bond to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
&quot; in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ bes showed that these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are mainly formed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id is mainly produced by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; after taking an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose was found in the urine as an unchanged F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine , approximately 45 % of the dose in the chair was found as imm@@ utable F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , A@@ cy@@ l@@ glu@@ cos@@ o@@ id of the drug ( 1 % ) , known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; after taking multiple doses of 80 mg of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild , moderate or severe kidney failure , the C@@ MA@@ x of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at did not change compared to subjects with normal kidney function . &quot;
&quot; the average total AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased by about the 1.8 @-@ fold of 7.5 μ and / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.@@ 2 μ , or ml in the group with severe kidney function . &quot;
&quot; 12 Li@@ ver dysfunction After taking multiple doses of 80 mg of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild ( chil@@ d- u@@ gh classification A ) or moderate ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh classification B ) , the C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and its metabol@@ ites did not significantly change compared to subjects with normal liver function . &quot;
age There were no significant changes with regard to the AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or its metabol@@ ites after taking multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in older patients compared to younger subjects .
&quot; carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , impair@@ ment of fertility In male rats was found a statisti@@ cally significant increase in ur@@ inary bladder tum@@ ors ( transition cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and carcin@@ omas ) only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly dos@@ ed group , in about the 11 @-@ times the exposure in humans . &quot;
these findings are seen as a result of specific pur@@ in@@ met@@ ation and urine composition and considered not relevant to clinical application .
it was found that F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at has no effect on the fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day .
&quot; in high doses , which were about 4 @-@ times of human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred , which accompanied by a reduction in breeding performance and a develop@@ mental delay in the offspring of rats . &quot;
&quot; ter@@ at@@ ological studies in carrying rats with ex@@ positions , approximately the 4.3 @-@ fold and in carrying rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions , which , approximately 13 @-@ times of human therapeutic exposure , have no ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects . &quot;
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without requiring a dose adjustment for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the same applied drug .
diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical trials no severe skin rash or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed . &quot;
&quot; 21 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies , 9@@ 06 patients have been treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 3 years long and 53 patients up to 4 years with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three months of serum levels had been given &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .

&quot; the owner of the approval for the market has to make sure that a pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system as described in version 2.0 module 1.@@ 8.1 of the marketing application is ready before the drug is brought into circulation , and so long is available , as the drug is brought into circulation . &quot;
an updated R@@ MP is to be presented according to CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline on risk management systems for human medicine with the next Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) .
&quot; in addition , an update of the R@@ MP is required • if new information is available , which have an effect on the safety data , the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance plan or risk management activities • within 60 days of reaching important mil@@ estones ( pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) • on request of the E@@ MEA &quot;
&quot; in some people , ur@@ ic acid accum@@ ulates in the blood and can reach concentrations that are so high that ur@@ ic acid is in@@ soluble . &quot;
&quot; if you keep the ur@@ ic acid concentration down by the 1 x daily intake of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , cryst@@ alli@@ zation is prevented and in this way a reduction of the symptoms will be achieved . &quot;
AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C should not be taken if you are hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredient F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or any of the other ingredients of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C .
&quot; inform your doctor before you start taking this medication , • if you have a heart rate or have or at any other heart problem . • If you are suffering from a high ur@@ ic acid concentration in a result of cancer or the Les@@ ch Ny@@ han syndrome ( a rare con@@ genital disease in which too much ur@@ ic acid is in the blood ) are treated . &quot;
&quot; if you have a g@@ out attack at the moment ( sudden onset of severe pain , hyper@@ sensitivity , redness , warmth and joint swelling ) , wait until the g@@ out attack is cleared before starting the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C . &quot;
&quot; this does not have to be with everyone , but could also occur with you , especially during the first weeks of treatment or - when you take AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C . &quot;
your doctor will prescri@@ be you other medicines if necessary to prevent a g@@ out attack or to treat the symptoms associated with it ( such as pain and joint swelling ) .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medicines or have used it recently even if it is not prescription medicine .
&quot; it is particularly important that you inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take medicine , which contains one of the following substances , since interactions with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C may occur and your physician might want to consider necessary measures . • Mer@@ cap@@ top@@ urine ( for the treatment of asthma ) • The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in ( for the treatment of asthma ) • War@@ far@@ in ( for blood th@@ inning at heart disease ) &quot;
no studies on the effects of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C were carried out on the road to transport and the ability to operate machinery .
therefore please take AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C only after consultation with your doctor if you are aware that you suffer from in@@ compatibility to certain sugar@@ s .
&quot; on the back of the bli@@ ster pack the individual week@@ days are printed , so that you can check if you have taken a tablet every day . • The tablets must be swal@@ lowed and can be taken with or without food . &quot;
&quot; if you have in@@ adver@@ t@@ ently taken an over@@ dose , contact your doctor or emergency room at the nearest hospital . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten the intake of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , take it as soon as possible unless the next intake is short . &quot;
&quot; if you break down AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , your ur@@ ic acid concentration can rise again , and your symptoms can wor@@ sen , because new pri@@ mal crystals can form in your joints and kidneys as well as their surroundings . &quot;
&quot; frequent side effects ( more than 1 of 100 therap@@ ists , but less than 1 of 10 therap@@ ists ) : • Over@@ all liver test results • diar@@ rhe@@ a • headache • Skin rash • nausea &quot;

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease where bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
&quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) . &quot;
&quot; to avoid irrit@@ ation of the es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient may not lie down until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; as al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D3 are already used separately from each other in medicines approved in the European Union , the Company recently submitted data from previous studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to prove the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in relation to increasing vitamin D levels .
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low levels of vitamin D in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) than those who received al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company also presented data that suggests that the al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE corresponds exactly to the dose needed to prevent bone loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscle , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as stomach pain , dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , ul@@ cers ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) , tum@@ ul@@ ous abdom@@ en ( blo@@ ating stomach ) , infl@@ amed abdom@@ en ( blo@@ ated stomach ) as well as aci@@ dic kno@@ bs . &quot;
&quot; in patients with possible hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D3 , or any of the other components , AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be applied . &quot;

&quot; capsule @-@ shaped , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; 7@@ 10 &quot; on the other side . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only to be taken with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first food , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day . &quot;
follow these instructions carefully to reduce the risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and related side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
&quot; • AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after the day . • The patients should not ch@@ ew the tablet or take the tablet in the mouth , as there is a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . &quot;
&quot; B. pe@@ p@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract , except p@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y , are given only under special caution ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions such as op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al strokes , were reported in patients under the intake of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( partially these severe and required hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms that may point to possible es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be advised to ab@@ ort the drug in case of symptoms of op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gy , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ fit heart@@ burn , or to get medical advice ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 The risk of severe es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or , after the appearance of symptoms , indicate an es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation . &quot;
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; while in large @-@ scale clinical trials with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate no increased risk was found , rare ( after market launch ) Magen@@ to and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , among them some severe and with complications , reported ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ osis of the jaw , usually associated with tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regi@@ mens contains predominantly intraven@@ ous bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; there is no data available , which indicate whether the removal of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients who need a max@@ illary surgical procedure reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw . &quot;
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician is authorit@@ ative for therapeutic planning in each patient based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
patients should be instructed to take a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE the tablet next morning after they have noticed their failure .
&quot; you should not take two tablets the same day , but take the intake of one tablet per week as originally planned on the scheduled week@@ day . &quot;
other diseases affecting the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be adequately treated before starting therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
&quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral drugs may affect the resor@@ ption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate if they are taken at the same time . &quot;
&quot; therefore , after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific interaction studies were not performed , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken in clinical studies together with a variety of commonly prescribed drugs without clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only intended for the use in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not to be applied during pregnancy or by breast@@ feeding women .
&quot; animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate do not indicate directly harmful effects with regard to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ osis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most of the reports stem from cancer patients , but also in oste@@ opor@@ osis patients . &quot;
&quot; however , absorption of serum calcium to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and serum phosph@@ ats up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred in both groups of treatment with a similar frequency . &quot;
&quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate incidence of an oral over@@ dose may occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia , and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract , such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a . &quot;

&quot; the main effect of 1,@@ 25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ lic vitamin D3 is the increase in the intestinal absorption of calcium and phosph@@ ate , as well as the regulation of calcium and phosph@@ ate , the ren@@ al ex@@ cre@@ tion of calcium and phosph@@ ate , bone formation and bone resor@@ ption . &quot;
&quot; in severe cases , a lack of secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia , weakness of proxim@@ al mus@@ cul@@ ature and oste@@ om@@ al@@ az@@ y can lead to a further increased risk of falls and frac@@ tures in oste@@ opor@@ otic individuals . &quot;

the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture incidence in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were examined in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in the frac@@ ture intervention trial ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .
&quot; in phase III studies , the middle asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 10 mg / day in relation to placebo after 3 years were 8.@@ 8 % on the spine , 5.@@ 9 % at the fem@@ ur and 7.@@ 8 % at the tro@@ chan@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; in the group treated with the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate group , a reduction of 48 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 3.2 % versus placebo 6.2 % ) was achieved in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures compared to placebo . &quot;
in the two @-@ year extension of these studies the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D of spine and tro@@ chan@@ ter continued ; the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur neck and the whole body was maintained .
&quot; fit consisted of two placebo @-@ controlled trials , where al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate daily ( 5 m@@ g. daily over 2 years and then 10 m@@ g. daily continued to be taken over 1 or 2 years ) : &quot;
in this study the daily dose of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the occurrence of at least one new verteb@@ rate correction by 47 % ( al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.@@ 9 % compared to placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
resor@@ ption referring to an intraven@@ ous reference dose was the mean oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women 0.@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after ni@@ gh@@ tly fast and two hours before receiving a standardized breakfast .
the bio@@ availability decreased accordingly to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken half an hour before a standardised breakfast .
&quot; in oste@@ opor@@ osis , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first food or drink of the day . &quot;
&quot; in healthy volunteers , oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times a day for five days ) led to no clin@@ ically meaningful change in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 distribution studies in rats have shown that Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is distributed in soft tissue after intraven@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , but then quickly re@@ distributed in the bones or ex@@ cre@@ ted with urine . &quot;
&quot; ex@@ cre@@ tion After intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , about 50 % of the radio@@ active substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the rot@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; after intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 71 ml / min and systemic clearance exceeded 200 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; in rats , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted via the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys , and therefore it is not assumed that it affects the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines by these transport systems . &quot;

&quot; elimination of radio@@ activity marked vitamin D3 on healthy subjects was the mean ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in urine after 48 hours , 2.4 % , in rot@@ ting after 4 days 4.@@ 9 % . &quot;
&quot; clinical studies indicate that the proportion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not stored in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted via the urine . &quot;
&quot; although no clinical data is available , the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal experiments is also reduced in patients with reduced kidney function . &quot;
&quot; for patients with reduced kidney function , a slightly increased risk of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in bones is expected ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;

&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or to an increased incidence of side effects , including sub@@ - or immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; changes in the formulation or regime should only be performed under close control of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; as a result of switching to an alternative formulation , therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out in order to ensure the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains intact . &quot;
the dosage of Adv@@ ant@@ agra@@ f should be based primarily on the clinical evaluation of rejection and toler@@ ability in the individual case and on blood level determin@@ ations ( see below ) Recommen@@ dations
&quot; after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ ks should be controlled prior to the conversion and over two weeks after conversion . &quot;
&quot; systemic exposure , measured as a tal@@ low level , was comparable to both ni@@ erter and liver transplan@@ ts on day 4 . &quot;
careful and repeated controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ ks are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation under Adv@@ agra@@ ph to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate post @-@ transplan@@ tation phase .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low clear@@ ance , an adaptation of the paragraph can take several days until Ste@@ ady State is reached . &quot;
&quot; if the patient &apos;s condition does not allow oral treatment in the first post @-@ operative phase , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Treatment can be administered intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca . &quot;
&quot; duration of use To supp@@ ress gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy may not be given . &quot;
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ tation proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection The oral advance treatment should start at 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a daily routine in the morning .
&quot; further dose adjustments may be necessary later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of the stabili@@ zation of the patient after the transplan@@ t . &quot;
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ tation proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection The oral advance treatment should begin with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily administration in the morning .
&quot; dosage recommendation - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f must be converted a gra@@ ft receptor of twice daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to a once daily intake of adv@@ agra@@ ph , this conversion has to take place in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the entire daily dose . &quot;
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation After a switch from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to advance once a day the treatment with the recommended oral initial dose recommended in ren@@ al and liver transplan@@ tation for proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection .
&quot; in adults , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day should be taken daily in the morning . &quot;
&quot; other transplan@@ t recipients : although there is no clinical experience with adv@@ ective in l@@ ur@@ - , pancre@@ atic and color@@ ect@@ al transplan@@ ts , pro@@ gra@@ f in transplan@@ ted patients received an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day for transplan@@ ted patients . &quot;
dosage adjustment in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function For maintenance of blood vessels in the targeted area can be a reduction of the dose in patients with severe liver function disorders .
&quot; patients with reduced kidney function Since the ren@@ al function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it can be assumed that dosage adjustment is not required . &quot;
&quot; however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of serum cholesterol level , calculation of the cre@@ atine calculation and monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended . &quot;
change@@ over from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ ant@@ ages When switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ ine to a tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy caution is required ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the dose should be based primarily on the clinical evaluation of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases under the aid of thorou@@ gh@@ bred Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us tal@@ low levels .
&quot; it is recommended to perform frequent checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us tal@@ low levels during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by periodi@@ c checks during maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood testi@@ s should also be controlled after switching from pro@@ gra@@ f to adv@@ ect , dose adjustment , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or at the same time using substances that could change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us whole blood concentrate ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; as Adv@@ agra@@ f is a drug with a low clearance , adjustments of the dose may require several days until the Ste@@ ady State has occurred . &quot;
the data in clinical trials suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the level of seb@@ um in the blood does not exceed 20 n@@ g / ml .
&quot; in clinical practice , the blood level of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the whole blood in the first time after liver transplan@@ tation is usually in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and with kidney and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ ts , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml were usually used . &quot;
&quot; this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects , which may occur in consequence of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us sub@@ - or over@@ exposure . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; changes in the formulation or regime should only be performed under close control of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; 5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be refrac@@ tory to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation are still present . &quot;
&quot; for proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recipients and gra@@ ft recep@@ tions in childhood , no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation is still available . &quot;
&quot; due to possible interactions that may lead to a reduction of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood level and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) , or other herbal remedies during a treatment with Adv@@ agra@@ f should be avoided ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - concentrations in the blood is offered , as the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases under Pro@@ gra@@ f a canal or sep@@ tum hyper@@ tro@@ phy referred to as cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy was to be observed , which can therefore also occur under Adv@@ ant@@ agra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , fluid pressure and e@@ dem@@ a . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , the exposure of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of mal@@ ig@@ ner skin lesi@@ ons due to appropriate clothing or use of a suns@@ creen with a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients who take Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms for PRE@@ S like head@@ aches , changed state of consciousness , conv@@ ul@@ sions and blur@@ red vision should show a radi@@ ological examination ( e.g. . &quot;
&quot; there is special caution in patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary lac@@ tose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ lac@@ tose @-@ mal@@ absorption . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies , known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can influence the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and thus raise or lower the blood values of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - blood levels with simultaneous injection of substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dosage for maintaining the same concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; a strongly distinctive interaction was associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ic such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ol as well as with the Mac@@ ro@@ lid antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies yiel@@ ded that the increase in blood levels mainly results from the increased oral bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us due to the in@@ hibition of the gastro@@ intestinal metabolism .
&quot; highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood . &quot;
&quot; tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us &apos;s metabolism on the metabolism of other medicines tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us with medicines that are met@@ aboli@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect their metabolism . &quot;
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can reduce the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase the level of hormon@@ al exposure , decisions on contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures are particularly cau@@ tious . &quot;
the results of animal experiments have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can potentially reduce the Clear@@ ance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and can pro@@ long its half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of transplan@@ t patients do not indicate that in Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us there is an increased risk of adverse events compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants .
&quot; in uter@@ o exposure , monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for possible adverse effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( in particular with regard to its effect on the kidneys ) . &quot;
&quot; there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ a@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. : &quot;
the side effect profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va is often not exactly determined because of the underlying disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
&quot; in the following the side effects are reported in descending order : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( Frequ@@ ency based on available data not estimated ) . &quot;

&quot; infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases , known as other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , are often increased in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , increasing suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ cot@@ ic , proto@@ zo@@ al ) . &quot;
cases of BK @-@ virus @-@ associated N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ k@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression therapy including therapy with adv@@ ective .
it was reported on ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V @-@ associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tumours in combination with the treatment with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
&quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and high binding to ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins , it can be assumed that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; at the molecular level , the effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us are medi@@ ated by its attachment to a cy@@ tos@@ olic protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the cell nucleus . &quot;
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent in@@ hibition of signal trans@@ duc@@ tions in the T cell and thus prevents tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ kin genes .
&quot; tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us supp@@ resses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of B cells dependent on T @-@ hel@@ per cells , also the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes ( such as Inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , Inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ Inter@@ fer@@ on ) and the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor . &quot;
12 confirmed ra@@ ids were 3@@ 2.6 % within the first 24 weeks ( N = 2@@ 37 ) and 29.@@ 3 % in the Pro@@ gra@@ f Group ( N = 2@@ 34 ) .
&quot; survival rates after 12 months were 8@@ 9.@@ 2 % for Pro@@ gra@@ f and 9@@ 0.8 % for Pro@@ gra@@ f ; in the Adv@@ agra@@ f arm 25 ( 14 women , 11 males ) and Pro@@ gra@@ f arm 24 ( 5 women , 19 men ) were killed . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy and safety of Adv@@ agra@@ f and Pro@@ gra@@ f was compared in combination with My@@ cop@@ hen@@ ol@@ at@@ mo@@ fe@@ til ( MM@@ F ) and cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , at 6@@ 67 de nov@@ o ren@@ al transplan@@ t recipients . &quot;
&quot; patients survival rates after 12 months were 9@@ 6.@@ 9 % for Pro@@ gra@@ f and 97@@ ,5 % for Pro@@ gra@@ f ; in the Adv@@ agra@@ f arm 10 ( 3 women , 7 men ) and in Pro@@ gra@@ f arm 8 ( 3 women , 5 men ) were deaths . &quot;
&quot; efficacy and safety of Pro@@ gra@@ f , C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in and Adv@@ agra@@ f was compared in combination with Basili@@ xi@@ mab antibody production , MM@@ F and cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , in 6@@ 38 de nov@@ o ren@@ al transplan@@ tation recipients . &quot;
&quot; the incidence of treatment failure after 12 months ( defined as death , transplan@@ t loss , biop@@ sy confirmed acute rejection or absence of follow @-@ up data ) was 14.@@ 0 % in the Pro@@ gra@@ f Group ( N = 2@@ 12 ) and 17.@@ 0 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in Group ( N = 2@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; the treatment difference was -@@ 3.0 % ( C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ) ( % -@@ 9.@@ 9 % , 4.0 % &#93; ) for Pro@@ gra@@ f vs C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( % -@@ 8.@@ 9 % , 5.2 % &#93; ) for Pro@@ gra@@ f vs C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ gra@@ f arm , 3 ( men ) , in Pro@@ gra@@ f arm 10 ( 3 women , 7 men ) and in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in arm 6 ( 3 women , 3 men ) were killed . &quot;
&quot; published results of primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the form of twice daily applied Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules after other primary organ transplan@@ ts Pro@@ gra@@ f has developed into a recognized primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant for pancre@@ atic , lung and intestinal gra@@ fts . &quot;
&quot; 175 ill @-@ transplan@@ ted patients , 4@@ 75 patients who underwent pancre@@ atic transplan@@ tation and in 6@@ 30 cases were used as a primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant in 6@@ 30 cases . &quot;
&quot; overall , the safety profile of oral pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies showed the observations in major studies where pro@@ gra@@ f was used for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients . &quot;
an interim analysis of a recent multi @-@ centric study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was reported in more than 110 patients receiving either Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in as part of a 1 : 1 random@@ ization .
&quot; chronic transplan@@ t rejection , bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis ob@@ liter@@ al syndrome , was less common in the first year after transplan@@ tation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; abstract 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , 2@@ 1,7 % of cases were found to develop a bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis of ob@@ liter@@ ans compared to 3@@ 8.0 % in C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases in which C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 0,@@ 02 ) was significantly larger ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) as the number of patients converted from Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases in which there was no acute gra@@ ft rejection was higher after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the regi@@ men of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) . &quot;
in a study the frequency of the formation of a bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis was significantly lower in the patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
a multi@@ center trial with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was performed in 205 patients who underwent a pancre@@ atic and ren@@ al transplan@@ tation following a random@@ ized Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initial dose ( per protocol ) of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached for reaching the desired level of water from 8 to 15 n@@ g / ml on 5 .
&quot; the published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f as the primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after intestinal gra@@ fts showed an updated survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years . &quot;
&quot; early detection methods of Ep@@ stein @-@ Bar@@ r ( EB@@ V ) and CM@@ V infections , bone mar@@ row aug@@ mentation , additional dose of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 @-@ antagon@@ ist D@@ ac@@ li@@ zumab , lower initial doses of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , which lead to tal@@ low levels between 10 and 15 n@@ g / ml and recently transplan@@ ted radiation ( Abu @-@ El@@ mag@@ d et al . , Ann Sur@@ g 2001 ; 2@@ 34 : 40@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; factors such as low ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cr@@ ite value and low protein concentrations , leading to an increase in the un@@ bound Group of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , or a strengthening of metabolism caused by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , should be responsible for the higher Clear@@ ance rates observed after transplan@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; this suggests that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is almost completely met@@ aboli@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby ex@@ cre@@ tion mainly takes place via the bile . &quot;
the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was approximately 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f in stable patients ( once daily ) in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) in relation to the total daily dose .
&quot; it is recommended to perform frequent checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us tal@@ low levels during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by periodi@@ c checks during maintenance therapy . &quot;

the dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether adv@@ ates are used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding during surgical procedures .
&quot; patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor of VI@@ II deficiency , which causes blood coag@@ ulation problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or inner organs . &quot;
&quot; Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but is produced according to a method known as &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which it em@@ powers to the formation of the human coag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II . &quot;
&quot; adv@@ ate is similar to a drug approved in the European Union called &quot; &quot; Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate &quot; , &quot; but it is produced otherwise so that the drug contains no proteins of human or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , among them a study with 53 children under six years , the use of the drug was examined to prevent bleeding and surgical procedures . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , the effectiveness of adv@@ ancements in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood sep@@ tic periods was rated &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; good &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Adv@@ ates ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , headache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ie ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies to factor VI@@ II . &quot;
&quot; supplements may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human coag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or one of the other components . &quot;
&quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Ba@@ x@@ ter AG for the transfer of lawyers in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VI@@ II deficiency , after the place and extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient . &quot;
in the following hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events the factor VI@@ II activity should not fall below the specified plasma level ( in % of the standard or I.@@ E. / dl ) .
&quot; repeat every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer , until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are eliminated . &quot;
repeat every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the danger is over for the patient .
&quot; during the treatment course , an appropriate determination of the factor VI@@ II @-@ plasma is recommended to control the recommended dose and the frequency of inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; individual patients may differ in their reaction to factor VI@@ II , different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ value periods . &quot;
3 proph@@ yla@@ xis for long @-@ term proph@@ yla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VI@@ II per kg of body weight within 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected factor VI@@ II plasma activities are not reached or if the bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , a test must be carried out in order to prove a inhibit@@ or if necessary . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures have to be considered . &quot;
&quot; the dosage speed should be based on the patient &apos;s condition , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies against factor VI@@ II is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
&quot; these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ gen@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VI@@ II directed Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Beth@@ es@@ da as@@ say . &quot;
&quot; the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates to the extent of exposure to the factor VI@@ II , whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure stage is the greatest and depends on genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure time and an am@@ n@@ esia known inhibit@@ or development , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VI@@ II product to another , the recur@@ rence of ( low @-@ ti@@ fer@@ ous ) inhibit@@ ors was observed . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ ophi@@ lia A in women , there are no experiences about the use of factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; the A@@ DR@@ s occurring in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , all of which were treated with previously untreated patients who have a higher risk of inhibit@@ ing inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) . &quot;
&quot; very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( often &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data not estimated ) . &quot;
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated according to the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected drop in the blood coag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II @-@ Spi@@ ech occurred postoperative ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in@@ fusion .
the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the period and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - Mir@@ ror in the plasma as well as the clearance rate showed again sufficient values on the 15th day postoperative day .
&quot; in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) , only one patient showed low inhibit@@ ors with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) was determined by previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or . &quot;
previously untreated patients from an ongoing clinical trial were 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) treated with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II .
&quot; the immune response of patients to traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by examining the antibody ti@@ ter against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects . &quot;
&quot; a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as an ongoing peak of antibody levels against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , otherwise no signs or symptoms indic@@ ted on an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity . &quot;
&quot; in four patients cases of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ ophil@@ es gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes were reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions during the study . &quot;
&quot; 7 As with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E reports about hyper@@ sensitivity reactions of the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ to@@ i@@ der reactions ( frequency not known ) . &quot;
the activated factor VI@@ II acts as a co@@ of@@ actor for the activated factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X from factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E were performed in pre @-@ treated patients with severe or moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( bas@@ eline of factor VI@@ II @-@ activity ≤ 2 % ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters come from a cross @-@ over study with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in 100 previously treated patients equal to or &gt; 10 years and are listed in table 3 below .

&quot; based on the data available since the first approval , the CH@@ MP has maintained the benefit risk reduction as a positive one , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons : &quot;
&quot; therefore , the CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E &apos;s safety profile , which requires a submission of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , to apply for further extension procedures in 5 years . &quot;
&quot; in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited announced the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company will withdraw its application for the transfer of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer . &quot;
&quot; usually , however , breast , brain , bones or soft tissues ( tissue that connects , surrounds and supports other structures in the body ) are affected . &quot;
this is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus , &quot; which has been modified so that it can not produce copies of itself and thus can cause no infections in humans . &quot;
&quot; adv@@ ex@@ in should have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors , enabling cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein again . &quot;
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed from the non @-@ defective p@@ 53 gene in the human body , usually contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be restored . &quot;
&quot; in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein works not properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide . &quot;
&quot; the company presented data from a study with a patient , where Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer occurred in the area of the abdominal , in the bones and in the brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP examined the answers given by the company on the questions asked , there were still some questions un@@ answered . &quot;
based on the review of the initially submitted documents the CH@@ MP will create a list of questions sent to the company on day 120 .
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ore benefits for the patients . &quot;
&quot; the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the medicine . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company had not proven that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be manufactured in a reliable way and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
the company did not inform the CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal will have consequences for patients currently participating in clinical studies or &quot; Com@@ passionate Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; changed drug release &quot; means that the tablets are composed in such a way that one of the effective components is released immediately , and the other slowly releases over a few hours . &quot;
aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever caused by an allergy to pol@@ len induced inflammation of the nas@@ al path@@ ways ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) .
&quot; for adults and adolescents aged 12 and over , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice a day a tablet that is to be taken with a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and be terminated as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cl@@ ung . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicine can be reduced to con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main efficacy measurements were the changes in the severity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients prior to the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study , patients carried their symptoms every 12 hours into a diary and rated with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; in examining all hypo@@ cris@@ y symptoms except con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , patients who took Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared with 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients who took pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was seen , the patients under aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a relief of the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26@@ ,@@ 7 % in the patients who took dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart ch@@ ase ) , di@@ zz@@ iness , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ omot@@ or hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; you may not use Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze for patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or one of the other components , against adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another medicine for the treatment of allergies ) . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ ob@@ ics may not be used in patients who suffer from a bot@@ t@@ angle glaucoma ( elevated intra@@ ocular pressure ) , heart or vascular diseases , hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge ) or have a risk of ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the transfer of aer@@ os@@ ols in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water but is swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without bit@@ ing , breaking or ch@@ ewing ) . &quot;
aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze should not be used for children under 12 years due to the lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms sound .
&quot; it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days , as long @-@ term use of the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine might decrease with time . &quot;
&quot; after the swelling of the mu@@ cous membranes in the upper respiratory passages , the treatment can be continued as mon@@ otherapy if necessary . &quot;
&quot; since Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or or within 2 weeks of termination of such therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ p@@ tin , per@@ go@@ id , hy@@ phen@@ ol , hy@@ phen@@ ol , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , Ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ oline , Nap@@ h@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) . &quot;
safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient collective and the data are not sufficient to pron@@ ounce appropriate dosage recommendations .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ ob@@ ics were not checked in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data are not sufficient to pron@@ ounce appropriate dosage recommendations .
&quot; patients need to be informed that treatment in case of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as , nausea , or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or a strengthening of the headache ) must be removed . &quot;
&quot; patients with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck instruction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours prior to performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , as anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines otherwise prevent or reduce positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions . &quot;
&quot; in the course of clinical trials with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were administered in addition , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed . &quot;
&quot; the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and the patients treated with placebo , regardless of whether lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was taken alone or with alcohol . &quot;
the enzyme responsible for metabolism of the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
&quot; in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 not inhi@@ bit dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and is neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins . &quot;
&quot; the harm@@ lessness of the use of aer@@ ob@@ ics during pregnancy is not assured , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies , however , do not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population . &quot;
&quot; since reproductive studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans , and because of the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze should not be used during pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to a ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness which can lead to impair@@ ment of transport capability or the ability to operate machinery . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , zy@@ an@@ ose , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible Latvian actions . &quot;
&quot; headache , anxiety , start@@ ling Mik@@ tion , muscle weakness , and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory in@@ suffici@@ ency , heart rhythm disorders , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thirst , per@@ spir@@ ation , ap@@ ax@@ ia , vision disturbances and hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ onia . &quot;
&quot; CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ drying , pup@@ illary stiff@@ ness and - di@@ lat@@ ation , redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include both the in@@ hibition of release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesion molecules P @-@ sel@@ tin to end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , the Dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance , including the strengthening of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg a daily rate of sleep@@ iness was observed in comparison to placebo . &quot;
&quot; oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can indu@@ ce further sympath@@ om@@ im@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestations of CN@@ S arous@@ al . &quot;
&quot; 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 were involved with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the hist@@ amine @-@ antagon@@ istic efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; in view of gender , age or ethnic affili@@ ation , the effectiveness of aero@@ bic tablets did not show significant differences . &quot;
&quot; as part of a single dose study on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes of the administration of the plasma . &quot;
&quot; after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze in healthy subjects over 14 days , the flow equilibrium of the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 . &quot;
&quot; as part of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multiple @-@ dose study carried out with the formulation as a tablet on healthy adult subjects , four subjects of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were poorly metabol@@ ised . &quot;
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the sole administration of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was bio@@ equivalent to the exposure to an aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not reveal any particular danger to humans . &quot;
&quot; the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the effects observed were generally related to the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine . &quot;
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n / pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ at@@ ogenic in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
&quot; in March 2007 , the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system described in Module 1.@@ 8.1 is established and works before and while the product is on the market . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to reli@@ eving the allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s substance , can un@@ fold its effect . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablets allevi@@ ate symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever ) , such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ chy nose and tear@@ ing or it@@ chy eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating the nose . &quot;
&quot; 20 In certain circumstances , you may be particularly sensitive to the mu@@ cous membrane which is s@@ wollen with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , which is contained in this drug . &quot;

&quot; inform your doctor if the following symptoms or diseases occur or are diagnosed under the use of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze : • hyper@@ tension • heart ch@@ asing , heart pal@@ pit@@ ations • heart rhythm disorders • nausea and head@@ aches or a strengthening of existing head@@ aches . &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have taken it recently even if it is not prescription medicine .
&quot; when using the recommended dosage , it is not to be expected that aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze leads to di@@ zz@@ iness or reduces the attention . &quot;
if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should check immediately your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should .
&quot; if you forgot to take a dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze if you forgot to take a dose in time , take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the scheduled time . &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed adverse events affect you significantly or you notice any side effects that are not specified in this information .
&quot; heart ch@@ asing , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , mouth @-@ drying , di@@ zz@@ iness , sore throat , loss of appetite , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , sugar in the urine , increased blood sugar levels , thirst , fatigue , headache , sleep disorders , nerv@@ ousness and di@@ zz@@ iness . &quot;

&quot; after the launch of the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was reported very rarely about cases of severe allergic reactions ( breathing difficulties , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , n@@ ettle rash and swelling ) or skin rash . &quot;
&quot; cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ asing , abdominal pain , nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , diar@@ rhe@@ a , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , drow@@ sin@@ ess , sleep disorders , muscular pains , sei@@ zur@@ es , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , cases of liver inflammation and cases of conspic@@ uous liver values were also very rarely reported . &quot;
&quot; it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 m@@ g@@ - ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ ate for intake ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution for intake . &quot;
&quot; for children aged 1 to 5 years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , which is in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup . &quot;
&quot; for children between six and eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or sy@@ rup . &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in eight studies involving about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies of patients who also had asthma ) .
&quot; efficacy was measured by as@@ cer@@ taining the change of symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the squares , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance on the day ) before and after six weeks treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies have been presented to prove that the body utili@@ zes sy@@ rup , the solution to intake and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is safe . &quot;
&quot; in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , if the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us increased by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies at Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decrease in the symptom rate after six weeks was compared with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared with 40 and 33 % in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the transfer of A@@ eri@@ us throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; one tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the use of disasters in adolescents aged 12 to 17 ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the previous disease progression and can be terminated after the symptoms of the symptoms and can be resum@@ ed upon their re@@ occurring .
the per@@ si@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during the allergy period .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not established as part of clinical studies with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets when ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were administered in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to di@@ zz@@ iness , which can lead to impair@@ ment of transport capability or the ability to operate machinery . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us at the recommended dose of 5 mg , compared to those treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most frequently reported adverse events reported more frequently than placebo reported fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , mouth @-@ drying ( 0.8 % ) and headache ( 0.@@ 6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect was head@@ aches , which occurred at 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and in 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study involving up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) .
&quot; this includes both the in@@ hibition of release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesion molecules P @-@ sel@@ tin to end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical study with multiple doses of up to 20 mg daily in a dose of up to 20 mg daily .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine @-@ times of the clinical dose ) over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was observed . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , the Dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance , including the strengthening of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nose secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tears of tears , and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may alternatively be classified in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and per@@ si@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s depending on the duration of the symptoms . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s are defined as occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s are defined as symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
&quot; as was shown on the basis of the overall study of quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; chronic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria was sub@@ stituted for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , since the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology is similar to different forms and chronic patients can be easily pro@@ spec@@ tively recru@@ ited . &quot;
&quot; since hist@@ amine infection is a caus@@ ative factor in all ur@@ tic@@ aria diseases , chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria is expected to improve symptoms even in other forms of the Ur@@ tic@@ aria . this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled trials for 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not respond to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka was excluded from the study . &quot;
improvement of it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us significantly reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and wak@@ efulness , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which patients &apos; demo@@ graphics were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of patients reached a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after once daily use of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for metabolism of the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded . &quot;
&quot; in vi@@ vo , not C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and is neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , low @-@ cal@@ orie breakfast ) did not affect the availability of the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies performed with the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , in a comparable degree of the exposure of the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional safety har@@ mac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity in repeated dose , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not reveal any particular danger to humans . &quot;
&quot; color@@ less film ( contains lac@@ tose mon@@ ohydr@@ ate , hypo@@ c@@ ite , titanium dioxide , Mac@@ ro@@ go@@ l 400 , Indi@@ go car@@ min ( E 132 ) ) , colour@@ less film ( contains hypo@@ c@@ ite , mac@@ ro@@ go@@ l 400 ) , car@@ nau@@ ba wax , ble@@ ached wax . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals , to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that there is no data available to support a treatment of infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ic anom@@ ali@@ es , the diagnosis of an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in diagnosis . &quot;
&quot; about 6 % of adults and children from 2 to 11 years of age met@@ aboli@@ ze des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , and experience higher substance exposure ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , which is met@@ aboli@@ zed , is identical to that of children who metabol@@ ise normally . &quot;
&quot; this medicine contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ lac@@ tose @-@ absorption or su@@ re@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine should not be taken . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not established with A@@ eri@@ us tablets during clinical studies where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were administered in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group as in the placebo group .
&quot; in clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than those treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
children aged 1 to 11 years who were eligible for an anti @-@ hist@@ amine therapy received a daily dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
&quot; because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population . &quot;
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents in which a dose of up to 20 mg per day was applied .
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in which dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used daily in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine @-@ times of the clinical dose ) over ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was observed . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness was observed in comparison to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a single @-@ day dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials do not have any impair@@ ment of the psych@@ omot@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous intake of alcohol was neither an increase in alcohol @-@ induced performance of performance nor an increase in drow@@ sin@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; in adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nose secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tears of tears , and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; as shown on the basis of the overall study of quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled trials for 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this limited met@@ aboli@@ zing phen@@ otype was similar in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ sian people ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with the sy@@ rup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s that met@@ aboli@@ ze .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ X was about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ life of approximately 120 hours .
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant drug @-@ related distress after once daily use of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 different single dose studies showed that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x levels of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pedi@@ atric patients were comparable with those of adults who received the dis@@ sem@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for metabolism of the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup is offered in type III bra@@ in@@ glass bottles with child @-@ safe polypropylene inter@@ connection cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml . &quot;
&quot; equipped with a rigid , transparent polystyrene measuring spoon , calibr@@ ated at 2.5 ml and 5 ml or with an application sy@@ ringe for preparations for intake with sc@@ aling of 2.5 ml and 5 ml ( only for the 150 ml bottle ) . &quot;
&quot; take a dose of A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at for intake once a day , to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the ly@@ ophi@@ li@@ ate must be removed without damaging it . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not established with A@@ eri@@ us tablets during clinical studies where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were additionally used ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets a day compared to patients treated with placebo . &quot;
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study where up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) were applied .
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at was well tolerated in two single dose studies ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data . &quot;
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical study with multiple doses of up to 20 mg daily in a dose of up to 20 mg daily .
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , which was applied in a dose of 45 mg a day in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) over a period of ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was observed . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg a daily rate of sleep@@ iness was observed in comparison to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a 17 single dose study with adults , the Dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters , including the strengthening of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nose secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tears of tears , and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; as was shown on the basis of the overall study of quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; 18 In a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which the patients &apos; demo@@ graphics were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of patients reached a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;

&quot; two A@@ eri@@ us 2,5 m@@ g. of melt tablets once daily put into the mouth to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the use of disasters in adolescents aged 12 to 17 ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
&quot; immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the melt tablet is removed without damaging it . &quot;
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg melt tablets in the treatment of children under the age of 6 have not been proven until now .
the overall frequency of adverse events between the dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and the placebo group was equal and did not decrease significantly from the safety profile identified in adult patients .
&quot; at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us melt tablet proved to be a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of Ly@@ on@@ is@@ at as a classification of disti@@ but@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; in the course of a clinical study with multiple doses , in which the drug was applied in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , the Dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance , including the strengthening of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this badly met@@ aboli@@ zing phen@@ otype was similar to adult ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and under black ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) , but the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population . &quot;
in single dose crossover studies by A@@ eri@@ us melt tablet with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at for intake the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent .
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us 2,5 mg tablets were not studied in pedi@@ atric patients , but in conjunction with the dose @-@ finding studies in children the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melt tablets support the use of the 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years . &quot;

&quot; at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg melt tablet proved to be a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of Ly@@ on@@ is@@ at as a removable formulation of disti@@ but@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical study with multiple doses of up to 20 mg daily in a dose of up to 20 mg daily .
&quot; in a 30 single dose study with adults , the Dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters , including the strengthening of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nose secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tears of tears , and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
in single dose crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg melt tablet with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ on@@ is@@ at for intake the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent .
the total analysis of prec@@ lin@@ ical and clinical irrit@@ ation tests for the melt tablet revealed that this formulation is an unlikely risk of local irrit@@ ation in clinical application .
the safety of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in children between 2 and 11 years which met@@ aboli@@ ze severely is identical to that of children who metabol@@ ise normally .
&quot; this medicine contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ re@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine should not be taken . &quot;
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the placebo group .
&quot; infants between 6 and 23 months were the most frequently reported adverse events reported more frequently than placebo , diar@@ rhe@@ a ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2,3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ( 2,3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in an additional study , a one @-@ time dose of 2.5 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n solution for taking no side effects in patients between 6 and 11 years was observed . &quot;
&quot; in the recommended doses , the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see section 5.2 ) were similar in children &apos;s and adult population . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness was observed in comparison to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may alternatively be used in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s depending on the duration of the symptoms alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; as was shown on the basis of the overall study of quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this limited met@@ aboli@@ zing phen@@ otype was similar in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ sian people ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
&quot; since A@@ eri@@ us contains the same concentration of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , no organic equivalent study was needed and it is expected that it corresponds to the sy@@ rup and the tablets . &quot;
&quot; in different single dose studies , Pedi@@ atric and C@@ MA@@ x levels of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pedi@@ atric patients were similar to those of adults who received the dis@@ sem@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg . &quot;

&quot; in June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. granted the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company will withdraw its application for the transfer of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov for the prevention of the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influenza in adults and elderly people . &quot;
&quot; A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people for protection against influenza , caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influenza A virus . &quot;
this is a special type of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus appears that can easily spread from man to person because humans have not yet built immunity ( no protection ) against it .
&quot; after the vaccine is administered , the immune system detects the parts of the flu virus as &quot; foreign &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the immune system will later be able to form antibodies in contact with a flu virus of this ancest@@ or . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , the membrane of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which the human body recognizes as a foreign body ) , was cleaned up and used as a component of the vaccine . &quot;
&quot; inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with &quot; &quot; good clinical practice &quot; &quot; ( G@@ CP ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the extent of the clinical data base did not suff@@ ice to assess the safety of the vaccine , in order to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; should you take part in a clinical trial and require further information about your treatment , please contact your attending physician . &quot;
&quot; if you require further information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendation , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines to treat adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who cannot swallow the capsules , A@@ gener@@ a is available as a solution to intake , but it cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r since the safety of this combination has not been studied . &quot;
&quot; arom@@ a@@ therapy should only be classified , if the doctor has examined which anti@@ viral drugs the patient has previously taken , and the likel@@ ihood of the virus to be addressed to the medicine . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , taken together with 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral drugs twice a day . &quot;
&quot; in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of a@@ gener@@ a depends on body weight . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , A@@ gener@@ a reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps it at a low level . &quot;
&quot; not to cure AIDS , however , can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS . &quot;
&quot; as@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; it was compared to other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults , formerly used in prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who used prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change in viral load after treatment .
&quot; in the studies with patients who had previously taken no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , more patients had a viral load of less than 400 copies / m@@ l. after 48 weeks compared to placebo , but A@@ gener@@ a was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children , A@@ gener@@ a also reduced the viral load , but only very few of the children who had been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were very few . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the use of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased the viral load after 16 weeks treatment as well as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , her@@ on@@ avi@@ r combined with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger drop in viral load after four weeks compared to patients receiving their former prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of a@@ gener@@ a ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , nausea , vom@@ iting , skin rash and fatigue ( fatigue ) . &quot;
2 / 3 asis may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ on@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components .
&quot; arom@@ a@@ therapy may not be used in patients , St. John &apos;s wort ( herbal supplement for treating depression ) or medicines that are degra@@ ded just as a@@ gener@@ a and are harmful in high concentrations in the blood . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines for HIV , patients who take a@@ gener@@ a are the risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( death of bone tissue ) or an immune re@@ activation syndrome ( symptoms of infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of a@@ gener@@ a in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors over four years compared to the risks .
&quot; as@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee noted that the benefit of a@@ gener@@ a in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously did not have prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors is not proven . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ a was originally approved under &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; , &quot; since only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot;
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited for the transfer of as@@ gener@@ ase within the European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ a is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards . &quot;
&quot; usually , am@@ generative capsules should be given to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ ster of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the use of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r should be carried out taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , a@@ generic capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for a@@ generic capsules is 600 mg of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; 2 If as@@ ec@@ ase capsules are used without the rein@@ forcing additive of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sters ) , higher doses of a@@ gener@@ a ( 1200 mg twice a day ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for a@@ generic capsules is 20 mg of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 24@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not examined in children . &quot;
&quot; arom@@ a@@ therapy is not recommended for use in children under the age of 4 , due to the lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of a@@ generic capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice a day in adult patients with moderate liver function disorder at 450 mg twice daily , and in patients with severe liver function disorders at 300 mg twice a day . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application should be performed with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; arom@@ a@@ therapy must not be given at the same time with medicines that have a small therapeutic breadth , and also represent the substrates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of am@@ sprin@@ avi@@ r during the use of am@@ sprin@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that as@@ gener@@ a or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with a@@ gener@@ a does not prevent the risk of transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; usually , A@@ gener@@ a capsules should be used together with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal outcome .
&quot; in case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information on this medicine . &quot;
&quot; patients with a pre @-@ existing h@@ ep@@ atic function , including chronic @-@ active hepatitis , show an increased frequency of liver function disorders under anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored in line with clinical practice . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous use of a@@ gener@@ a and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ oids , which are metabol@@ ised via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including C@@ ushing and supp@@ ress@@ ors of the adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , simultaneous administration of a@@ gener@@ a with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of My@@ opath@@ ies including rh@@ einf@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; 4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ulated R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available . &quot;
patients who take this medicine at the same time can be less effective due to the reduced plasma level of am@@ sprin@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be altered , but the information is insufficient to assess the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored for respiratory symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the possible risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ col@@ ge@@ al content of the A@@ gener@@ el solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under the age of four and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ a should be ab@@ used in duration 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were reported on the presence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , or an ex@@ as@@ pi@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . &quot;
many of the patients had other diseases to which therapy medications were needed which are associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
&quot; higher age , and associated with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; in hem@@ ophi@@ le patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase of bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ or@@ rho@@ ids are reported . &quot;
&quot; in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections leading to severe clinical conditions or worsen@@ ing of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although multi@@ fac@@ torial e@@ ology is adopted ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 medi@@ ums with low therapeu@@ tical width A@@ gener@@ a must not be given at the same time with medicines that have a small therapeutic breadth and also represent substrates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrates with low therapeutic width a@@ gener@@ ase with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be combined with medicines that are metabol@@ ised mainly via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects for increased plasma levels .
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in is an 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development . &quot;
&quot; in trying to equ@@ alize the degra@@ ded plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , adverse reactions were observed at the liver . &quot;
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
&quot; if a patient already absor@@ bs St. John &apos;s wort , the am@@ on@@ avi@@ r@@ ors and , if possible , check the viral load and susp@@ end St. John &apos;s wort . &quot;
dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not necessary if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is given together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
&quot; if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) is administered in combination with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) , C@@ MA@@ X is reduced by 30 % . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , dos@@ ages of 600 mg of am@@ sprin@@ avi@@ r were used twice a day and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day proving the efficacy and safety of this treatment regi@@ men . &quot;
52 % lower if am@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice a day ) is administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg spro@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
&quot; the C@@ min values of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r in the plasma , which were reached twice a day in the combination of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg spro@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if am@@ sprin@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice a day ) is administered in combination with 100 mg spro@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and cal@@ et@@ ra can not be given but a close monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is unknown .
&quot; there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study for use of a@@ gener@@ a in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but due to the an@@ ta@@ sia component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in it is recommended that the revenues of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and a@@ gener@@ a lie at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in combination with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , dosage adjustment is not required . &quot;
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would lower .
the effect of ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggest that ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in may sun@@ k the serum concentration of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; if these drugs should be used at the same time , be careful because Del@@ avi@@ r@@ ine could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma level . &quot;
&quot; if these drugs are used together , caution is required ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out , as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous injection of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % , resulting in an increase in the side effects associated with Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with a@@ gener@@ a , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data is available . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with a@@ gener@@ a in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed , but the plasma level of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration . &quot;
simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day resulted in increasing the C@@ MA@@ x of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol in the plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) to 2.@@ 69@@ times in comparison to the value that was observed daily without simultaneous use of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines that are listed below , including substrates , inhi@@ bits or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , may result in interactions with a@@ gener@@ a . &quot;
patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these medicines if they are used in combination with a@@ gener@@ a .
&quot; based on data from other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that ant@@ acids are not taken at the same time as a@@ gener@@ ase , as it may lead to resor@@ ption disorder . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous use of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ ants known as enzyme reduc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degradation of the plasma level of am@@ sprin@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of these drugs . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous in@@ gest@@ ing with a@@ gener@@ a can increase their plasma concentrations considerably and intensi@@ fy with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors related side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) over 7 days on subjects , the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the simultaneous delivery of a@@ gener@@ a with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended along with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids unless the potential benefits of treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , pronounced increases in the plasma level can be expected while taking A@@ gener@@ a . &quot;
&quot; since plasma level increases of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of these drugs with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; a more frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations until stabili@@ zing the mirror is recommended as the plasma concentrations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased while simultaneous injection of am@@ sprin@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a@@ gener@@ a must not be used together with or@@ ally recorded Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) while with simultaneous use of a@@ gener@@ a with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution . &quot;
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plasma level of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am by 3 to 4 @-@ Fa@@ che .
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored for respiratory symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; because of the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , there is currently no recommendation on how to adjust the am@@ on@@ avi@@ r dose if am@@ sprin@@ avi@@ r is given at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one . &quot;
simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants together with a@@ gener@@ a is recommended to increase IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) due to the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; the effect of an additional dose of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , so alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are recommended . &quot;
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( for example des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended at the same time ( see section 4.4 ) .
this medicine may only be used during pregnancy after careful weighing of the potential benefits for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
&quot; in the milk of lac@@ tation rats , am@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected , but it is not known whether or not am@@ sprin@@ avi@@ r passes into breast milk . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by inhal@@ ation in the uter@@ us until the end of the down@@ time of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 12 body weight in the offspring during breast@@ feeding . &quot;
the further development of offspring including fertility and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r to the dam .
the harm@@ lessness of a@@ gener@@ a was studied in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; the adverse side effects associated with a@@ gener@@ a were mild to moderate , occurred early and rarely resulted in the treatment of treatment . &quot;
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are in connection with taking A@@ gener@@ a or another at the same time for HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the side effects mentioned below stem from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors did not receive 1200 mg a@@ generic twice daily . &quot;
&quot; events ( grade 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as related to the study medication and performed in more than 1 % of the patients , as well as in the treatment of occurring laboratory changes ( grade 3 to 4 ) are listed . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of the body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including loss of peripheral and differential sub@@ cut@@ aneous fatty tissue , increased intra@@ ab@@ domin@@ als and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ cervi@@ cal fat accumulation . &quot;
&quot; under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral untreated people treated with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r in combination with L@@ ami@@ v@@ u@@ dine / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ u@@ dine over a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( sti@@ ern@@ ing ) ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed . &quot;
&quot; in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - pre @-@ treated patients under Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) were compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients under In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; r@@ ashes were usually mild to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ il@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and usually occurred during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with am@@ sprin@@ avi@@ r had to be canc@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis cases were reported in particular in patients with generally known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with PI pre@@ treated patients who received 600 mg a@@ gener@@ a twice a day together with low dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , the type and frequency of adverse events ( grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( grade 3 and 4 ) were very common in patients who received a@@ gener@@ a together with low dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the patient is indic@@ ative of an in@@ to@@ xi@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate necessary suppor@@ tive measures . &quot;
&quot; am@@ on@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active center of the HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thereby prevents the processing of viral g@@ ag@@ - and ga@@ g @-@ polar prot@@ ease stages with the result of a formation un@@ ri@@ fer , non @-@ infectious viral particles . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells .
the connection between the activity of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral untreated patients with the currently approved F@@ ossi@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treatment regi@@ mens with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hibit@@ ors - the described mut@@ ations are rarely observed .
&quot; in sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral untreated patients who received 700@@ mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to week 48 , with 14 isol@@ ates being gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined . &quot;
&quot; gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 out of 14 children , in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within 59 , with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors not pre@@ treated patients , showed resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults . &quot;
&quot; L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ V , I@@ 50@@ V , I@@ 50@@ V , I@@ 50@@ V , I@@ 5@@ 1@@ V , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 9@@ 3@@ L / M . &quot;
in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg spro@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) in patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred over 96 weeks following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
gen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests can be used to estimate the activity of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ eh@@ mer @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
&quot; the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in combination with increased phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance to f@@ os@@ on@@ avi@@ r and a reduced likel@@ ihood of vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) . &quot;
&quot; the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes by additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for analysis of the results of resistance tests . &quot;
phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ical data to estimate the activity of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ eh@@ mer @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs ( separ@@ ations ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
&quot; each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross @-@ resistance against k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data for cross @-@ resistance between am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 fossi@@ am@@ on@@ avi@@ r resistance trails , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ pre @-@ treated patients ( one of them demonstrated a limited resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 insul@@ ates ) , and Ti@@ pran@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 insul@@ ates ) . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ; the preservation of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
the early termination of a se@@ eding therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits which can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
&quot; proof of effectiveness of as@@ gener@@ a in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study where PI pre@@ treated adults treated with PI pre@@ treated ( 100 mg twice a day ) and a standard of care ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , mainly with low @-@ dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; one hundred thre@@ es@@ core ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to a@@ gener@@ a , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
the primary analysis confirmed the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group with regard to the time @-@ adjusted average change from the bas@@ eline value ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the plasma after 16 weeks with a non @-@ leak@@ age threshold of 0.@@ 4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
&quot; the evidence of the efficacy of un@@ bi@@ ased A@@ gener@@ a is based on two un@@ controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 @-@ 18 , of which 152 were treated with PI . &quot;
&quot; in the studies A@@ gener@@ a was tested for intake and capsules in dos@@ ages of 15 mg / kg three times a day , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice a day , with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice a day . &quot;
no low dose was given at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of N@@ R@@ TI@@ s together with a@@ gener@@ a .
&quot; after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the patients enrolled in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in the CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value . &quot;
&quot; 19 Based on this data , treatment optimisation with PI pre@@ treated children should be considered to be the expected benefit of &quot; &quot; un@@ bi@@ ased &quot; &quot; a@@ gener@@ a . &quot;
after oral administration the mean duration ( t@@ max ) up to the maximum serum concentration of am@@ sprin@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
&quot; if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) is administered together with am@@ sprin@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) , C@@ MA@@ X is reduced by 30 % . &quot;
&quot; administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decline in the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the minimal concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) was unaffected by the intake of food , although the simultaneous food intake influenced the extent and rate of resor@@ ption . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and leaves a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ obstruc@@ ted penetration of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound am@@ on@@ avi@@ r representing the active portion probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ on@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active component during the dosing interval varies depending on the total substance concentration in the Ste@@ ady State via C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or represent a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered with caution when given at the same time with a@@ gener@@ a ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of a@@ gener@@ a capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to a similar daily rate of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice a day . &quot;
am@@ on@@ avi@@ r is less bi@@ bio@@ available from the solution than from the capsules ; therefore aspir@@ ation and a@@ generic capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram @-@ based basis .
&quot; the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible , so the effect of a ren@@ al dysfunction may be limited to the elimination of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
these regi@@ mens lead to am@@ on@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those who are obtained from healthy subjects after a dose of 1200 mg of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ at@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas were ben@@ ign in humans , which correspon@@ ded to the 2,@@ 0 @-@ times ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8 @-@ times ( rat ) of human exposure , after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ at@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been explained and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; however , there was little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical studies and therapeutic use . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ core test of rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations contained in human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes was neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical everyday life by measuring AST , AL@@ T and alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase activity . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials no significant liver toxic@@ ity was observed in patients , neither during the administration of a@@ gener@@ a nor after the end of the treatment . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ity studies , which were treated from a age of 4 days , showed a high mortality in both the controls and the animals treated with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; systemic plasma exposure , which was significantly lower ( rab@@ bit ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure under therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thym@@ us ju@@ g@@ gling and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , which point to delayed development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If as@@ gener@@ a capsules are used without the rein@@ forcing additive of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sters ) , higher doses of a@@ gener@@ a ( 1200 mg twice a day ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for a@@ generic capsules is 20 mg of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 24@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; simultaneous use should be performed with caution in patients with weak or slight liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ulated R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ a should be ab@@ ated in the duration of 27 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in is an 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development . &quot;
&quot; if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) is administered in combination with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) , C@@ MA@@ X is reduced by 30 % . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ min values of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r in the plasma , which were reached twice a day in the combination of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg spro@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if am@@ sprin@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice a day ) is administered in combination with 100 mg spro@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and cal@@ et@@ ra can not be given but a close monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is unknown .
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would lower .
&quot; if these drugs are used together , caution is required ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out , as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with a@@ gener@@ a , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although no clinical data is available . &quot;
&quot; serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , her@@ edi@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine and di@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by am@@ sprin@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of these drugs . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) over 7 days on subjects , the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants together with a@@ gener@@ a is recommended to increase IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) due to the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg of eth@@ in@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg of Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) led to a decrease in the AU@@ C and C@@ min of am@@ sprin@@ avi@@ r by 22 % or more .
this medicine may only be used during pregnancy after careful weighing of the potential benefits for the mother in comparison with the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by inhal@@ ation in the uter@@ us until the end of the down@@ time of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during the breast @-@ feeding period . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of a@@ gener@@ a was studied in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the patient is indic@@ ative of an in@@ to@@ xi@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate necessary suppor@@ tive measures . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; on the other hand , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ; the preservation of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; based on these data , treatment optimisation with PI pre@@ treated children should be considered to be the expected benefit of &quot; &quot; un@@ bi@@ ased &quot; &quot; a@@ gener@@ a . &quot;
&quot; while absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ on@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active component during the dosing interval varies depending on the total substance concentration in the Ste@@ ady State via C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or represent a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered with caution when given at the same time with a@@ gener@@ a ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore the effect of a ren@@ al dysfunction may be limited to the elimination of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ at@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas were ben@@ ign in male animals , which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8 @-@ times ( rat ) of the human exposure after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ele aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; however , there was little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical studies and the therapeutic application . &quot;

&quot; toxic@@ ity studies , which were treated from a age of 4 days , showed a high mortality in both the controls and the animals treated with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; these results suggest that in juven@@ iles the met@@ aboli@@ zing channels are not fully developed , so am@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ a solution to intake is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards . &quot;
&quot; the benefits of using Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ er &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase Solution have neither been used for patients with PI pre@@ treated patients nor with PI pre@@ treated patients . &quot;
&quot; the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , a@@ generic capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
patients should be able to swallow the capsules once they are able to stop taking the solution to intake ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ a solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 28@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , since no dosage recommendation for the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ el solution can be given to take @-@ in and low dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups . &quot;
&quot; although dosage adjustment is not considered necessary for am@@ on@@ avi@@ r , an application of A@@ gener@@ a solution is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of the high propylene gly@@ col@@ oration , A@@ gener@@ a is contra@@ indicated for the intake of small children and children under the age of 4 , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these drugs , and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as ar@@ rhyth@@ mia . &quot;
patients should be advised that as@@ gener@@ a or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with a@@ gener@@ a does not prevent the risk of 47 transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ulated R@@ atio ) are available to determine the drug concentration . &quot;

&quot; increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ 49 dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; in hem@@ ophi@@ le patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase of bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ or@@ rho@@ ids are reported . &quot;
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in is an 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development . &quot;
&quot; if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) is administered in combination with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) , C@@ MA@@ X is reduced by 30 % . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous in@@ gest@@ ing with a@@ gener@@ a can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and lead with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors related side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am &apos;s oral administration is expected to significantly increase Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am plasma concentrations . &quot;
the potential risk for humans is not known . A@@ gener@@ a solution to intake may not be applied during pregnancy due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us to the contained propylene gly@@ col ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; in the milk of lac@@ tation rats , am@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected , but it is not known whether or not am@@ sprin@@ avi@@ r passes into breast milk . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by inhal@@ ation in the uter@@ us until the end of the down@@ time of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase of 55 body weight in offspring during breast@@ feeding . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of a@@ gener@@ a was studied in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are in connection with taking A@@ gener@@ a or another at the same time for HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease . &quot;
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral untreated patients with the currently approved F@@ ossi@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treatment regi@@ mens with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hibit@@ ors - the described mut@@ ations are rarely observed .
the early termination of a se@@ eding 60 therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits which can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
&quot; 62 Based on this data , treatment optimisation with PI pre@@ treated children should be considered to be the expected benefit of &quot; &quot; un@@ bi@@ ased &quot; &quot; a@@ gener@@ a . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large un@@ ction volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .

&quot; the application frequency and duration of the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the condition to be treated : • In case of recur@@ rent in the genital area , the cream is to be applied three times a week for six weeks . &quot;
&quot; before bed@@ time , the cream is thin layer to the affected areas of the skin , so that it leaves enough long ( about eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed off . &quot;
in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( the same cream but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies of 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks .
&quot; the main indicator for the efficacy was the number of patients receiving complete healing of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies , in which the patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or the placebo had to apply either daily or five times weekly . &quot;
the main indicator for the efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies involving a total of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses .
&quot; in all trials , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than placebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the total healing rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application point of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .

&quot; in rare cases severe local skin irrit@@ ations ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ations have also been observed , which have necess@@ itated treatment and / or have led to temporary physical impair@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine that necess@@ itated an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area . &quot;
no clinical experience has been given to the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream immediately following a treatment with other cut@@ aneous applied remedies for the treatment of external genital war@@ ts in the genital and peripheral area .
&quot; although limited data points to an increased rate of increase in HIV positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream has shown a lower efficacy in this group of patients with regard to the removal of the cow@@ ards . &quot;
&quot; treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , the nose , the lips , or the hair@@ line was not examined . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions generally decreases during therapy or the reactions form after completion of treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s complaints or due to the severity of local skin reactions , a treatment break can be made of several days . &quot;
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
&quot; as there is currently no data on long @-@ term cure rates of more than 36 months after treatment , other suitable therapeutic forms should be considered for super@@ fici@@ ally cell carcin@@ omas . &quot;
&quot; there are no clinical experience in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs , so the use of pre @-@ treated tumours is not recommended . &quot;
data from an open clinical study indicate that in large tumours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) a lower likel@@ ihood of response to i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy exists .
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or the ears or on the lip area within the lips . &quot;
there are only very limited data on the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses in anatom@@ ical areas outside the face and scal@@ p .
&quot; the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses on for@@ ear@@ ms and hands do not support the effectiveness in this application , therefore such application is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions occur frequently , but these reactions normally decrease in the course of the therapy or go back after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream . &quot;
&quot; if the local skin reactions cause great discomfort to the patient or are very strong , the treatment may be exposed for a few days . &quot;
data from an open clinical trial revealed that patients with more than 8 patients showed a lower total cure rate than patients with less than 8 lesi@@ ons .
&quot; because of the immune @-@ stimulating properties , i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be used with caution in patients receiving immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; from animal studies no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , release or post@@ nat@@ al development are emerging ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; although it is not possible to achieve quanti@@ fiable serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) after a unique , topical application , no recommendation can be given during the lac@@ tation period . &quot;
the most commonly diagnosed and possibly or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects in trials with three times weekly treatment were local reactions in the location of the treatment of the inc@@ war@@ ts ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the most common reported and probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects include complaints at the application site with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
&quot; the bas@@ ali@@ om patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream from a placebo @-@ controlled phase III clinical study reported adverse events . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse event , probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects , were a reaction to the application site ( 22 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) . &quot;
side effects reported from 25@@ 2 in placebo @-@ controlled phase III trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream were listed below .
&quot; the clinical evidence provided according to the test plan shows that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream , it frequently came to local skin reactions including ery@@ thema ( 30 % ) , ec@@ ologically ( 30 % ) , ec@@ c@@ ori@@ ation / di@@ lution ( 23 % ) and e@@ dem@@ a ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the clinical evidence provided according to the test plan shows that in these studies , with five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream , it was very common to severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and to severe scho@@ oling and sti@@ cking ( 19 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies investigating the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oc@@ ytes , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area . &quot;
&quot; the accidental one @-@ off or@@ ale absorption of 200 mg i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the contents of about 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever . &quot;
&quot; the most clin@@ ically severe side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted in hyp@@ ot@@ onia which norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous liquid . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation , systemic concentrations of alpha @-@ interfer@@ on and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected in the topical application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od . &quot;
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies were shown that efficacy was clearly superior to a complete healing of the cow@@ ards during an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment for over 16 weeks of placebo treatment .
&quot; in 60 % of all patients who were treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , the patients treated the cow@@ ards completely ; this was 20 % of the patients with placebo @-@ treated patients ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
&quot; complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients , compared to 5 % of 161 with placebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od &apos;s efficacy in five @-@ day use per week over 6 weeks was studied in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies . &quot;
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ fici@@ ally super@@ fici@@ ally bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
&quot; the data presented in an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years showed that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and this remained for 48 months . &quot;
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od &apos;s efficacy in three weeks of weekly treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies . &quot;
&quot; patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic nude lesi@@ ons within a con@@ ti@@ gu@@ ous 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on the un@@ ha@@ iry scal@@ p or face . &quot;
the one @-@ year data from two combined observation studies indicate a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) after one or two treatment periods .
&quot; the approved indications of external inclin@@ ations , ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ osis and super@@ fici@@ ally bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma generally do not appear in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and were therefore not examined . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a Creme was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) . &quot;
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies at the dos@@ ages studied there ( 3@@ x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or more ) .
a minimal systemic intake of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream through the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oc@@ ytes was observed during the three @-@ week use during 16 weeks .
&quot; the highest drug concentrations in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 n@@ g / ml in the face ( 12@@ ,5 mg , 1 disposable bags ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / poor ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot;
&quot; the estimated half @-@ life time was about 10@@ times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ life after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in an earlier study , which points to an extended retention of the medicine in the skin . &quot;
data on systemic exposure showed that the resor@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od after topical application on MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin of patients aged 6 to 12 years was low and comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ osis or super@@ normal bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
&quot; in a four month study on der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in rats , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased mit@@ es weight ; a study conducted for the der@@ mal application also yiel@@ ded no similar effects in the mouse . &quot;
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice during the mal@@ treatment of three days a week did not indu@@ ce tumours in the application .
&quot; the appropriate mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od possesses only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen@@ ic , a risk for man due to systemic exposure is to be regarded as very low . &quot;
&quot; tum@@ ors occurred in the group of mice treated with the active @-@ free cream , earlier and in larger number than in the control group with low U@@ VR . &quot;
&quot; − If any of the listed adverse events affect you significantly or you notice any side effects that are not specified in this use information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; ● F@@ eig@@ ni@@ zing ( Con@@ dy@@ l@@ om@@ ata ac@@ umin@@ ata ) , which have formed on the skin in the area of gen@@ itals ( sexual organs ) and anus ( anus ) ● Sur@@ face Bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma This is a common , slowly growing form of skin cancer with very low probability of spread to other parts of the body . &quot;
&quot; if untreated , it can lead to distor@@ tions , especially in the face - therefore , early detection and treatment is important . &quot;
&quot; ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses are rough areas of the skin , which occur in people who have been exposed to much sunlight during their lifetime . &quot;
Al@@ dar@@ a should only be used in the face and scal@@ p in patients with a healthy immune system where your doctor has decided that Al@@ dar@@ a is the most suitable treatment for you .
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a Creme supports your body &apos;s immune system in the production of natural substances that help your body to fight the superficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma , the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis or the virus responsible for infection with cow@@ ards . &quot;
&quot; if you have previously used Al@@ dar@@ a cream or other similar preparations , please inform your doctor about before you start treatment . &quot;
&quot; in case of accidental contact , remove the cream by rin@@ se with water . do not use cream as your doctor prescribed you . o Do not use more cream than your doctor prescribed you . o Falls response to the treated area , which give you strong discomfort , wash the cream with a mild soap and water . &quot;
&quot; once the reactions are cleared , you can continue the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if this daily cleaning is not performed under the fores@@ kin , swelling , th@@ inning of the skin or difficulties can be expected when the fores@@ kin is re@@ trac@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; do not use Al@@ dar@@ a cream in the ureth@@ ra ( ureth@@ ra ) , vagina ( vagina ) , cervi@@ x ( cervi@@ x ) or inside the anus ( anus ) . &quot;
&quot; if other medicines have serious problems with your immune system , you should not use this medication for more than one treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; if you have sexual intercourse during the infection with cow@@ ards in the genital area , the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream after sexual intercourse ( not before ) is to be carried out . &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use other medicines or used it recently even if it is not prescription medicine .
do not breast@@ feed your baby during treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream because it is not known whether i@@ od@@ ine im@@ od@@ ine is present in breast milk .
&quot; the frequency and duration of the treatment are different with cow@@ ard@@ ine , bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma and ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ osis ( see specific instructions for each application ) . &quot;
&quot; apply a thin layer of Al@@ dar@@ a cream to the clean , dry skin with the cow@@ ards and rub the cream gently on the skin until the cream is fully dra@@ ined . &quot;
men with cow@@ ards under the fores@@ kin must withdraw the fores@@ kin every day and wash the skin area below ( see section 2 &quot; What do you need to consider before using Al@@ dar@@ a cream ? &quot; ) .
please talk to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have the impression that the effect of Al@@ dar@@ a is too strong or too weak .
apply a sufficient amount of Al@@ dar@@ a cream for 6 weeks each week in order to cover the affected area and 1 cm around this area .

tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist immediately if you do not feel comfortable while using Al@@ dar@@ a cream .
&quot; if your skin re@@ acts too strongly to the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream , you should not continue using the cream to wash the affected area of the skin with water and a mild soap and communicate your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
a lower number of blood cells can make you more suscep@@ tible to infections ; it can cause you to create a blue spot faster on you or cause a whi@@ m@@ si@@ sts .
inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed adverse events affect you significantly or you notice any side effects that are not specified in this use information .
&quot; in addition , you can feel it@@ ching ( 32 % of patients ) , burning ( 26 % of patients ) or pain in the areas you have applied Al@@ dar@@ a cream ( 8 % of patients ) . &quot;
&quot; most of the time , these are lighter skin reactions that may sound again within 2 weeks after the treatment . &quot;
&quot; occasionally , some patients notice changes in the application location ( wound secre@@ tions , inflammation , swelling , scar@@ ring , skin contact , bladder , der@@ mati@@ tis ) or irrit@@ ability , nausea , dry mouth , flu @-@ like symptoms and fatigue . &quot;
&quot; occasionally some patients suffer from changes to the application location ( bleeding , inflammation , wound secre@@ tions , sensitivity , swelling , small s@@ wollen areas in the skin , ting@@ ling , irrit@@ ation , swelling of the ey@@ eli@@ ds , throat pain , throat pain , fever , weakness or ch@@ ills . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for the treatment of enzyme therapy in patients with a secure diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ene ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( the symptoms which are not related to brain or nerves ) .
&quot; this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not degra@@ ded and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them . &quot;
&quot; neuro@@ logical symptoms of M@@ PS I may occur : enlarged liver , stiff joints , difficult movements , reduced lung volume , heart and eye diseases . &quot;
treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic disorders .
&quot; the administration of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be performed in a hospital or clinic with re@@ vit@@ alizing devices , and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to administration to prevent an allergic reaction . &quot;

&quot; the study was mainly examined by the safety of the drug , but its efficacy was also measured ( by examining its effect on reducing G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) . &quot;
&quot; in children under the age of five , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by around 60 % , and half of the children treated showed a normal large liver at the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nausea , stomach pain , rash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , feeling of heat , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion site . &quot;
&quot; frequent side effects in patients under the age of five are elevated blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement size of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills . &quot;
al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be applied to patients who may be highly suscep@@ tible to hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all new information potentially known each year , which may possibly be disclosed , and , if necessary , update this summary . &quot;
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will observe patients who receive al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me regarding the reactions to in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
&quot; in June 2003 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.V. to transfer Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mamm@@ ali@@ an cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enz@@ ym@@ atic therapy in patients with a secure diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ene ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic diseases .
&quot; the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient is able to increase this , every 15 minutes in individual steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h . &quot;
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined and no dosage intake can be recommended for these patients .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined and no dosage intake can be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that are defined as any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the in@@ fusion of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be performed in an appropriate clinical setting , in which rehabilitation centres are immediately available for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase 3 study , it is expected that nearly all patients form Ig@@ G antibodies against larv@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment . &quot;
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions must be treated with caution when using al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; there is little experience regarding the resum@@ ption of treatment after a longer break , due to the theoretically increased risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions after an inter@@ ruption of treatment must be cau@@ ti@@ ously treated . &quot;
&quot; 60 minutes before the onset of in@@ fusion with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ reti@@ ca ) , to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions . &quot;
&quot; in the event of light or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be weigh@@ ed and / or reduction of in@@ fusion rates to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in case of a single , serious in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , in@@ fusion has to be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered . &quot;
in@@ fusion can be re @-@ recorded with a reduction of in@@ fusion rates to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction of in@@ fusion rates to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous response has occurred .
&quot; dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ aine , because there is a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect detri@@ mental effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; as there is no data on new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to larv@@ on@@ id@@ ase above breast milk , it is recommended not to breast@@ feed during treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
adverse events in clinical trials were mainly reported as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that were observed in 53 % of patients in phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions related to al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me observed during the phase @-@ 3 study and its extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 or older at a treatment duration of up to 4 years are listed in the following table according to the following frequency : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement in the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respiratory and facial oils ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children Un@@ desirable drug interactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged 5 and up to 12 months , reported in the table . &quot;
&quot; intraven@@ ously 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; most patients were treated with a serum version within 3 months after the onset of the treatment , with a more severe delay in patients aged 5 and over ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older ) . &quot;
&quot; up to the end of the phase 3 study ( or up to an early withdrawal from the study ) , no antibodies could be detected in 13 / 45 patients , including 3 patients with whom it never came to Ser@@ o@@ kon@@ Trial . &quot;
&quot; patients with a low @-@ low antibody level showed a robust reduction of the G@@ AG @-@ level in the urine , while in patients with high antibody ti@@ ters a variable reduction of G@@ AG in urine was detected . &quot;
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ or effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic larv@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro which did not seem to affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in urine .
&quot; the presence of antibodies did not appear to be associated with incidence of adverse drug reactions , even if the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies . &quot;
the reason for the enzyme therapy is one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated substrate and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient restoration of enzyme activity .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into lys@@ os@@ omes , most likely about man@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was examined in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study at 45 patients aged 6 to 43 . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , which showed the entire disease spectrum , the majority of the patients were from the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype . &quot;
patients were recru@@ ited if they had an accelerated exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute test .
all patients were then recru@@ ited for an open label extension study where they received 100 E / kg of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me for another 3.5 years ( 18@@ 2 weeks ) .
&quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in lung function and ability to be treated in the following table . &quot;
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me Group and from 18@@ 2 weeks in the placebo / al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as shown in the following table .
the acceptance of the expected percentage FE@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant over this period and the absolute pul@@ mon@@ ary volumes increased further propor@@ tionally to the body size of growing children .
&quot; from the 26 patients with a h@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) reached normal liver size until the end of the study . &quot;
within the first 4 weeks a clear decrease in the G@@ AG mirror was found in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg of Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) which remained constant until the end of the study .
&quot; in terms of the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation between the patients treated by the use of a combined end@@ point , the clin@@ ically significant changes to five efficacy @-@ variable ( expected percentage of normal FE@@ V , distance in the 6 @-@ minute test , range of the shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acuity ) , was generally an improvement in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a worsen@@ ing in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under the age of 5 ( 16 patients with the severe trial form and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up form ) .
&quot; in four patients , the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg because of increased G@@ ag@@ - Mir@@ ror in the urine in week 22 . &quot;
&quot; in several patients , a size growth ( n = 7 ) and an increase in weight ( n = 3 ) were determined after the Z @-@ Sc@@ ore for this age group . the younger patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed a normal mental development rate , whereas in the older patients with severe trial form there were only limited or no progress in cognitive development . &quot;
&quot; in a phase 4 study , investigations on pharmac@@ o@@ co@@ dynamic effects of various al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosing schemes were performed on the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute test . &quot;

&quot; the dosing schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative for patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosing regi@@ mens is equivalent . &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review any new information available , rate annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the medicine will be updated . &quot;
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar to those affected by older and less severely affected patients .

&quot; within the given time , the owner of the express agreement has completed the following program of studies , whose results form the basis for the annual review report on the benefit @-@ risk ratio . &quot;
this tab will record long @-@ term safety and efficacy information for patients treated with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment .
&quot; in patients suffering from M@@ PS I , there is an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase , which divi@@ des certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ cans ) , either in small amounts before or this enzyme is missing completely . &quot;
if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to any of the ingredients of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if you have performed a severe allergic reaction to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4 &quot; Which side effects are possible &quot; ) .
&quot; if you use al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines please inform your doctor if you take medicines that contain chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or proc@@ aine , because there is a possible risk of a dimin@@ ished effect of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken , including non @-@ prescription drugs . &quot;
instructions for handling - di@@ lution and application The concentrate to produce an in@@ fusion solution must be dil@@ uted prior to application and is provided for intraven@@ ous application ( see information for doctors and medical professionals ) .
&quot; the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can , if the patient is wearing this , gradually increases to a maximum dose of 43 e / kg / h every 15 minutes . &quot;
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ related involvement in the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , however , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respiratory and facial oils . &quot;
&quot; very frequently ( occur@@ ence of more than 1 of 10 patients ) : • headache • nausea • abdominal pain • Skin rash • Skin rash • Skin rash • Skin rash • P@@ ills , P@@ ills , pain in arms and legs • Incre@@ ased pulse • hyper@@ tension • less oxygen in the blood • Re@@ action at the in@@ fusion site &quot;

preparation of the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in@@ fusion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • To determine the number of th@@ inning bottles to be dil@@ uted according to the body weight of the individual patient .
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( treatment against cancer ) , and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used as sole therapy in patients who have not been treated before , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapy regi@@ mens . &quot;
&quot; to reduce side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as foli@@ c acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
&quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , an &quot; &quot; anti @-@ eme@@ tics &quot; &quot; ( medicine against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent fluid deficiency ) should be given before or after C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose blood count changes or when certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , removed or the dose should be reduced . &quot;
the active form of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed thus slow@@ s the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from dividing .
&quot; the transformation of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed into its active form is easier to replace in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active duration in cancer cells . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural end@@ othel@@ ium , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , previously treated with chemotherapy , were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ axel ( another medicine against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared to gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another medicine against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who previously had not received chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
&quot; patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared with 9.@@ 3 months in the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , A@@ lim@@ ta &apos;s survival time was 8.3 months , compared to 7.@@ 9 months in doc@@ et@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , however , patients with whom the cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells , in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta , showed longer survival times than with the comparative drug . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.V. to introduce A@@ lim@@ ta in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; each bottle has to be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a resolution of 25 mg / ml . &quot;
the corresponding volume of the required do@@ - sis is removed from the diar@@ rhe@@ a and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is indicated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer except in the majority of hard drive epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see Section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with RA advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer except for pre@@ valent hard @-@ plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) administered intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - In@@ fusion on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer after previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid must be given the day before and on the day of the p@@ em@@ et@@ rec@@ ated administration and the day after the treatment . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , at least 5 doses of foli@@ c acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the therapy period and for another 21 days after the last p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose . &quot;
patients must also receive an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) a week before the first p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed dose and after each third treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients receiving p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , a complete blood count should be created before each application , including a differentiation of the leu@@ k@@ oc@@ ytes and a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te count . &quot;
&quot; alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Alan@@ ine @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose @-@ examination must take place taking account of the N@@ adi@@ rs of the blood count or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the preceding treatment cycles . &quot;
&quot; after recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria meet the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC Grade 2 bleeding .
&quot; should patients develop non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ grade 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be interrupted until the patient has the value before treatment &quot;
treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be abor@@ ted if in patients after 2 dose ab@@ duc@@ es a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity degree 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - continues in the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies have no indication that in patients at the age of 65 Jah@@ - or over 65 years of age there is an increased secondary effect risk .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data about safety and efficacy .
clinical trials were not necessary in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ clearing of ≥ 45 ml / min no dosage adjustment which goes beyond the dose adjustments recommended for all patients .
the data base in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper limit value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; the 3,@@ 0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in case of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 @-@ times the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically studied in studies . &quot;
&quot; patients need to be monitored with regard to bone therapy and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed may not be administered to patients before the absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ar number once again reaches a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number once again reaches a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ . &quot;
&quot; dosage reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of the absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity as observed in previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ f@@ ec@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was observed when a pre@@ treatment with foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place . &quot;
&quot; therefore , all patients with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must be instructed to apply foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a proph@@ y- lac@@ tic measure to reduce treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous in@@ gest@@ ing non@@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( &gt; 1.3 g. daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; all patients , for which therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , should avoid taking N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ life for at least 5 days before the therapy , at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients with whom these events occurred had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing high blood pressure or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with a clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space , drainage of the eff@@ u@@ ency before p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment should be considered . &quot;
&quot; 5 severe cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were reported in clinical trials with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed occasionally when this substance is usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ated vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; there is the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible pe@@ eling of the reproductive capacity by p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be advised in front of the treatment g@@ inn to consult with regard to the sper@@ ma@@ ker@@ age . &quot;
&quot; in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non@@ ster@@ oidal anti ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can lead to reduced p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed @-@ elimination with the result of increased occurrence of side effects . &quot;
caution is therefore advisable if high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses are used in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) .
&quot; i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; as there is no data regarding the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ life like Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , simultaneous use with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must be avoided at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed . &quot;
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of coag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) when the decision was taken to treat the patient with oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; there are no data for the use of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - or an@@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites , severe birth defects are expected during pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should not be used during pregnancy , except if necessary and after careful weighing of benefits for the mother and the risk of fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible damage to reproductive ability is due to p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be advised against the beginning of the treatment to obtain advice regarding the blocking of sperm . &quot;
it is not known whether p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed in breast milk passes and unwanted effects in the breast@@ fed baby cannot be excluded .
&quot; the following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse events reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ othel@@ i@@ oma , and the random@@ ised c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , and 163 patients with mes@@ othel@@ i@@ oma who were random@@ ised to receive c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;

&quot; for this table , a threshold of 5 % was defined with regard to the inclusion of all events in which the reporting doctor held a connection with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed and c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for possible . &quot;
&quot; clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC toxic@@ ity , reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients random@@ ized c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , included ar@@ rhyth@@ mia and mot@@ oric neu@@ rop@@ athy . &quot;

&quot; clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC toxic@@ ity , reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients who were random@@ ised to receive p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , included sup@@ rav@@ entri@@ cular ar@@ rhyth@@ mia . &quot;
&quot; clin@@ ically relevant laboratory toxic@@ ity level 3 and 4 was similar to the results of three individual p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed mon@@ otherapy studies ( n = 164 ) of phase 2 , excluding neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared to 5.3 % ) and an increase in al@@ anine ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) . &quot;
these far@@ ew@@ ells are likely to result in differences in patient population since the pha@@ k@@ se 2 studies both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and clearly pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal bas@@ eline values of liver function tests .

&quot; for this table , a threshold of 5 % was defined for the inclusion of all events in which the reporting doctor held a connection with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed and c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; clin@@ ically relevant toxic@@ ity , reported in ≥ 1 % and ≤ 5 % ( common ) of patients who received random@@ ised c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , included : &quot;

&quot; severe cardiovascular and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular insulin and tran@@ sit@@ ory isch@@ em@@ ic attacks were reported in clinical studies with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , commonly used in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials in patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment were occasionally reported cases of co@@ li@@ - tis ( including intestinal and rec@@ tal bleeding , sometimes fatal , intestinal per@@ fo@@ - , intestinal nec@@ ro@@ sis and ty@@ ph@@ litis ) . &quot;
&quot; from clinical studies , cases of sometimes fatal inter@@ sti@@ tial pneum@@ oni@@ tis with respiratory in@@ suffici@@ ency were reported in patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment . &quot;
it was reported cases of acute kidney failure in p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chemotherapy agents ( see section 4.4 ) .
cases of radiation pneum@@ oni@@ tis were reported in patients who were ir@@ radi@@ ated before or after their p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ) is an ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti @-@ fol@@ ate , which ex@@ erts its effect by interrup@@ ting important , acid @-@ dependent metabolic processes that are necessary for cell rep@@ lication . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies showed that P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed acts as an anti @-@ fol@@ ate with several attacks by blocking the thy@@ mi@@ dy@@ lat@@ syn@@ th@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) and gly@@ c@@ ami@@ dri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ ot@@ id@@ for@@ - m@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , the fol@@ ate @-@ dependent key enzymes in the de nov@@ o Bi@@ osyn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ ine and purple cle@@ oti@@ des . &quot;
&quot; E@@ MP@@ HAC@@ IS , a multi @-@ centric , random@@ ised , simple @-@ blind phase 3 study of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ven patients with malign@@ ant ple@@ ural end@@ othel@@ ium showed that patients who were treated with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had a clin@@ ically significant advantage of a medi@@ an 2.8 @-@ month prolonged survival compared to patients treated with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
the primary analysis of this study was conducted in the population of all patients receiving check@@ sums in the treatment arm ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural end@@ othel@@ ium was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 2@@ 12 patients ) compared to the all@@ @-@ c@@ is@@ pla@@ - tin arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms resulted in an improvement of the lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a deterioration in lung function over time in the control arm .
&quot; a multi @-@ centric , random@@ ised , open phase III study with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA versus doc@@ et@@ axel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC has been treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA treated patients ( Int@@ ent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and from 7.@@ 9 months in patients treated with doc@@ et@@ axel ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on overall survival was in favour of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 0.@@ 78 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 61 @-@ 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2.@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) . &quot;
&quot; limited data from a separately random@@ ised , controlled Phase 3 study showed that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed between patients with ( n = 540 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre@@ treatment with doc@@ et@@ axel are similar . &quot;
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination compared to gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
&quot; mean P@@ FS was 4.@@ 8 months for the combination of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( adjusted HR = 1.@@ 04 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 94 - 1.@@ 15 ) , the overall response rate was 30.@@ 6 % ( 95 % CI = 25.@@ 0 - 3@@ 1,4 ) for the combination gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; the analysis of the impact of NSC@@ LC hist@@ ology on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant far@@ ew@@ ells in accordance with hist@@ ology , see table below . &quot;
&quot; CI = interval @-@ to @-@ treat ; IT@@ T = value @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = Size of the total population a Statisti@@ cal Sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant for non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy , with a total confidence interval for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) clearly below the non @-@ level limit of 1.@@ 17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin required less trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28.@@ 9 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 1.8 % versus 4.5 % , p = 0.00@@ 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the patients required the gift of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin / bow@@ el opo@@ e@@ tin ( 10.@@ 4 % versus 18.@@ 1 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , G @-@ CS@@ F / GM @-@ CS@@ F ( 3.1 % versus 6.0 % , p = 0.00@@ 4 ) , and iron supplements ( 4.3 % versus 7.0 % , p = 0.0@@ 21 ) . &quot;
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed after administration as a chemotherapy were examined in 4@@ 26 cancer patients with different solid tumours in doses ranging from 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in in@@ fusion zones over a period of 10 minutes .

the resulting solution is clear and the colouring varies from color@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish @-@ yellow without compromising the quality of the product .
&quot; it is used in obes@@ e adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with a low @-@ cal@@ orie , fat @-@ reduced diet . &quot;
patients who take allergy and have no weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
&quot; these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they cannot metabol@@ ise some fats in the food , causing about a quarter of the fats covered with the food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; in a third study , All@@ i was compared with 3@@ 91 overweight patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in both studies in patients with BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who took about 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg in taking placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the study with All@@ i in patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no weight loss could be observed for patients . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily spots at after , fl@@ atus ( winds ) with step lab@@ eling , Stu@@ h@@ ld@@ rang , gre@@ asy / o@@ ily chair , finish o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( Fä@@ h ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( winds ) and soft chairs . &quot;
it must not be used in patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
&quot; it may not be used in patients suffering from long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( where insufficient nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract ) or chol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant women or nursing mothers . &quot;
&quot; in July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited for placing or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K within the European Union . &quot;
allergy is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ ical and fat @-@ reduced diet .
&quot; all@@ i must not be used by children and young people under 18 , as there is not enough data about efficacy and safety . &quot;
&quot; however , since or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ally resor@@ bed , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary for elderly people and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function . &quot;
• Pre@@ mature treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.5 ) • Chr@@ onic mal@@ absorption syndrome • chol@@ est@@ ase • pregnancy ( see section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ mature treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the probability of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single meal or fat @-@ rich diet .
&quot; as weight reduction can be accompanied by improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i because the dosage of the anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic should be adjusted if necessary . &quot;
patients who use all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of this medicine has to be adjusted .
&quot; it is recommended to take additional pregnancy @-@ related measures , in order to prevent possible failure of oral contrac@@ eption in the case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
in a study on the interactions of drugs as well as in several cases with simultaneous application of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in a lowering of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma is observed .
&quot; in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ Val@@ ues ( internationally normal@@ ised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in most patients treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K and the beta carot@@ ene were in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be advised to take a supple@@ mental mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after receiving a one @-@ off dose , A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one was observed with a limited number of healthy volunteers who simultaneously received or@@ list@@ at , a slight decrease in A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies showed no direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal and related to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the medicine , as the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented . &quot;
the gastro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg for a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
&quot; the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data not estimated ) . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of known side effects identified after the market launch of Or@@ list@@ at is unknown , as these events have been voluntarily reported by a population of uncertain magnitude . &quot;
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to anxiety regarding possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days at normal and obes@@ e subjects without significant clinical findings .
&quot; in the majority of reported cases of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose , there were either no side effects or similar side effects reported in the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
&quot; based on studies on humans and animals , a rapid reg@@ ression of any systemic effects caused by or@@ list@@ at &apos;s lip @-@ inhibit@@ ing properties can be assumed . &quot;
the therapeutic effect is in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by means of co@@ valent bonding to the active Ser@@ in @-@ Rest of the ga@@ stri@@ an and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atic li@@ pas@@ es .
&quot; clinical trials were derived that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at was taken three times a day , which blocks absorption of about 25 % of the dietary fat . &quot;
&quot; two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled trials of adults with BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 prove the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ ical , fat @-@ reduced diet . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to bas@@ eline value ( at the time of random@@ ization ) , was assessed as follows : as a change in the body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as percentage of the study participants who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although in both studies the weight reduction was observed over 12 months , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months . &quot;
the average dietary change in the Gesamt@@ chol@@ esterin was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( bas@@ eline 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( bas@@ eline 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
average change in LD@@ L cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( bas@@ eline : 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( bas@@ eline : 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the waist circum@@ ference was the average change -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting value 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( starting value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ metabol@@ ised or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after the oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; 7 In general , non @-@ met@@ aboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in the plasma could be detected spor@@ adi@@ cally and at extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) without any signs of cum@@ ulation . &quot;
&quot; in a study with obes@@ e patients receiving the minimum system@@ ically resor@@ bed dose , two main metabol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed Lac@@ tone ring ) and M3 ( M1 , after spl@@ itting up the N @-@ For@@ my@@ l @-@ leu@@ c@@ ine group ) , could be identified , representing approximately 42 % of total plasma concentration . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated dose , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogenic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot be seen as a special danger to humans . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system The holder of approval for the market must ensure that the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system , according to the version of July 2007 , is described and works before and while the product is available on the market . &quot;

remember to ask your doctor beforehand if you are not used to physical activity . • Sta@@ y during the intake and even after the intake of all@@ i physically active .
&quot; • Al@@ i should not be taken for more than 6 months . • If you cannot detect any reduction of your weight after 12 weeks of use , please consult your doctor or pharmac@@ ist for advice . &quot;
&quot; under certain circumstances , you must stop taking all@@ i . • In case of a successful weight loss , it is not a matter of just changing the diet and then returning to the old habits . &quot;
&quot; • If less than one hour has passed since the last meal , take the capsule after . • If more than one hour has passed since the last meal , take no capsule . &quot;
&quot; flat@@ ul@@ ence with and without ble@@ aching , sudden or increased bow@@ string and soft chair ) are attributed to the mechanism of action ( see Section 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; severe allergic reactions • Seri@@ ous allergic reactions can be seen in the following changes : severe short@@ ness of breath , sweat out@@ breaks , rash , it@@ ching , swelling in the face , heart rate , circul@@ atory collapse . &quot;
&quot; 29 Very frequent side effects These can occur in more than 1 of 10 people taking all@@ i . • flat@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) with and without o@@ ily discharge • A sudden bow@@ string • Smo@@ oth@@ ful or o@@ ily chair • Wei@@ cher See Find your doctor or pharmac@@ ist , if any of these side effects ampli@@ fies or significantly adver@@ sely affects you . &quot;
&quot; frequent side effects These can occur in 1 of 10 people who are taking all@@ i . • Ga@@ stri@@ c ( abdominal ) pain , • In@@ kontin@@ enz ( See ) • aqu@@ eous / liquid stool • increased bow@@ string • anxiety inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of these side effects ampli@@ fies or you significantly imp@@ acted . &quot;
an effect on blood tests It is not known how frequently these effects occur . • Incre@@ ase of certain liver enz@@ ym@@ phs • effects on blood cl@@ ot@@ ting in patients who take war@@ far@@ in or other blood dil@@ uting ( anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ant ) medicines .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed adverse events affect you significantly or you notice any side effects that are not specified in this information .
&quot; the most common side effects are associated with the mode of action of the capsules , resulting in increased fat from the body . &quot;
&quot; these side effects usually occur within the first few weeks of the treatment , as at this time you may have not yet consistently reduced the fat percentage of the diet . &quot;
&quot; with the following basic rules you can learn to minimize the diet @-@ related side effects : • Beg@@ in a few days , or better a week before the first intake of capsules with a fat @-@ reduced diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of portions you normally take . &quot;
&quot; if you know exactly how much you eat , the likel@@ ihood that you exceed your fat limit decreases . • Distri@@ bute your recommended fat volume evenly on daily meals . &quot;
&quot; save the amount of calories and fat that you may take per meal , not to take them in the form of a fat @-@ rich main court or a substantial dessert , as you might have done in other programs for weight reduction . &quot;
&quot; • Ke@@ ep the medicine in@@ accessible for children . • Do not store it any more after the exp@@ ir@@ ation date specified on the box . • Ke@@ ep the container tightly closed to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ lic@@ a@@ gel , which serve to keep the capsules dry . &quot;
do not swallow it in any case . • You can carry your daily dose all@@ i in the blue transport box ( Shuttle ) which is included in this package .

obesity has an influence on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases such as : • hyper@@ tension • diabetes • heart disease • stroke • Cer@@ tain cancers • Oste@@ o@@ arthritis speak to your doctor about your risk for these diseases .
&quot; lasting weight loss , for example by improving diet and more exercise , can prevent serious diseases and have a positive effect on your health . &quot;
&quot; choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients , and gradually learn to eat heal@@ th@@ ily . &quot;
&quot; energy is also measured in kil@@ o@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you will also find as indication of food packaging . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should consume at most per day . &quot;
note the tables below in this section . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with each meal .
&quot; the amount of calories recommended for you can be found in the information below , which indicates the number of calories that is suitable for you . • Because of the capsule &apos;s mode of action , compliance with the recommended intake of fat is crucial . &quot;
&quot; if you take the same amount of fat as before , this may mean that your body cannot handle this amount of fat . &quot;
&quot; by adher@@ ence to the recommended fat intake , you can maximize the weight loss and at the same time reduce the likel@@ ihood of diet @-@ related accompanying symptoms . • You should try to gradually and continuously remove weight . &quot;
&quot; 34 . this reduced cal@@ orie intake should allow you to gradually and continuously lose about 0.5 kg per week , without developing frustr@@ ations and dis@@ appointments . &quot;
&quot; the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; &quot; Low physical activity &quot; &quot; means that you exercise daily only little or no , stairs , work in the garden or perform other physical activities . • &quot; Medium physical activity &quot; means that you exercise 150 k@@ cal per day , for example by 3 km walking , 30 to 45 minutes walk or 2 km running in 15 minutes . &quot;
&quot; • For a lasting weight loss , it is necessary to set up realistic cal@@ ory and fat targets and also adhere to them . • Sen@@ se is a nutrition journal with information on the cal@@ ory and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before you begin taking all@@ i . &quot;
the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a nutritional plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you feed cal@@ orie and fatty acids and give guidelines to become more physically active .
&quot; combined with a program tailored to your type to support weight loss , this information helps you to develop a healthier lifestyle and achieve your target weight . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ is is used in chem@@ otherap@@ ies which are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as in chemotherapy , the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( like cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , di@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine used as an anti @-@ eme@@ tics ) .
the use in patients under the age of 18 is not recommended as there is not enough information about the effects in this age group .
&quot; this means that the drug inhi@@ bits the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; in three main studies , Alo@@ is examined 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy , which are strong or moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting , showed 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) . &quot;
&quot; in chemotherapy , the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ is showed no vom@@ iting ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ is ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 out of 191 patients ) .
&quot; in March 2005 , the European Commission granted approval to the company of Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ is is indicated : for the prevention of acute nausea and vom@@ iting in highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , due to cancer and the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , due to cancer . &quot;
the effectiveness of alo@@ ga@@ ol for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy may be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given prior to chemotherapy .
&quot; since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the colon , patients should be closely monitored with am@@ nesty or signs of an acute I@@ le@@ us after injection . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is provided with simultaneous injection of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ T interval is leng@@ th@@ ened or which tend to be such an extension . &quot;
&quot; in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ is is not intended to be used for preventing or treating nausea and vom@@ iting in the days following chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron interfer@@ ed with the activity of the five chem@@ otherapeu@@ tics examined against tumours ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , di@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) . &quot;
&quot; a clinical study showed no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interactions between a single IV dose pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a steady @-@ stat@@ e- concentration of oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ ami@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , the simultaneous administration of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 In@@ hibit@@ ors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , ox@@ et@@ ine , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ser@@ tr@@ aline and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ ine ) had no significant effect on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; experiences for Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron use in human pregn@@ ancies are not present , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the treating physician . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials were the most common in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams to observed side effects ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which were at least likely to be associated with al@@ ga@@ ol , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and aut@@ op@@ sy ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the place of administration ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing testim@@ onies . &quot;
in the group with the highest dosage a similar frequency of adverse events occurred as in the other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ effect relationships observed .
&quot; no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were performed , but due to the large distribution volume , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not an effective therapy for al@@ op@@ xi@@ de over@@ dose . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ised double blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients receiving a moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 of D@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 m@@ g. of Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life 7.@@ 3 hours ) were given that was given intraven@@ ously on day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one . &quot;
&quot; in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , 6@@ 67 patients who received a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zin and 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared with patients who were given intraven@@ ously on day 1 . &quot;
results of studies with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study of strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summ@@ ar@@ ised in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters , including the Q@@ t@@ c interval , were comparable to the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; after the findings of pre @-@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in the v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and extend the duration of the action potential . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the study carried out in 2@@ 21 healthy subjects was the assessment of the EC@@ G effects of intraven@@ ous pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg . &quot;
resor@@ ption Accor@@ ding to intraven@@ ous gift a slow elimination of the plasma concentrations follows an initial decrease in the body with an average terminal half @-@ life of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ X ) and the area under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dos@@ ed in the entire dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ / kg in seconds and cancer patients .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous injection of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean ( ± SD ) increase of the pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day 5 . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simulations indicate that the total tex@@ position ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) achieved at once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0,@@ 25 mg of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron to 3 consecutive days was comparable ; however , the C@@ MA@@ X was higher after the one @-@ time delivery of 0.@@ 75 mg . &quot;
&quot; about 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys and about 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , which in comparison to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor . &quot;
&quot; in @-@ vitro studies on metabol@@ isation have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in lesser degree , the I@@ so@@ enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine , pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ altered ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
&quot; after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous bolt injection , the total body temperature was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; although in patients with severe liver dysfunction , the terminal elimination time and the average systemic exposure with pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , however , a reduction of the dose is not justified . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects have been observed only after ex@@ positions which are considered sufficient beyond the maximum human@@ istic exposure , suggest@@ ing a low relevance for clinical use . &quot;
&quot; 10 prec@@ lin@@ ical studies indicate that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and can pro@@ long the duration of action . &quot;
&quot; high doses of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded in approximately the 30 @-@ times of the therapeutic exposure in humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to an increased incidence of liver tumours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid gland , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al glands ) and skin tumours in rats , but not in mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages and since Alo@@ is is intended for unique use in humans , the relevance of these results is very low for humans . &quot;
the holder of this approval for the transfer of funds must inform the European Commission of the plans for the placing of the drug approved within the scope of this decision .

&quot; in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) approved a negative report , in which the authorisation of the treatment of the medicines prescribed for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended for the treatment of Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution . &quot;
&quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resem@@ ble a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same drug @-@ like ingredient that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; reference drug &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
al@@ ph@@ eon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by viral infection ) .
&quot; in a micro@@ scopic examination the liver tissue has damage , and the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ ine Amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are increased in the blood standard . &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a yeast produced by a gene ( DNA ) , which stimulates the metabolism of the active substance . &quot;
&quot; al@@ ph@@ eon producer submitted data that demonstrate the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( substance structure , composition and purity of the medicine , mode of action , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study of patients with hepatitis C , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference drug in 4@@ 55 patients . &quot;
the study measured how many patients after 12 of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after setting the treatment responded to the drug ( i.e. no signs of virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non @-@ business purposes only provided the E@@ MEA is acknowledged .
&quot; furthermore , concerns have been expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed will not be sufficient . &quot;
the number of hepatitis C patients who responded to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in the clinical trial .
&quot; after the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease again ret@@ ar@@ ded to more patients than with the reference drug . moreover , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from this , the test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the drug is an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) , is not adequately vali@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; it can be used for the treatment of im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection associated with crust formation ) and small infected in@@ firm@@ ations ( cra@@ cking or cutting wounds ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) , because Alar@@ go may not affect this type of infections . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under the age of 18 , the skin area to be treated may not exceed 2 % of the body surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced ) and inhi@@ bits the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients with placebo matched the treatment .
&quot; in the treatment of infected skin wound , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : if the results of both studies were taken together at skin wound , approximately 90 % of both groups responded to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; however , in these two studies , however , Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough when treating ab@@ sc@@ esses ( freezing cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or infections caused by MR@@ SA . &quot;
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is an irrit@@ ation at the order .
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go out@@ weigh the risks in the short @-@ term treatment of the following superficial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small in@@ firm@@ ations , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
&quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . a permit for the transfer of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union . &quot;
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in the case of sensi@@ tization or severe local irrit@@ ation by the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sage , the treatment is canc@@ eled , the o@@ int@@ ment is carefully wi@@ ped off and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection has begun . &quot;
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as patho@@ gen or is suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical trials of secondary infected open wounds , the efficacy of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) . &quot;
alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2 to 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected place occurs .
the effect of the simultaneous use of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical remedies on the same skin area has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended .
&quot; due to the low plasma concentrations , which were achieved in humans after topical application on sk@@ imp@@ y skin or infected superficial wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not expected ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , the mean Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ X were increased by 81 % after topical application of 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment on decreased skin of healthy adult men . &quot;
&quot; due to the low systemic exposure to topical use in patients , dose adjustments are not considered necessary when topical re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral consumption and are inadequate in relation to a statement on the birth and fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment should only be used during pregnancy if topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the administration of a systemic antibiotic .
deciding whether breast@@ feeding continues / ends or the treatment with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued / terminated is to weigh between the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the infant and the benefit of the alt@@ ar@@ go therapy for the woman .
&quot; in clinical trials of 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections , which have applied Al@@ tar@@ go , was the most commonly reported side effect irrit@@ ation at the place of performance , which concerned about 1 % of the patients . &quot;
&quot; ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deri@@ v@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) . &quot;
the active mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin depends on the selective in@@ hibition of the bacterial protein synthesis through interaction at a specific binding site of the 50s sub@@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome that differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the binding site is involved in the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ B@@ ind@@ entation Centre and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase Centre .
&quot; by binding on this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits the pe@@ p@@ ti@@ dy transfer , block partial P @-@ binding interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s @-@ ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units . &quot;
&quot; should , due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance the application of retin@@ os@@ am@@ ulin seems question@@ able at least some forms of infection , a consultation should be sought by experts . &quot;
&quot; no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of retin@@ os@@ am@@ ulin was detected opposite S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in case of non @-@ response to treatment with S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of strains with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered . &quot;
resor@@ ption In a study with healthy adults 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment was applied daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact skin for up to 7 days .
&quot; of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sage twice a day for 5 days for topical treatment of secon@@ dar@@ ily infected traum@@ atic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained . &quot;
the sampling took place on days 3 or 4 in adult patients before the medication and in the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
&quot; however , the maximum individual systemic absorption on humans after topical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment to 200 c@@ m2 of decreased skin ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 n@@ g · h / ml ) 6@@ 60 times lower than the retin@@ os@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP inhibit@@ ing . &quot;
metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ bes was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and lower participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; in studies on oral toxic@@ ity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were performed over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid changes . &quot;
in @-@ vitro examination of gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes and in rats @-@ micro@@ kern@@ test for in @-@ vi@@ vo investigation of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
&quot; there was neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility in oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , which has been achieved up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure in humans ( topical application on 200 c@@ m2 of sk@@ imp@@ y skin ) : &quot;
in an embry@@ onic toxic@@ ity study of rats at oral dos@@ ages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( corresponding to the ≥ 3 @-@ times the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) development toxic@@ ity ( decreased body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed os@@ si@@ fication ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity .
&quot; the owner of the approval for the inverter must ensure that a pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system , as presented in module 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorisation application ( version 6.2 ) , is present and works before the product is marketed and as long as the marketing product is marketed . &quot;
&quot; the owner of the authorisation for the market is obliged to conduct detailed studies and additional pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance activities in the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance plan as described in Version 1 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) , as well as all additional updates of the R@@ MP agreed with the CH@@ MP . &quot;
&quot; as described in the CH@@ MP &quot; Gui@@ deline on Risk Management Systems for Medic@@ inal Products for humane use , &quot; the updated R@@ MP should be submitted at the same time with the next Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report . &quot;

&quot; ambient rix is used for the protection against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between 1 and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases . &quot;
&quot; ambient rix is used as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses , and a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during the imm@@ uni@@ zation and it is ensured that the vacc@@ ination of two doses can be completed . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her dose is desired against hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or any other hepatitis B or B vaccine can be given . &quot;
&quot; vacc@@ ines work by &quot; &quot; teach &quot; &quot; the immune system ( the natural def@@ ences of the body ) , as it can fight against a disease . &quot;
&quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system detects viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; foreign &quot; and produces antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix contains the same ingredients as the vaccine , which has been approved since 1996 and has been approved since 1997 . &quot;
&quot; the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , however , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of an existing vacc@@ ination plan consisting of three doses . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adult contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the use of Twin@@ rix adult were also used as evidence of the application of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of the efficacy was the share of vacc@@ inated children , which had developed a protective antibody concentrations one month after the last inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; in an additional study with 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six month and a 12 month gap between the two inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; in between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children , Ambi@@ rix performed a month after the last inj@@ ections for the development of protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B . &quot;
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix was similar at a six @-@ month gap between the inj@@ ections .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ enta ( observed with more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , lack of appetite , pain at the injection point , redness , mat@@ ur@@ ation ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; ambi@@ tions may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) . &quot;
&quot; in August 2002 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ c@@ als to the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ c@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the standardi@@ zation plan for basic di@@ mm@@ ization with Ambi@@ rix consists of two doses , the first dose is administered at the date of the choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
vacc@@ ination for hepatitis A and hepatitis B can be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or with a combination vaccine .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) antibody levels are the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
&quot; it is not yet fully assured whether immun@@ o@@ competent persons who have responded to hepatitis C vacc@@ ination , need a refres@@ her vacc@@ ination as protection , since they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory even in cases of no longer det@@ ectable antibodies . &quot;
&quot; 3 As with all injection @-@ vacc@@ ines , appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the injection of the vaccine . &quot;
&quot; if a quick protection against hepatitis B is required , the standard vaccine is recommended with the combination vaccine that contains 360 ELISA @-@ units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in the case of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with immune system disorders , there may be no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody value after pri@@ mer injury , so that in these cases further vacc@@ ines may be required . &quot;
&quot; since an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimal outcome in the glut@@ eal muscles , these injection methods should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; however , in cases of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or coag@@ ulation disorders , ambient light can be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous as in these cases , after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular gift to bleeding can occur . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix was given in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection simultaneously with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eria , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects it must be assumed that no adequate immune response is achieved .
&quot; in a clinical trial conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ur@@ ation , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headache and fever was similar to the frequency observed in previous Thi@@ omer@@ ang and preser@@ v@@ ative @-@ containing vaccine formulation . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines were administered at a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to including 15 years . &quot;
&quot; in a study with 300 participants aged 12 to 15 , the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared with that of the 3 @-@ dose @-@ combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; the only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and mat@@ ur@@ ation on a calculation basis per acc@@ ine ambi@@ x , but not on a calculation basis per person . &quot;
&quot; pain was observed after the administration of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.@@ 7 % of the subjects , compared to 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in the subjects after the addition of a dose of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the subjects who had given the ambient dose reported pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % in the subjects who were vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; however , the frequency of mat@@ ur@@ ation was comparable to the test cycle ( i.e. across the entire vaccine cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the subjects who received Ambi@@ rix compared to 3@@ 6.2 % in the subjects receiving the 3 @-@ dose @-@ combination vaccine ) . &quot;
the frequency of pronounced pain and mat@@ ur@@ ation was low and comparable to that observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme .
&quot; in a comparative study of 1 to 11 years old vacc@@ ines , the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the ambient group was similar to that observed in administration with the 3 @-@ dose @-@ combination vaccine with 360 ELISA @-@ units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix a frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported . &quot;
the share of vacc@@ ines that reported severe side effects during the 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not different .
&quot; in clinical trials conducted in vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to including 15 years , the serum conversion rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V were 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; serum conversion rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. , in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; 7 In a comparative study carried out at 12@@ - and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ enta and 147 were awarded the standard combination vaccine with three doses . &quot;
&quot; in the 28@@ 9 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was worth@@ less , the Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 following the adoption of the 3 @-@ dose vaccine significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; the immune responses , which were reached in a clinical comparative study at 1 @-@ 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after completion of the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ doses regi@@ men with ambient light or a 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in people aged between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be proven for at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ enta in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme . &quot;
the immun@@ reaction observed in this study was comparable to the immun@@ ological reaction observed after 3 doses of a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A @-@ Virus and 10
a clinical study of 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies comparable to the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme is comparable to that in the 0 @-@ 12 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
&quot; if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix was administered at the same time with the vacc@@ ination of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eria , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and 8 Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens . &quot;
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and serum conversion rates as for earlier formulation .
the vaccine is examined both before and after the res@@ us@@ pen@@ ing of any foreign particles and / or physical visible changes .

&quot; the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through viral food and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other means , such as bathing in poll@@ uted waters . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may need a stationary treatment . &quot;
&quot; as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix cannot completely protect against an infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even if the full vacc@@ ination series was completed with 2 doses . &quot;
if you / your child are infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus before the two vacc@@ ines have been administered ( although you / your child feel uncomfortable or sick at the time of the vacc@@ ination ) vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those after hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be medi@@ ated .
• if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to ambient rix or any component of this vaccine including ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
&quot; allergic reaction may be caused by it@@ ching skin r@@ ashes , breathing difficulties or swelling of the face or tongue . • If your child has an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B . • If you / your child have a severe infection with fever . &quot;
• If you want to quickly have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before serving the second dose ) .
&quot; at a possible risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with ambi@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; instead , he / her child will recommend 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vacc@@ ination dose ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface ) . &quot;
the second vaccine dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given one month after the first dose and should give you a vacc@@ ination protection against your child before the end of the vacc@@ ination series .
&quot; if you / your child are weakened due to illness or treatment in your / her body &apos;s immune system , or if you / your child undergo a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; ambient rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination may not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is . &quot;
21 Sa@@ y your doctor if you / your child takes further medicine ( including those who have been vacc@@ inated without prescription ) or if you / your child have been vacc@@ inated or if you / your child have received / has given / has or that is planned in the near future .
&quot; however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses . &quot;
&quot; if another vaccine has to be given at the same time with ambient light , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as different limbs as possible . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix is to be given at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; normally , ambient pregnant women or nursing women will not be given , unless it is urgent that they are vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B . &quot;
important information about any other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
&quot; if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible . &quot;
♦ is very common ( more than 1 case per 10 dec@@ im@@ al doses ) : • P@@ ain or discomfort on the insertion point or redness • Mat@@ ching • irrit@@ ability • irrit@@ ability • headache • loss of appetite
♦ often ( up to 1 case per 10 dec@@ im@@ ated doses ) : • swelling at the injection site • fever ( above 38 ° C ) • Li@@ zz@@ iness • Ga@@ stro @-@ intestinal disorders
&quot; further side effects reported in days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B are very rare ( less than 1 case per 10,000 dec@@ im@@ ated doses ) are reported : &quot;
&quot; these include locally restricted or extended precip@@ itation that can itch or ve@@ al , swelling of the eyes and face , striking breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden blood pressure drop and un@@ consciousness . &quot;
&quot; flu @-@ like complaints , including ch@@ ills , muscle and joint pains conv@@ ul@@ sions , di@@ zz@@ iness , dis@@ sen@@ sions such as ting@@ ling and &quot; ant run , &quot; multiple sclerosis , diseases of the optic nerve , loss of sensation or mobility of some body parts , severe head@@ aches and stiff@@ ness of the neck , inter@@ ruption of normal brain functions &quot;
&quot; f@@ ain@@ ting inflamm@@ ations of some blood vessels discomfort or feeling of sickness , loss of appetite , diar@@ rho@@ ea , and stomach pain , swelling prop@@ ens@@ ity to bleeding or bru@@ ising ( bru@@ ises ) caused by waste of the amount of blood . &quot;
23 inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects you / your child significantly adver@@ sely affect or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this package .
ambient rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; based on the data that has become known since the first approval for the market , the CH@@ MP agreed that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive . &quot;
&quot; however , because Ambi@@ rix was put into circulation only in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug is limited due to low patient expos@@ ures . &quot;
am@@ mon@@ aps can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with intact enzyme defect or hyper@@ ammon@@ ia @-@ mic en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage as a result of high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
&quot; amp@@ on@@ aps - split by several individual doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed with food or administered via a gastro@@ intestinal tube ( through the stomach in the stomach of leading tube ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach of leading tube ) . &quot;
&quot; it was not a comparative study , as Am@@ mon@@ aps could not be compared with another treatment or with placebo ( a placebo group , i.e. without active substance ) . &quot;
&quot; may also result in loss of appetite , abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , f@@ ain@@ ting , fluid retention , abdominal pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , skin rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that am@@ on@@ aps in patients with disturbances of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevented high ammon@@ ia values .
&quot; am@@ on@@ aps were approved under &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; , &quot; because due to the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of admission only limited information about this medicine was presented . &quot;
the use is indicated in all patients where a complete enzyme deficiency has already been manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ manifest form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which mani@@ fests itself after the first month of life ) , there is an indication of the use when there is a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; for infants , for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients suffering from swal@@ lowing , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form . &quot;
&quot; the daily dose is calculated individually , taking into account the protein intoler@@ ance and the daily protein up@@ take of the patient . &quot;
&quot; according to the previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose is sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 to 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day for children with a body weight of more than 20 kg and adolescents and adults . &quot;
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Car@@ bam@@ bis@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine in@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e .
&quot; ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0,@@ 4 - 0,@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8,@@ 8 - 15,@@ 4 g / m ² / day must be received . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be administered to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , as there is a risk of the emergence of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately enter the stomach . &quot;
&quot; each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used only with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , as well as with sodium retention and dem@@ es@@ formation . &quot;
&quot; since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate over the liver and kidneys occur , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be used only with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure . &quot;
the importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; in sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats at high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , there was a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal propag@@ ation and increased loss of neur@@ ons . &quot;
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a decreased number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thereby a disability of brain growth .
it could not be as@@ cer@@ tained whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in humans into breast milk and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during breast@@ feeding ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , at least one un@@ desirable event ( AU ) occurred at 56 % of the patients and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS . &quot;
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ect@@ al patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ tate , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , arm@@ our top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of over@@ dose occurred in a 5 @-@ month @-@ old infant with an accidental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms begin with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in intraven@@ ous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active compound that con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine which is ex@@ cre@@ ted through the kidneys .
&quot; omet@@ ri@@ cally , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen . &quot;
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be thought that sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
it is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival chances and clinical outcome .
&quot; the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ au@@ st , and the disease itself led to death even in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids , or with their nitrogen @-@ free analog@@ a within the first year of life . &quot;
&quot; by hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the utilization of alternative ways of nit@@ ric ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns in post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first life @-@ month ) to 80 % . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and which were previously treated before the first occurrence of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it came with time with many to mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ otic form of the or@@ ni@@ thine in@@ scar@@ let defect ) , which were treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and a protein @-@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % . &quot;
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible for treatment and in some patients further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition may occur .
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated to glut@@ amine in liver and kidneys , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine . &quot;
&quot; the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined after a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in metabolism and repeated gifts from oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( non @-@ controlled studies ) . &quot;
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and its metabol@@ ites was also investigated in cancer patients following intraven@@ ous administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in tablet form 15 minutes after in@@ gest@@ ing meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate were detected .
&quot; in the majority of patients with ure@@ a @-@ cycli@@ c disturbances or ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) could not be detected in the plasma after a ni@@ gh@@ tly fast . &quot;
&quot; in three out of six patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis treated repeatedly with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma level were five times higher than after the first gifts . &quot;
secre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine over the kidneys .
&quot; according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate did not have a complaint with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( examination 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ules are taken or@@ ally ( babies and children who can not swallow tablets yet , or give patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or via a gastro@@ intestinal tube or a nas@@ al probe . &quot;
&quot; according to the previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 to 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day for children with a body weight of more than 20 kg and adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range . &quot;
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Car@@ bam@@ bis@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine in@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e .
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5.4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; when rat @-@ fl@@ utes were exposed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ) before the birth , lesi@@ ons in the pyr@@ ami@@ ds of the brain rin@@ ds occurred . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ect@@ al patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ tate , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , arm@@ our top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
&quot; omet@@ ri@@ cally , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess fat &quot;
on the basis of investigations on ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disturbances of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that for each gram they can be produced sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
&quot; already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible , and in some patients further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition may occur . &quot;
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in gran@@ ular form 15 minutes after in@@ gest@@ ing meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate were detected .
&quot; during the period of durability , the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; this procedure includes the small measuring spoon 0,@@ 95 g , the medium measuring spoon 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has to receive the medication via a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate amounts to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accumulate in the body after eating proteins in the body . &quot;
&quot; if laboratory tests are carried out , you must notify the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate may affect the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; if you take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
&quot; during breast@@ feeding , you are not allowed to take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS since the medicine can pass into breast milk and harm your baby . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases confusion , head@@ aches , taste disorders , detection of the ear , dis@@ orientation , memory disorders and a deterioration of existing neuro@@ logical conditions have also been observed . &quot;
&quot; if you notice any of these symptoms , contact your doctor or your hospital &apos;s emergency room for initiation of an appropriate treatment . &quot;
&quot; if you forget the intake of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal . &quot;
&quot; changes in the blood count ( red blood cells , white blood cells , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes ) , decreased appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , f@@ ain@@ ting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , unpleasant skin smell , rash , kidney function disorders , weight gain and abnormal laboratory values . &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed adverse events affect you significantly or you notice any side effects that are not specified in this information .
&quot; after the exp@@ ir@@ ation date , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can no longer be used after the exp@@ ir@@ ation date specified on the cart@@ on and the container . &quot;
&quot; as AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS looks and contents of the pack AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets are of whi@@ tish color and oval shape , and they are provided with the embos@@ sing &quot; &quot; U@@ C@@ Y 500 &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; 30 If laboratory tests are carried out , you must notify the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate may affect the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; if you take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS on the same single doses or@@ ally or via a ga@@ stri@@ c ( tube that runs directly into the stomach via the stomach wall ) or a nas@@ al probe ( tube that is fed through the nose into the stomach ) .
&quot; 31 • Rem@@ ove from the tank a he@@ aped measuring spoon gran@@ ulate . • Ke@@ ep a straight edge , e.g. a knife back over the top edge of the measuring spoon to remove excess gran@@ ulate . • The quantity remaining in the measuring spoon corresponds to a measuring spoon . • Take the recommended number of measuring spo@@ ons gran@@ ules out of the tank . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox is used for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example in unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; stress &quot; ( an abnormal measurement value of the electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) . &quot;
&quot; if angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients undergoing a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can help in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of AC@@ S , in which the effect of angi@@ ox was compared with a single dose or in conjunction with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another medicine for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) with the conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI . &quot;
&quot; during the PCI , the patient often used a st@@ ent ( a short tube remaining in the ar@@ tery to prevent a closure ) , and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as ci@@ c@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of AC@@ S , angi@@ ox - with or without the administration of G@@ PI - was as effective in the prevention of new events ( deaths , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cular@@ isation ) after 30 days or a year overall as well as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients undergoing a PCI , angi@@ ox in relation to all the indicators was as effective as He@@ par@@ in , except for severe bleeding where it was significantly more effective than He@@ par@@ in . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , other hi@@ ru@@ dine or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used in patients who recently had a hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge , as well as for people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that angi@@ ox in the treatment of AC@@ S and during a PCI is an acceptable replacement for He@@ par@@ in .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted authorisation to the company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd . &quot;
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( unstable Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ ho@@ ist@@ ing inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in case of emergency interventions or if an early intervention is planned .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with AC@@ S is an intraven@@ ous bol@@ us indication of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if the patient is in another follow a PCI , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; according to the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be resum@@ ed for 4 to 12 hours following clinical requirements . &quot;
&quot; immediately before the procedure a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg is administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure . &quot;
the recommended dose of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous bolt of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight and a subsequent intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
&quot; the safety and efficacy of a certain bol@@ us administration of Angi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended , even if a short PCI interference is planned . &quot;
&quot; if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to under 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values , re@@ constitu@@ ent and dil@@ uted drugs should be carefully mixed prior to use and the bol@@ us dose is administered intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe kidney function restriction ( GF@@ R 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subject to a PCI ( whether treated against AC@@ S or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used . &quot;
&quot; if the ACT @-@ value is less than 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg is administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt will check again . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe kidney damage , included in phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which resulted in approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after administration of the Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din @-@ Bol@@ us without dose adjustment at an average 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
&quot; 3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis @-@ based patients , angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
treatment with angi@@ op@@ last@@ y can be initiated 30 minutes after termination of the intraven@@ ous administration of frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after termination of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low @-@ molecular heat .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or other constitu@@ ents or against hi@@ ru@@ dine • active bleeding or hyper@@ tension caused by a distur@@ b@@ ance of the hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis system and / or irre@@ ver@@ sible bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and for di@@ aly@@ sis @-@ based patients
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding especially when Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is administered in combination with another anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; even if in the case of PCI patients under Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din most ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges are present in arter@@ ial pun@@ cture points , patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) may occur everywhere during the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are taking war@@ far@@ in and treated with a bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after setting the treatment with Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din will once again be reached before the treatment existing level . &quot;
&quot; based on the knowledge of the action mechanism of anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants ( he@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tic units ) it can be assumed that these active substances increase the risk of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in the combination of bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tic units or anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis parameters in each case are regularly monitored . &quot;
&quot; the animal experiments are inadequate in relation to the effects of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , de@@ binding or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din alone , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ised to either un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or en@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in both the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din Group and the comparative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years of age were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
heavy ble@@ ed@@ ings were defined according to AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for heavy ble@@ ed@@ ings as in the foot@@ notes of Table 2 .
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in groups with He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ - inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
&quot; AC@@ U@@ ITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ cran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in or hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in levels of ≥ 4 g / dl with well @-@ known hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in level , reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in level ≥ 3 g / dl with known hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in level , reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in levels of ≥ 3 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; further , less frequently observed bleeding loc@@ aliz@@ ations , which occurred with more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) were &quot; other &quot; pun@@ cture points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or throat . &quot;
the following information about side effects are based on data from a clinical trial with a bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI .
&quot; in both the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din Group and the comparative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years of age were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
&quot; the following side effects , which are not listed above , have been reported in practice after extensive use and are grouped according to system organ classes in table 6 . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the treatment with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is immediately broken down and the patient is closely mes@@ hed with regard to signs of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ op@@ last@@ y contains Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bin@@ ocular inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic centre and on the ani@@ on@@ ary region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or to cl@@ ots . &quot;
&quot; the binding of the Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and therefore its effect , is rever@@ sible because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is re@@ generating the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 slowly , thereby re@@ generating the function of the active center of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din had no th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ indu@@ ci@@ zed th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ indu@@ ci@@ zed th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ indu@@ ci@@ zed th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ indu@@ ci@@ zed th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ indu@@ ci@@ zed th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) . &quot;
&quot; in healthy volunteers and in patients , Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din shows a dose and concentration @-@ dependent anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is confirmed by the pro@@ long@@ ation of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT . &quot;
&quot; if a PCI has been performed following the patient , an additional bolt of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg of Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h . &quot;
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study un@@ question@@ able He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S ) in patients with unstable Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST mid@@ locking inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ised to obtain a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before the onset of angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ ization ) or PCI .
&quot; in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients who required angi@@ ography within 72 hours were spread evenly across the 3 arms . &quot;
&quot; approximately 77 % of patients had recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients underwent angi@@ ography within 72 hours . &quot;

clinical studies with a small number of patients provided limited information on the use of angi@@ op@@ last@@ y in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din were evaluated in patients undergoing perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) and in patients with AC@@ S .
it is expected that Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din as Pep@@ tide has a cat@@ abol@@ ism in its amino acids with subsequent re@@ use of the amino acids in the body pool .
the primary metabol@@ ite resulting from the division of the AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 binding of the N @-@ terminal sequence through th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in is not effective due to the loss of its aff@@ inity to the cataly@@ tic center of thro@@ mb@@ in .

&quot; based on conventional safety har@@ mac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity in repeated dose , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity or reproduction toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot be identified as a particular danger to humans . &quot;
the toxic@@ ity in animals in repeated or continuous exposure ( 1 day to 4 weeks in an exposure to the 10 @-@ fa@@ chen of the clinical ste@@ ady state plasma concentration ) was limited to im@@ position pharmac@@ ological effects .
&quot; side effects due to long @-@ term physiological strain as a reaction to non @-@ home@@ ost@@ atic coag@@ ulation were not observed after short @-@ term exposure comparable to that in clinical application , even at very much higher dosage . &quot;

Angi@@ ox is a freeze @-@ dried powder in single dose @-@ 1 @-@ glass bottles of 10 ml which is sealed with a but@@ yl rubber stop@@ per and sealed with a cap made of extru@@ ded aluminium .
5 ml sterile water for injection purposes are given into a pier@@ cing bottle Angi@@ ox and slightly wa@@ xed until everything has completely dissi@@ p@@ ated and the solution is clear .
5 ml are removed from the pier@@ cing bottle and dil@@ uted with 5 % glucose solution for injection or with 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de solution for injection in a total volume of 50 ml to obtain a final concentration of 5@@ mg / ml Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din .
&quot; the owner of the authorisation for the market is correct , the studies and pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance activities mentioned in Version 4 of Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) , as well as any follow @-@ up amendments to the R@@ MP agreed by the CH@@ MP . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline on risk management systems for human medicine , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted at the same time with the next Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot;
• Pati@@ ents with chest pain due to heart disease ( acute cor@@ on@@ ary syn@@ dro@@ mes - AC@@ S ) • Pati@@ ents who are operated on to treat closures in the blood vessels ( angi@@ op@@ last@@ y and / or perc@@ ut@@ aneous Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ angi@@ op@@ last@@ y - PCI ) .
• You are pregnant or suspect you could be pregnant • You intend to become pregnant • You are currently breast@@ feeding .
&quot; no investigations of the effects on the per@@ ver@@ ability and the ability to operate machinery have been carried out , but it is known that the effects of this drug are only short @-@ term . &quot;
&quot; if bleeding occurs , the treatment with Angi@@ ox is canc@@ eled . • Before starting the injection or in@@ fusion , you will inform your doctor about the possible signs of an allergic reaction . &quot;
such reactions are rare ( they occur in less than 1 of 1000 patients treated ) • A particularly careful monitoring is performed if you have a radi@@ otherapy for the vessels that supply the heart with blood ( this treatment is referred to as beta or g@@ amma @-@ bra@@ ch@@ y@@ therapy ) .

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used for the treatment of adults , adolescents and children from six years of age with diabetes that require treatment with insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh or the upper arm or administered as a permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump . &quot;
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose ( sugar ) in the blood or cannot process insulin effectively .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in differs very margin@@ ally from human insulin and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter duration than a short @-@ acting human insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes where the body cannot produce insulin in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged 4 to 17 years .
&quot; in type 2 diabetes , where the body cannot handle insulin effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study of 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
the main indicator for the efficacy was to change the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
&quot; in the first study with type 1 diabetes , after six months decreased by 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin l@@ is@@ pro . &quot;
in adults with type 2 diabetes the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine or any of the other components or in patients suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect blood glucose levels .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH for the transport of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , A@@ pi@@ dra can be applied either in the area of the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh or the delta muscle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous due to continuous in@@ fusion in the area of abdominal bags . &quot;
&quot; due to the reduced glucose availability and reduced insulin metabolism , insulin needs can be reduced in patients with a reduction in liver function . &quot;
&quot; any change of the effect of the effect , the brand ( Her@@ - adju@@ ster ) , the insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc delay , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the production method can result in a change in insulin requirements . &quot;
&quot; 3 An insufficient dosage or the termination of a treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis . these conditions are potentially life threatening . &quot;
the conversion of a patient to another insulin type or an insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may necess@@ itate change of dosage .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the activity profile of the insulin used and can therefore change during the conversion of the treatment schem@@ as .
&quot; the substances that can increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase the inclin@@ ation to hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia belong to oral anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , dis@@ cop@@ yr@@ amide , fi@@ br@@ ate , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ al , sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ate and sul@@ fon@@ amid antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , under the effects of sympath@@ oly@@ tics such as beta @-@ block@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ i@@ din , Gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ din and reserv@@ ist , the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c counter@@ regulation can be weakened or missing . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity did not show any differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine is present in human breast milk , but generally insulin does not occur in breast milk , nor is it resor@@ bed after oral treatment . &quot;
&quot; listed in clinical trials are listed , grouped by system organs and classified according to decreasing frequency of occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; occasionally : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; not known ( frequency based on the available data not estimated ) . &quot;
&quot; cold sweat , cool and pale skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , anxiety , unusual exhaus@@ tion or weakness , confusion , concentration problems , ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness , excessive hun@@ - ger , changes in vision , headache , nausea and pal@@ pit@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy C@@ ed@@ ent to continuously change the injection point inside the injection area , may result in a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy at the injection site . &quot;
&quot; severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with un@@ consciousness can be treated by an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , administered by a correspon@@ dingly trained person , or by intraven@@ ous administration of glucose by a doctor . &quot;
&quot; after glu@@ ing , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes . &quot;
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose intake ( especially skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as the in@@ hibition of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous ga@@ - be from insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in the effect occurs faster and the duration of action is shorter than with a normal male insulin .
&quot; in a study of 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 with type 1 diabetes , insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in in the therapeu@@ tically relevant dosage range from 0,@@ 0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg showed a dispro@@ portion@@ ate glu@@ cos@@ a @-@ lowering effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a lower proportional increase in the glu@@ cos@@ a @-@ lowering effect , just like human insulin . &quot;
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has a twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glu@@ cos@@ ing effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
&quot; the data showed that an application of insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before meals a comparable post @-@ den@@ ounced gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is reached , as with human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal was applied , a better post@@ pran@@ dial control was achieved than with human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; used for 15 minutes after the meal begins , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , as with human normal insulin , which is given 2 mi@@ di gro@@ oves before meals ( see Figure 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine in offering 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before beginning of the meal compared to human normal insulin , which was given 30 minutes before beginning of the meal ( Figure 1A ) as well as compared to human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine in 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after beginning of the meal compared to human nor@@ - mal@@ ine , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1@@ C ) . &quot;
