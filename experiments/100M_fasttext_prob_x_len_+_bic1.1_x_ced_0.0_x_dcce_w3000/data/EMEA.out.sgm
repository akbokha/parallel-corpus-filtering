<seg id="4">"it is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg tablets, 10 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg of melt tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution to intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml)."</seg>
<seg id="5">"B. wirl thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), mistrust and delusion; • Bipolar-I disorder, a mental illness in which patients have manic episodes (periods of anorexia) alternately with periods of normal mood."</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe physical episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for quick control of increased unrest or behavioural disturbances when the oral intake of the medicine is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both diseases, the solution can be used for intake or the melting tablets in patients with difficulties preparing the swallowing of tablets."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in patients who are taking other medications at the same time, which are broken down as well as Abilify, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this impairs the signal transmission between brain cells by" neurotransmitters, "i.e., chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells to one another."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazol probably acts as a "partial agonist" for the receptors for neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripicompole acts like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in less dimensions than the neurotransmitters, in order to activate the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazol contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, thereby reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing its recurrence."</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify to prevent recurrence of symptoms has been studied in three studies over up to a year.</seg>
<seg id="15">"the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, which suffered from increased restlessness, over a period of two hours with a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with haloperidol for 12 weeks, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence, in 160 patients with which the manic symptoms have already been stabilized with Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the effectiveness of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which suffered from increased unrest, compared with that of Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies, the change in the symptoms of patients was examined using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients responding to the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to examine how the body absorbs the melt tablets and the solution to intake (absorbs).</seg>
<seg id="20">"in both studies with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, showed a significantly greater reduction in symptoms of increased unrest than the patients receiving placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify reduced manic symptoms more effectively than placebo in four of the five short-term studies."</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients for up to 74 weeks and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10 or 15 mg doses were also more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased restlessness and were equally effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of Abilify (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (uncontrolled strain), urgency (worsening), headache, blurred vision, headache, blurred vision, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Human Use Committee (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to severe manic episodes in patients who predominantly had manic episodes, and in which the manic episodes were addressing the treatment with Aripiprazole, outweigh the risks."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in addition, the board came to the conclusion that the benefits of the injection solution in rapid control of increased unrest and behavioural disturbances in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar I disorder, if oral therapy is not suitable, outweigh the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in June 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. for the transfer of Abilify within the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who mainly had manic episodes and whose manic episodes responded to the treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">"the recommended starting dose for Abilify amounts to 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day, regardless of meals daily."</seg>
<seg id="30">"increased efficacy in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once a day, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">"in consideration of the greater sensitivity of this group of patients, a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors justify this (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">"if the CYP3A4 is removed from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazizol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the occurrence of suicidal behavior is part of psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after onset or after change of an anti-psychotic therapy, even when treated with Aripiprazol (see Section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no increased risk of suicidal risk with Aripiprazol compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Aripiprazol should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, hypertension, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including akzeleed and maligne form)."</seg>
<seg id="38">"3 Spätdyskinesia: in clinical trials, which lasted one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia arising during the treatment with Aripiprazol."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if there are signs and symptoms of late dyskinesia in a patient treated with Abilify, this should be considered to reduce the dose or to break the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if a patient develops signs and symptoms that point to mns, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be removed."</seg>
<seg id="41">"for this reason, Aripiprazol should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or in conditions associated with seizures."</seg>
<seg id="42">"56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazol in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients treated with Aripiprazol had an increased risk of death compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="43">"however, there was in one of these studies, a study of fixed dosage, a significant relationship between dosage and response for undesirable cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripiprazol."</seg>
<seg id="44">"hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs, including Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no accurate risk estimates for hyperglycemia related adverse events associated with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic drugs to allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">"polydips, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored with regard to impaired glucose levels."</seg>
<seg id="47">"weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar disorder due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications."</seg>
<seg id="48">"due to the primary effect of Aripiprazizol on the central nervous system, caution is advised if Aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective drugs with deriving side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the H2 antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant."</seg>
<seg id="50">"in a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased the AUC of Aripiprazole by 107%, while the CMAx remained unchanged."</seg>
<seg id="51">"it is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and that is why similar dose reductions should be made."</seg>
<seg id="52">"in CYP2D6 'bad' (=" poor ") metabolism, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers."</seg>
<seg id="53">"if you consider the joint gift of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, the potential benefits should outweigh potential risks for the patient."</seg>
<seg id="54">"other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV proteinase inhibitors, are likely to have similar effects and should therefore be made similar dose reductions."</seg>
<seg id="55">"after settling the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of Abilify should be increased to the dose height before the start of the adjuvant therapy."</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be administered with a moderate increase in Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">"in clinical trials, doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazole did not show a significant effect on the metabolites of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextromethorphan / 3-methoxymorphinan-ratio), 2C19 (Omeprazizol) and 3A4 (dextromethorphan)."</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">"due to the insufficient data situation for safety in humans and due to the concerns resulting from reproductive studies at the animal, this drug may not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk for the fetus."</seg>
<seg id="60">"however, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned against using dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazole has no negative influence on them."</seg>

<seg id="69">"a comparison between the patient groups under Aripipraziole and placebo, with potentially clinically significant changes in the routinely controlled laboratory parameters, yielded no medically significant differences."</seg>
<seg id="70">"increases of CPK (creatine phosphate kinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazol compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo."</seg>
<seg id="71">"side effects reported in connection with antipsychotic therapy and the occurrence of treatment with Aripiprazol include the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and varicose cases, unwanted cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="72">"in clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentional or deliberate acute overdosage with Aripiprazol alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg, and without cause of death."</seg>
<seg id="73">"although there is no information on the efficacy of a hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazizol, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is useful in the treatment of an overdose since Aripiprazol has a high plasma binding."</seg>
<seg id="74">It is believed that the efficacy of Aripiprazol in schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder is mediated by the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D and serotonin 5HT1 receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">"in vitro, Aripiprazol showed a high affinity for dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and serotonin 5HT1a and 5HTA receptor as well as a moderate affinity to dopamine D and 5HT7-, alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine-H1receptor."</seg>
<seg id="76">"the Positoline emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, on the Nucleus caudatus and on the putamen."</seg>
<seg id="77">"in three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) of 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazol showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in a half-operniated study, 52% of responder patients attending the study were similar in both groups (Aripiprazl 77% and Haloperating dol 73%) in both groups."</seg>
<seg id="79">"current values from measured scales defined as secondary study goals, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg- Depressive Rate scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement compared to semi-operials."</seg>
<seg id="80">"in a placebo-controlled trial over 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazol showed a significantly higher return rate, which was 34% in the Aripiprazole Group and 57% in placebo."</seg>
<seg id="81">"in an octzapine controlled, multinational double-blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, the 314 patients included in significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7% compared with baseline value (i.e. an increase of at least 5,6 kg at an average weight of ca."</seg>
<seg id="82">"in two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible doses over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazol showed an effective efficacy in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks."</seg>
<seg id="83">"in a placebo-controlled monotherapy study for 3 weeks with fixed dose of patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazol showed no superior efficacy against placebo."</seg>
<seg id="84">"in two placebo and active controlled monotherapy studies for 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms, Aripiprazol showed a efficacy in week 3 and a conservation effect comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12."</seg>
<seg id="85">"in addition, Aripiprazol showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania in week 12, such as lithium or haloperidol."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in a placebo-controlled trial over 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms, which partially did not respond to lithium or valproate monotherapy in therapeutic serum supplementation, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazole yielded superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate."</seg>

<seg id="88">"based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the dehydration and hydroxylic modelling of Aripiprazol, the N-degeneration is catalyzed by CYP3A4."</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean removal time is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazol with extensive metabolisers via CYP2D6 and about 146 hours in 'bad' (= "poor") metabolisers via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">"in Aripiprazol, there are no differences in pharmacokinetic between male and female healthy subjects, as well as in a pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenic patients no gender-dependent effects."</seg>
<seg id="91">A pop-up-specific analysis on pharmacokinetics did not reveal any clinically significant differences in respect to ethnicity or the effect of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazol and Dehydro-Aripiprazol were similar in patients with severe renal insufficiency compared to young healthy subjects.</seg>
<seg id="93">"a single dose study in subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazizol and Dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions to their metabolic capacity."</seg>
<seg id="94">"based on conventional safety harmacology studies, toxicity in repeated administration, reproduction toxicity, genotoxicity and the carcinogenic potential, the preclinical data had no particular danger for humans."</seg>
<seg id="95">"toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or expositions, which clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans, so they have only limited or no importance for clinical use."</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent side kidney toxicity (lipofuscin pigment accumulation and / or parenchycell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3 to 10 times the middle Steady State Exposition (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose at humans.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR to the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) explaining how the Committee for Human Use Medicinal Products (CHMP) has assessed the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (particularly obese patients) where metformin (a diabetes drug) is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="751">It can be used in addition to metformin in patients (particularly obese patients) who cannot be adequately adjusted using metformin alone in the highest tolerated dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">"in combination with a sulfonyresa or insulin, the previous dose of sulfonyresins or insulin can be maintained with the beginning of the Actos treatment, except in patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); this should reduce the dose of sulfonyresins or insulin."</seg>
<seg id="753">"this means that the body's own insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases, making type 2 diabetes better."</seg>
<seg id="754">"in more than 1,400 patients the efficacy of Actos was studied in triple therapy; in addition, patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonyl resin, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years."</seg>
<seg id="755">"in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, indicating how well the blood sugar is set."</seg>
<seg id="756">"Actos led to a decrease in the HbA1c value, which suggests that the blood sugar levels were lowered when using dosages of 15 mg, 30 mg, and 45 mg."</seg>
<seg id="757">"at the end of the Tripletherapy trial, the effect of the additional administration of Actos for the existing treatment with metformin and a sulfonyresin was 0.94%, while the additional administration of placebo led to a decrease of 0.35%."</seg>
<seg id="758">"in a small study where the combination of Actos and insulin was studied in 289 patients, patients receiving Actos in addition to insulin showed a decrease in HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared to 0.14% in patients receiving placebo."</seg>
<seg id="759">"the most common adverse events related to Actos were visual disturbances, upper respiratory tract infections (colds), weight gain and hypoaesthesia (decreased sensitivity to stimuli)."</seg>
<seg id="760">"in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis, Actos may not be used in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketone level - in the blood)."</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in patients where metformin is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="762">"in October 2000, the European Commission granted approval to the company Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited for the transfer of Actos across the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="763">"the tablets are white to whitish, round, vaulted and carry on one side the marking" 15 "and on the other side the inscription" Actos. ""</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and is inappropriate for metformin due to contraindications or intolerance (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">"no data is available for pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age, so the application is not recommended in this age group."</seg>
<seg id="766">"in patients who are endangered by the presence of at least one risk factor (e.g. former heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose stepwise."</seg>
<seg id="767">"patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure, weight gain or oedema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve."</seg>
<seg id="768">"patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure, weight gain and oedema when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin."</seg>
<seg id="769">Cardiovascular Outcome study with pioglitazone in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macular disease has been performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">"in this study, there was an increase in reports of heart failure, which however did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study."</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output liver enzymphs (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">"if ALT levels are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range, the liver enzyme values are to be checked again as soon as possible."</seg>
<seg id="773">"if a patient develops symptoms that point to a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, headaches, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or dark urine, the liver enzyme values must be examined."</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of the patient with pioglitazone should be continued until the end of the laboratory parameters should be conducted by the clinical evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="775">"in clinical trials with pioglitazone, a dose-dependent weight gain has been proven, which can be caused by fat deposits and in some cases associated with fluid retention."</seg>
<seg id="776">A minor reduction of mean haemoglobin values (relative reduction by 4%) and haematocrits (relative reduction by 4.1%) appeared under therapy with pioglitazon.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in compare controlled studies with pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 3-4% and hematocrits by 1-2% and haematocrits by 1-2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">"as a result of increased insulin sensitivity, in patients who receive pioglitazone as oral two or triple combination therapy with a sulfonyresa or as a two-fold combination therapy with insulin, the risk of dose-dependent hypoglycemia."</seg>
<seg id="779">"after the introduction of the treatment with thiazoldindiae, including pioglitazone, a occurrence or worsening of diabetic macular edema was reported with a decrease in visual acuity."</seg>
<seg id="780">"it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pioglitazone and the occurrence of macular edema, but arranging doctors should be aware of the possibility of a macular edema when patients report about disturbances of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmological examination should be taken into consideration."</seg>
<seg id="781">"in a summary analysis of adverse events concerning fractures from randomised controlled, controlled, double-blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone"</seg>
<seg id="782">"the estimated fracture incidence was 1,9 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication."</seg>
<seg id="783">"in the ProActive Study, a study of more than 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5,1%; 1,0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with pioglitazone, compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication."</seg>
<seg id="784">"patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy, and if a patient wishes to be pregnant or she is pregnant, the treatment should be cancelled (see section 4.6)."</seg>
<seg id="785">"studies investigating the interactions have shown that pioglitazone does not exert any relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics or drug dynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin."</seg>
<seg id="786">"interactions with medicines that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reductinhibitors are not expected."</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous use of Pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a Cytochrom P450 2C8 inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the AUC of pioglitazone by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous use of pioglitazone with Rifampicin (a Cytochrom P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a reduction in the AUC of pioglitazon by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that under treatment with pioglitazone the hyperinsulin sensitivity and increased insulin resistance of the uterus reduce the availability of the metabolic substrates for the fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">"very frequently &gt; 1 / 10; frequent &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; occasionally &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 10000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (not estimated from present data)."</seg>
<seg id="791">"these lead to a temporary change in the turgor and the index of the lens, as observed in other hypoglycaemic agents."</seg>
<seg id="792">"in clinical trials with pioglitazone, ALT ascents performed beyond three times the upper limit of the standard range as often as placebo, but less often than in comparison groups under Metformine or Sulfonyresnstoff."</seg>
<seg id="793">"in an outcome study in patients with pre-existing advanced macular disease, the incidence of severe heart failure under pioglitazone was 1.6% higher than under placebo when Pioglitazone or Pioglitazone respectively."</seg>
<seg id="794">"since its launch, it has rarely been reported about heart failure under pioglitazon, but more often when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in anamnesis."</seg>
<seg id="795">"a summary analysis of adverse events concerning bone fractures from randomised controlled, controlled, double blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in the groups treated with pioglitazone and over 7,400 patients were conducted in the treated groups."</seg>
<seg id="796">"over a period of 3.5 years of ProActive study, Fraktures performed in 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with pioglitazone, compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparative medication."</seg>
<seg id="797">"when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day for four days, then 180 mg / day for seven days no symptoms appeared."</seg>
<seg id="798">"pioglitazone seems to function via activation of specific receptors (Peroxisome Proliferator) activated Receptor-γ (PPAR-γ), leading to increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells."</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that pioglitazone reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose degradation in case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with pioglitazone versus Gliclagellas monotherapy was continued for over two years to investigate the time until the therapeutic effect was left (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">"at the time after two years after the treatment, blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) could be maintained by pioglitazone in 69% of the treated patients (compared to 50% of the patients under Gliclacide)."</seg>
<seg id="802">"in a placebo-controlled trial for more than 12 months, patients whose blood sugar had been adequately prepared with insulin despite three months of optimization were randomised to Pioglitazone or placebo."</seg>
<seg id="803">"in patients under pioglitazone, the mean HbA1c was reduced by 0.45%, compared with the patients who continue to receive insulin; a reduction of insulin dosage in the group treated with pioglitazone was observed."</seg>
<seg id="804">"in clinical trials over a year, a statistically significant decrease in albumin / creatinine quotients showed a statistically significant decrease of albumin / creatinine quotients compared to the initial values."</seg>
<seg id="805">"the effect of pioglitazone (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, 18 week study of type 2 diabetics."</seg>
<seg id="806">"in most clinical trials comparing to placebo a reduction of the overall plasma triglyceride and the free fatty acids and an increase in HDL- cholesterol levels as well as slightly, but clinically not significantly increased LDL- cholesterol levels were observed."</seg>
<seg id="807">"in clinical trials over a period of up to two years, pioglitazone reduced total plastic matrices and free fatty acids in comparison to placebo, metformin or Gliclagens and increased the HDL cholesterol level."</seg>
<seg id="808">"compared to placebo, no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol was observed under pioglitazon, while values decreased among metformin and Gliclagens."</seg>
<seg id="809">"in a study for 20 weeks, pioglitazone reduced not only the chandeliers triglycerides, but also improved the postprandial high triglyceride levels, which have an effect on triglyceride absorption as well as the hepatic triglyceride synthesis."</seg>
<seg id="810">"in the ProActive study, cardiovascular outcomes, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macular disease were randomised to receive either pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years."</seg>
<seg id="811">"after oral application, pioglitazone is absorbed quickly, with the highest concentrations of immutable Pioglitazone in the plasma usually 2 hours after application."</seg>
<seg id="812">"on this basis, the contribution of M-IV corresponds to the effectiveness of the efficacy of pioglitazone, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal."</seg>
<seg id="813">"in interaction studies, it has been proven that pioglitazone exerts no relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics or drug dynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin."</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous use of Pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a Cytochrom P450 2C8 Inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a Cytochrom P450 2C8 inductor) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">"after the oral application of radioactively marked pioglitazon in humans, the marker was found mainly in rotting (55%) and to a lesser extent in the urine (45%)."</seg>
<seg id="816">"the mean plasma elimination of immutable pioglitazon is 5-6 hours in humans, and the total active metabolism is 16 - 23 hours."</seg>
<seg id="817">"plasma concentrations of pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects, but the rates of oral clearing of the mother substance are similar."</seg>
<seg id="818">"in toxicological studies, mice, rats, dogs and monkeys were consistent after repeated administration of plasma volume magnification with hemodilution, anemia and reversible eccentric heart hypertrophy."</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that under treatment with pioglitazone the hyperinsulin sensitivity associated with the gestation decreases and increased insulin resistance of the uterus and thereby reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for the fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) the rat induces increased incidence of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) of the urethra epithelium.</seg>

<seg id="827">"in a study for 20 weeks, pioglitazone reduced not only the chandeliers triglycerides, but also improved the postprandial high triglyceride levels, which both have an effect on the glyceride absorption as well as the hepatic Tryglizeride synthesis."</seg>
<seg id="828">"although the study lacked the objective of its primary endpoint, which presented a combination of total mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary artery, coronary revascularisation and revascularisation of the leg arteries, the results suggest that the intake of pioglitazone does not involve cardiovascular long-term risks."</seg>

<seg id="2040">No low dose was given at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one (78%) or two (42%) of NRTIs together with agenera.</seg>

<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg) and leaves a large distribution volume as well as an unobstructed penetration of amonavir from the bloodstream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma, with the amount of unbound amonavir representing the active portion probably remains unchanged."</seg>

<seg id="2053">"the renal Clearance of Ritonavir is also negligible, so the effect of a renal dysfunction may be limited to the elimination of amonavir and kritonavir."</seg>

<seg id="2660">"in June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) approved a negative report, in which the authorisation of the treatment of the medicines prescribed for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended for the treatment of Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution."</seg>
<seg id="2661">"this means that Alpheon should resemble a biological drug called Roferon-A with the same drug-like ingredient that is already approved in the EU (also called" "reference drug" ")."</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (a liver disease caused by viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in a microscopic examination the liver tissue has damage, and the values of the liver enzyme Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) are increased in the blood standard."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"it is produced by a yeast produced by a gene (DNA), which stimulates the metabolism of the active substance."</seg>
<seg id="2665">"alpheon producer submitted data that demonstrate the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (substance structure, composition and purity of the medicine, mode of action, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C)."</seg>
<seg id="2666">"in the study of patients with hepatitis C, the efficacy of Alpheon was compared with the efficacy of the reference drug in 455 patients."</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study measured how many patients after 12 of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after setting the treatment responded to the drug (i.e. no signs of virus in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">"furthermore, concerns have been expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed will not be sufficient."</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of hepatitis C patients who responded to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"after the treatment with Alpheon, the disease again retarded to more patients than with the reference drug. moreover, Alpheon had more side effects."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"apart from this, the test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the drug is an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug), is not adequately validated."</seg>
<seg id="2673">"it can be used for the treatment of impetigo (a skin infection associated with crust formation) and small infected infirmations (cracking or cutting wounds), abrasions and sewn wounds."</seg>
<seg id="2674">"Altargo should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or probably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), because Alargo may not affect this type of infections."</seg>
<seg id="2675">"Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under the age of 18, the skin area to be treated may not exceed 2% of the body surface."</seg>
<seg id="2676">"if the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments."</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced) and inhibits the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients with placebo matched the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">"in the treatment of infected skin wound, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: if the results of both studies were taken together at skin wound, approximately 90% of both groups responded to the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="2681">"however, in these two studies, however, Altargo was not effective enough when treating abscesses (freezing cavities in the body tissue) or infections caused by MRSA."</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is an irritation at the order.</seg>
<seg id="2683">"the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo outweigh the risks in the short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections: • Impetigo, • infected small infirmations, abrasions or sewn wounds."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in May 2007, the European Commission granted approval to the company Glaxo Group Ltd. a permit for the transfer of Altargo throughout the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">"in the case of sensitization or severe local irritation by the use of retapamulin sage, the treatment is canceled, the ointment is carefully wiped off and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection has begun."</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin should not be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known as pathogen or is suspected (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">"in clinical trials of secondary infected open wounds, the efficacy of retinapamulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)."</seg>
<seg id="2689">Alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2 to 3-day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected place occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of the simultaneous use of reapamulin and other topical remedies on the same skin area has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">"due to the low plasma concentrations, which were achieved in humans after topical application on skimpy skin or infected superficial wounds, a clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not expected (see section 5.2)."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg of ketoconazole, the mean Retapamulin AUC (0-24) and CMAX were increased by 81% after topical application of 1% retapamulin ointment on decreased skin of healthy adult men."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"due to the low systemic exposure to topical use in patients, dose adjustments are not considered necessary when topical reapamulin is used during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors."</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral consumption and are inadequate in relation to a statement on the birth and fetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Reapamulin ointment should only be used during pregnancy if topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of reapamulin is preferable to the administration of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">Deciding whether breastfeeding continues / ends or the treatment with Altargo should be continued / terminated is to weigh between the benefit of breastfeeding for the infant and the benefit of the altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">"in clinical trials of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, which have applied Altargo, was the most commonly reported side effect irritation at the place of performance, which concerned about 1% of the patients."</seg>
<seg id="2698">"retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus)."</seg>
<seg id="2699">The active mechanism of Retapamulin depends on the selective inhibition of the bacterial protein synthesis through interaction at a specific binding site of the 50s subunit of the bacterial ribosome that differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the binding site is involved in the ribosomal protein L3 and is located in the region of the ribosomal P-Bindentation Centre and the Peptidyltransferase Centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">"by binding on this binding site, Pleuromutiline inhibits the peptidy transfer, block partial P-binding interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s-ribosomal subunits."</seg>
<seg id="2702">"should, due to the local prevalence of resistance the application of retinosamulin seems questionable at least some forms of infection, a consultation should be sought by experts."</seg>
<seg id="2703">"no differences in the in-vitro activity of retinosamulin was detected opposite S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin."</seg>
<seg id="2704">"in case of non-response to treatment with S.aureus, the presence of strains with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered."</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults 1% retapamulin ointment was applied daily under occlusion on intact skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">"of 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% retapamulin sage twice a day for 5 days for topical treatment of secondarily infected traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained."</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling took place on days 3 or 4 in adult patients before the medication and in the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">"however, the maximum individual systemic absorption on humans after topical application of 1% ointment to 200 cm2 of decreased skin (CMAx = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660 times lower than the retinosamulin IC50 for PGP inhibiting."</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of retinapamulin in human liver microbes was primarily mediated by CYP3A4 and lower participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">"in studies on oral toxicity of rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were performed over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes."</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro examination of gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse-lymphoma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in rats-microkerntest for in-vivo investigation of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">"there was neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility in oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, which has been achieved up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure in humans (topical application on 200 cm2 of skimpy skin):"</seg>

<seg id="2714">"the owner of the approval for the inverter must ensure that a pharmacovigilance system, as presented in module 1.8.1 of the authorisation application (version 6.2), is present and works before the product is marketed and as long as the marketing product is marketed."</seg>
<seg id="2715">"the owner of the authorisation for the market is obliged to conduct detailed studies and additional pharmacovigilance activities in the pharmacovigilance plan as described in Version 1 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP), as well as all additional updates of the RMP agreed with the CHMP."</seg>

<seg id="2723">"ambient rix is used for the protection against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged between 1 and 15 years, which are not immune to these two diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2724">"ambient rix is used as part of a vaccination plan consisting of two doses, and a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered."</seg>
<seg id="2725">"for this reason, Ambirix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during the immunization and it is ensured that the vaccination of two doses can be completed."</seg>
<seg id="2726">"if a refresher dose is desired against hepatitis A or B, Ambirix or any other hepatitis B or B vaccine can be given."</seg>
<seg id="2727">"vaccines work by" "teach" "the immune system (the natural defences of the body), as it can fight against a disease."</seg>
<seg id="2728">"after a child has received the vaccine, the immune system detects viruses and surface antigens as" foreign "and produces antibodies against it."</seg>
<seg id="2729">"Ambirix contains the same ingredients as the vaccine, which has been approved since 1996 and has been approved since 1997."</seg>
<seg id="2730">"the three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, however, Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are administered as part of an existing vaccination plan consisting of three doses."</seg>
<seg id="2731">"because Ambirix and Twinrix adult contain identical ingredients, some of the data that support the use of Twinrix adult were also used as evidence of the application of Ambirix."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"the main indicator of the efficacy was the share of vaccinated children, which had developed a protective antibody concentrations one month after the last injections."</seg>
<seg id="2733">"in an additional study with 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six month and a 12 month gap between the two injections."</seg>
<seg id="2734">"in between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children, Ambirix performed a month after the last injections for the development of protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B."</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambirix was similar at a six-month gap between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">"the most common side effects of Ambienta (observed with more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, lack of appetite, pain at the injection point, redness, maturation (fatigue) as well as irritability."</seg>
<seg id="2737">"ambitions may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other components or neomycin (an antibiotic)."</seg>
<seg id="2738">"in August 2002, the European Commission granted GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals to the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals."</seg>
<seg id="2739">"the standardization plan for basic dimmization with Ambirix consists of two doses, the first dose is administered at the date of the choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose."</seg>
<seg id="2740">Vaccination for hepatitis A and hepatitis B can be vaccinated with the appropriate monovalent vaccines or with a combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) antibody levels are the same size as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">"it is not yet fully assured whether immunocompetent persons who have responded to hepatitis C vaccination, need a refresher vaccination as protection, since they may also be protected by immunological memory even in cases of no longer detectable antibodies."</seg>
<seg id="2743">"3 As with all injection-vaccines, appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately for the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction after the injection of the vaccine."</seg>
<seg id="2744">"if a quick protection against hepatitis B is required, the standard vaccine is recommended with the combination vaccine that contains 360 ELISA-units formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen."</seg>
<seg id="2745">"in the case of hemodialysis patients and persons with immune system disorders, there may be no adequate anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibody value after primer injury, so that in these cases further vaccines may be required."</seg>
<seg id="2746">"since an intradermal injection or intramuscular administration could lead to a suboptimal outcome in the gluteal muscles, these injection methods should be avoided."</seg>
<seg id="2747">"however, in cases of thrombocytopenia or coagulation disorders, ambient light can be injected subcutaneous as in these cases, after intramuscular gift to bleeding can occur."</seg>
<seg id="2748">"if Ambirix was given in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection simultaneously with a combined diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussi, inactivated poliomyelitis and Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine, the immune response was sufficient for all antigens (see section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects it must be assumed that no adequate immune response is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2750">"in a clinical trial conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, maturation, gastroenteritis, headache and fever was similar to the frequency observed in previous Thiomerang and preservative-containing vaccine formulation."</seg>

<seg id="2757">The frequency of pronounced pain and maturation was low and comparable to that observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3-dose vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">"in a comparative study of 1 to 11 years old vaccines, the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the ambient group was similar to that observed in administration with the 3-dose-combination vaccine with 360 ELISA-units of formalininactivated hepatitis B and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen."</seg>
<seg id="2759">"in the 6- to 11-year-olds, however, after vaccination with Ambirix a frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not per proband, was reported."</seg>

<seg id="2767">"in people aged between 12 and 15 years old, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies could be proven for at least 24 months after immunization with Ambienta in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme."</seg>

<seg id="2965">"Apidra is used for the treatment of adults, adolescents and children from six years of age with diabetes that require treatment with insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"Apidra is injected subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thigh or the upper arm or administered as a permanent infusion with an insulin pump."</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose (sugar) in the blood or cannot process insulin effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lulisin differs very marginally from human insulin and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter duration than a short-acting human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra has been studied in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes where the body cannot produce insulin in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged 4 to 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">"in type 2 diabetes, where the body cannot handle insulin effectively, Apidra was examined in a study of 878 adults."</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator for the efficacy was to change the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">"in the first study with type 1 diabetes, after six months decreased by 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) compared to a decrease of 0.14% in insulin lispro."</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes the HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months compared to 0.30% in human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin-lulisine or any of the other components or in patients suffering from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"in September 2004, the European Commission granted approval to the company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH for the transport of Apidra in the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"as subcutaneous injection, Apidra can be applied either in the area of the abdominal wall, the thigh or the delta muscle or subcutaneous due to continuous infusion in the area of abdominal bags."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"due to the reduced glucose availability and reduced insulin metabolism, insulin needs can be reduced in patients with a reduction in liver function."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"any change of the effect of the effect, the brand (Her- adjuster), the insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc delay, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the production method can result in a change in insulin requirements."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"3 An insufficient dosage or the termination of a treatment, especially in patients with insulin-based diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis. these conditions are potentially life threatening."</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of a patient to another insulin type or an insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may necessitate change of dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycemia depends on the activity profile of the insulin used and can therefore change during the conversion of the treatment schemas.</seg>
<seg id="2983">"the substances that can increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase the inclination to hypoglycaemia belong to oral antidiabetic, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, discopyramide, fibrate, fluoxetine, propoxyphal, salicylate and sulfonamid antibiotics."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"in addition, under the effects of sympatholytics such as beta-blockers, Clonidin, Guanethidin and reservist, the symptoms of adrenergic counterregulation can be weakened or missing."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"experimental studies on reproductive toxicity did not show any differences between insu- linglulisin and human insulin in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"it is not known whether insulin lulisine is present in human breast milk, but generally insulin does not occur in breast milk, nor is it resorbed after oral treatment."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"listed in clinical trials are listed, grouped by system organs and classified according to decreasing frequency of occurrence (very common: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 1,000; occasionally: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; not known (frequency based on the available data not estimated)."</seg>

<seg id="2989">"lipodystrophy Cedent to continuously change the injection point inside the injection area, may result in a lipodystrophy at the injection site."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"severe hypoglycemias with unconsciousness can be treated by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg), administered by a correspondingly trained person, or by intravenous administration of glucose by a doctor."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"after gluing, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypoglycemia and to avoid similar episodes."</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose intake (especially skeletal muscles and fat) as well as the inhibition of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in subcutaneous ga- be from insulin-lulisin the effect occurs faster and the duration of action is shorter than with a normal male insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">"in a study of 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 with type 1 diabetes, insulin-lulisin in the therapeutically relevant dosage range from 0,075 to 0.15 E / kg showed a disproportionate glucosa-lowering effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a lower proportional increase in the glucosa-lowering effect, just like human insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisin has a twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glucosing effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">"the data showed that an application of insulin-lulisin 2 minutes before meals a comparable post-denounced glycaemic control is reached, as with human normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"insulin lulisin 2 minutes before the meal was applied, a better postprandial control was achieved than with human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"used for 15 minutes after the meal begins, a comparable glycaemic control is achieved, as with human normal insulin, which is given 2 midi grooves before meals (see Figure 1)."</seg>
