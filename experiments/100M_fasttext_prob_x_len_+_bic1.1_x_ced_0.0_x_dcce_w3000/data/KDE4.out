the module web page can be found in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; translate menu under Extras Website . from the drop @-@ down list select the starting and target language of the translation .
&quot; if a part of the text is selected , only this part will be translated in place of the whole &amp; URL . &quot;
machine translation is only very ru@@ di@@ mentary . bab@@ el@@ fish produces in the best case a rough translation and in the worst case non@@ sense .
&quot; only web@@ pages on the Internet can be translated . other texts should be translated into the Bab@@ el@@ fish page itself , where you can paste texts directly . &quot;
&quot; package &amp; package ; contains different modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite their small size , they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them easier to access . &quot;
more information about the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
&quot; to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Settings add @-@ ons .... Open the card card tools and select the desired modules . &quot;
this is a list of standard setup modules from the k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that maybe more modules are on your system if you have additional software installed .
&quot; you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , which &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package . &quot;
&quot; to use the crash module , click in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on Tools Canc@@ el . then you can view the page that has brought &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or delete the list of crashes if present . &quot;
the module An@@ ted Filter ( also called Fol@@ der Filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras address filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; it &apos;s up @-@ to @-@ date working directory in different ways .
&quot; to use DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with DO@@ M of the currently displayed web page . as default , the display starts with the root node of the document , for example : document@@ elements , all other no@@ des are sub @-@ elements of this root node . &quot;
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides a further view of objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory on local files . it can be used as an alternative to the various symbol and text views in order to view the contents of your local fil@@ esystem .
&quot; the special feature of &amp; FS@@ View is to graphi@@ cally display ne@@ sted folders hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called tree map . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must have the property , that the sum of the sizes of the child objects is smaller or equal to the size of the object . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; FS@@ View ; the size of a file or folder shows the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries in it . in this way , large files can be easily recognized when they are far down in the folder hierarchy . therefore , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX command you can be considered . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View ; an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap representation is a rect@@ angle that represents a file or folder in your file system . for easier navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles have meaningful color and labelling settings . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rect@@ angle that is switched over view color mode can represent either depth for the easy detection of the ne@@ sting depth or the illustration of another file property , such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type . &quot;
&quot; a rect@@ angle can be labeled with the various properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each feature , you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only if there is enough space to display or if the area of child @-@ related rec@@ tan@@ gles should be used ( whereby the display error may be caused by restrictions in the character of the Tre@@ em@@ ap ) . furthermore , you can set the relative position of the cap@@ tion in the rect@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; in the case of representation algorithms for tre@@ em@@ aps , the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . in the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this goal is not always respected . &quot;
&quot; the allocation of the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries remains up to the implementation . in this case it is easy to divide the areas in such a way that rec@@ tan@@ gles are created , which are as square as possible . the best methods in this regard are lines , columns or recur@@ sive divisions . &quot;
&quot; you can set the minim@@ ally displayed area for an entry on the menu entry View View@@ ing of Area . instead , a space pattern is drawn into the area of the superior entry in order to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry . &quot;
&quot; originally it was &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ get , which was developed for the application K@@ C@@ ach@@ egr@@ ind . &quot;
the module picture gallery can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras picture gallery ... or with C@@ trl ; I .
&quot; when you visit the Picture Gallery module , a dialog opens with which you can set the appearance of the gallery . &quot;
the Tit@@ le of the page allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery page in a text box .
the option images per line has a slider and a rotation field to set the number of mini images of each line in the gallery .
display the file name of the image with the check box . see if the fil@@ en@@ ames are shown under the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
&quot; with the check box file size of the image , specify if the file size is shown below the thumb@@ nails in the gallery . &quot;
with the image size check box you can indicate whether the size of the pictures is shown below the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
&quot; in the dialog folder , you specify where the gallery is stored and which sub@@ folders should be included . &quot;
&quot; in the file choos@@ er saving in HTML file , specify where to save the HTML page . &quot;
&quot; with the check box sub@@ folder , you can set the sub@@ folder with a slider or a rotation pad to which level the sub@@ folders are included . &quot;
&quot; with the original pictures of the check box , you can copy whether the original pictures should be copied to the gallery . &quot;
&quot; using the comment file check box , you can specify a comment file for the cap@@ tion of images in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; in the check box sel@@ e color depth , you can set a different color depth for the thumb@@ nails than in the original pictures . &quot;
the module &amp; HTML ; settings offers easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ;
the module &amp; HTML ; settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras HTML Settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :
the media playback for the navigation pane can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Windows navigation pane or with the keyboard short@@ cut F@@ 9 .
&quot; to play , click in the navigation pane of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and drag the music files you want to listen to in the media playback . &quot;
&quot; change browser detection adds a menu entry in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , which allows you to change browser and operating system identi@@ fier for individual domains . this is useful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers . &quot;
&quot; the standard browser detection of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; is Mozilla / 5.0 ( compatible ; Con@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ eck@@ o ) . if you come to a web page that refuses to access this browser , change browser identification to one of the following options . &quot;
&quot; change the code in M@@ SI@@ E for pages that reject browsers based on Mozilla , for example , you need M@@ SI@@ E browser identification to connect to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; Hot@@ mail . &quot;
pages that do not comply with W3@@ C standards or use their own &amp; HTML ; elements and attributes are correctly displayed using this outdated browser .
&quot; with this option , the default browser identification is used for all pages of the site you are currently viewing . &quot;
with the menu entry ... you can set the scope of the information about the browser used and the operating system in detail .
with this &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; module you can check your &amp; CSS ; -@@ style sheets and &amp; HTML ; documents according to the recommendations of the W3@@ C and other standards .
the module website can be checked in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; check menu under Extras site . you can perform the following ex@@ ams :
&quot; with the &amp; HTML ; check , test if your &amp; HTML ; document of the syntax of &amp; HTML ; comp@@ lies with all found errors . with this review , you can make sure that your pages are displayed correctly by all browsers . &quot;
allows you to review your &amp; CSS ; style sheets embedded in a &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; document . with valid &amp; CSS ; your web pages have a uniform look regardless of the browser used .
&quot; the links on your site will check links and incorrect connections . recur@@ sively , all links on the website are checked . &quot;
here you specify the addresses of the server for checking your &amp; HTML ; -@@ Documents and &amp; CSS ; -@@ style sheets .
with the module Web @-@ Archi@@ vi@@ zer for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; you can save web pages with text and images in .@@ bin format .
&quot; click on the Tools page with the mouse , and a dialog appears to save the displayed web page . &quot;
&quot; the module Web @-@ Archi@@ vi@@ zer is copyright &amp; copy ; 2001 @-@ 2003 Andreas Schl@@ ap@@ bach , Antonio Lar@@ os@@ sa and Mal@@ te Star@@ os@@ tik s@@ p@@ b@@ ch @ i@@ am@@ .@@ uni@@ be@@ .@@ ch lar@@ os@@ sa @ k@@ de@@ .org mal@@ te @ k@@ de@@ .org &quot;
&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface will be provided to you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam . more than 1,000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , every media and card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; you can use them to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . editing capabilities can easily be expanded with K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface ( manual ) modules . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; digi@@ kam ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional skills . it works completely in the 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion via li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC colour management workflow . &quot;
&quot; improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; via the camera or the lens , which can be searched . &quot;
&quot; like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs are also digi@@ kam ; an open source project . that means , it depends on the support of the end @-@ users . therefore , you should report problems and improvements . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialog with an under@@ lined link . if you use this link , your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system . all required information is entered here . just follow the instructions below to send your report . &quot;
&quot; if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam ; if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam ; if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , then we would like to prompt you questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ kam ; but in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful . &quot;
you can also visit the digi@@ cam ; homepage to see news about released versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam ; to learn .
&quot; the best start to participate in &amp; digi@@ kam ; to participate , is the registration in the developer mailing list . instructions for announ@@ cing in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ kam ; . &quot;
&quot; when you launch &amp; digi@@ kam ; for the first time you &apos;ll be asked where you want to save your pictures and your database . you can specify a local , remote or removable folder . simply enter the path name or click the Fol@@ der icon to select a folder . &quot;
&quot; in the second field you have to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data ab@@ n@@ k will be saved . this path remains the same for all folders . &quot;
&quot; later you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ kam , you will additionally use as an Al@@ ben@@ library . &quot;
&quot; if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder that contains pictures , as base folder . &amp; digi@@ kam ; viewed any sub@@ folder as an album . no image will be changed . &quot;
you cannot exclude sub @-@ folders unless it is in hidden folder . you can do this by inser@@ ting a dot in front of the name of the sub@@ folder .
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ liste do not have photos as symbols . you can change them by taking any photo from the album and using it on the folder symbol . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the base folder , you can set up &amp; digi@@ kam ; set up your digital camera . after that , you should learn how to use My Albums and My key@@ wor@@ ths to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; raw file support : if you are using the raw mode of your camera , you can use it . the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to figure out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported rou@@ ters in the Help channel support menu . &quot;
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h @-@ Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h workflow .
&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface will be provided to you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam . more than 1,000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , every media and card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera is then used as a disk drive . the connection can also be realized via Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deri@@ vatives . older cameras may connect the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&quot; g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , distributed software collection for digital cameras that supports an ever increasing number of more than 800 cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol , a widespread protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripher@@ als without the need for additional drivers . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos are generally large files and transfer over the serial port is slow , this connection is now ob@@ sol@@ ete . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link . &quot;
&quot; lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support to reliably read the preview images of digi@@ ti@@ am . if the if support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you may not see thumb@@ nails or the generation could be very slow . &quot;
one of the most beautiful things in &amp; digi@@ kam ; is how easy its functionality can be extended by modules :
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE image plu@@ gins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ kam ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ v@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way as a user can . their advantage is that it is much simpler , &amp; digi@@ kam ; by writing a small module to complement one function , as the changes in &amp; digi@@ kam ; even carry out . &quot;
&quot; to simplify the window , you can either remove pages with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full @-@ screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ trl + Shift + F . &quot;
&quot; moving and dropping images works everywhere : you can store an image in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ edi@@ m , via the horizontal line of partition or to another application window . the only restriction is that one image cannot be stored in keywords , date list or search . &quot;
&quot; - a file type selection allows you to differentiate the most common : JPEG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio &quot;
&quot; the text filter will only be used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view . thus , the filter will work on the fil@@ en@@ ame only if it is displayed in the symbol view . which fields are displayed you can configure in the dialog of the Al@@ ben@@ Settings . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view to your photo albums . all photos stored by &amp; digi@@ kam are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders where they were created on the hard disk , after the name of their collection in the al@@ ben@@ dy properties or after the date the album was first created . &quot;
&quot; if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . you can also select an album to scan images . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album . &quot;
&quot; to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it down . in the then appearing menu you will need to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . you can also move or copy several photos in the same way . simply select all photos and move them to the target album . &quot;
&quot; an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to input information about this collection . to access the album features , right click on the album and select the album title menu in the context menu . &quot;
&quot; album collections : are a method to mark your albums so that you can group under a common name . the collection used by you will be used to sort your photos , when you choose to add or delete new collections . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do this in the settings for collections . &quot;
the album date : is used when you sort your albums by date with viewing albums by date sort .
&quot; buttons el@@ dest , average , new test@@ ers : these put the date on that of the oldest , the latest image or average of the album . to do this , first attempts to calculate the average of the images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , instead the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder . &quot;
&quot; when you first created an album in &amp; digi@@ kam , the first picture in the album will be selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this will help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you may want to select another photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , click the right mouse button and select &quot; &quot; Def@@ ault &quot; &quot; in the pop @-@ up menu . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
an album can only be contained in a collection and collections cannot be ne@@ sted .
the collection includes all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
&quot; the image window provides you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images are displayed in this album in the image window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can customize the size of these preview with the two magni@@ fying buttons in the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; when you open an album for the first time , you have to wait short while the thumb@@ nails are generated . you can avoid this by re@@ generating all thumb@@ nails in the Extras menu . &quot;
&quot; information about each image is displayed below the corresponding preview . what information is , you can change settings digi@@ kam ; set up the albums page and adjust the preview pane to suit your preferences . &quot;
the thumb@@ nails have help window that appear . the help displays the most important features including all the tags of a photo . the screen@@ shot above in the introduction to the main window displays such an help window .
&quot; albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . image editing displays your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to them . you can choose between viewing the images , a slide show or editing pictures . &quot;
you can open the image editing with a photo by using either F@@ 4 image editing ... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and Edit ... select . in the digi@@ kam ; image editing you can see a tutorial on how to edit your photos .
&quot; it can happen that &amp; digi@@ kam ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the sub@@ menu of opening . to do so , and how to customize it to your needs , if your program is not listed , you will find information in &amp; k@@ de ; manual . &quot;
&quot; some programs do not store this data when you save the changed image . thus , this information is lost from EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aperture etc . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest way is to click on the thumb@@ nail to preview and rotate it . in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
&quot; to change the fil@@ en@@ ame of a photo , right click on the preview and select F@@ 2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you will retain the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; if you delete a photo out of &amp; digi@@ kam ; Del@@ ete , it will be moved in the tr@@ ash bin of &amp; k@@ de ; Del@@ ete . F@@ 8 Picture Del@@ ete or Del@@ ete Falls you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del . &quot;
&quot; view &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ am@@ sli@@ ste@@ quot ; organizes your photos by means of the data . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of last modification of the file . &quot;
&quot; if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view so that only the photos of the selected days will be shown to you . &quot;
&quot; tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups . as soon as a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or finding a search . &quot;
&quot; if a keyword is selected , all the photos marked with this keyword will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; keywords can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to lo@@ gically organize your keywords . you can also fold out parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords &apos; , so that you can easily find the keywords that you are looking for . &quot;
&quot; the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , so you can also use your keywords in other programs . &quot;
&quot; you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking on &amp; quot ; My keywords , or click on an existing keyword , and then select a new keyword . if you have cli@@ cked a new keyword , this keyword will be the sub@@ stan@@ tive word of this keyword . &quot;
&quot; you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo . &quot;
&quot; you can change the position of a keyword , drag it to the desired position in the tree and place it there . then a menu appears that gives you the option to move the keyword . a keyword can be at a time only once in the tree . &quot;
you can change the properties of a keyword by right @-@ click and select the keyword in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords .
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , select the image with the right mouse button and select it in the context menu As Alb@@ um@@ preview . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; this can be done in two ways : once you have selected the photos you want with a keyword , you can click on the appropriate keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords . alternatively , you can also right @-@ click on the preview of the pictures and select the keyword from the contex@@ tual menu . &quot;
&quot; you can tag a photo with any number of tags . the photo is displayed as soon as you choose one of the keywords attributed to him . in this way you can specify a keyword for each person in a photo , one for the place where the photo was taken , one for the event where it was made , etc . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided a photo with keywords , it will be displayed in the main window under the preview of the image . &quot;
&quot; you can remove a keyword in which you can open the context menu of the photo with the right mouse button , and select Rem@@ ove from the keywords menu . the menu will show you only the keywords that were assigned to the photo . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline view shows a time @-@ based adjustable hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved over this hist@@ ogram . to select a time frame , you just have to click the lower rect@@ angle of the selection box that indicates the time unit . this will display all associated images in the main window . &quot;
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . it then appears in the list below .
&quot; cover all elements of the database : names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps , and in the future even more . &quot;
&quot; next to the search box , a small lamp is the green when the search hits . if you click here , the filtering is deleted and all pictures are displayed again . if the search has nothing found , then the lamp becomes red . &quot;
&quot; the advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open it , you &apos;ll get a simple search box as described above . however , you can save this search here as a live search , which always filters what you entered as a search criterion . &quot;
&quot; if you are satisfied with your selection , press the head OK and the search will be performed . the results will be displayed in my search list in the main window . if you want to change your choice after searching again , just select the appropriate entry from the View My Search list and select an option in its context menu . &quot;
&quot; if you select to edit the search , the search form will be returned with the previously entered search information . if you select to process advanced search , the dialog will appear for the advanced search to change your previous search . here you will find more rules for the search . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Del@@ ete in the context menu . &quot;
&quot; the Advanced search provides an extended search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ kam ; s database . &quot;
&quot; the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ Database . any option can be added to this list with search group / search group . each option can be added with others through the logical operations All ... , One ... , No ... or at least ... &quot;
&quot; each image is characterized by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows to compare images by comparing these sign@@ atures . the smaller the difference between two image sign@@ atures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot;
&quot; similar entries : this is an area where you can drop every picture to find a similar one . if you push a picture from somewhere over the symbol of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can drop it there . &quot;
sket@@ ch : free hand @-@ drawn sket@@ ch : draw a quick sket@@ ch and &amp; digi@@ kam ; find the right pictures . also here can be a sw@@ ell@@ y@@ worth .
&quot; this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can zoom in or out with the mouse wheel or hold it hold . press C@@ trl , left mouse button to move a square . of course , this requires your pictures to contain ge@@ o data . &quot;
&quot; in the bottom field below , you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a Live Geo@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ kam ; provides a lumin@@ ous table in a separate window with which you can easily compare pictures . it works with all supported image file formats , even raw files . &quot;
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl + L D@@ em Light table from the context menu . the selection will be added to the light table and its window will open .
&quot; from the preview panel , you can drag and drop the images you want to compare to the left or right pane of the window . a small arrow indicates which copy in which window area is to be seen . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of images . if you use combination @-@ wise navigation from the toolbar , then the two first images are automatically loaded into the area for compar@@ isons . use the left mouse button on any thumb@@ nail to view it in the left pane . this simpli@@ fies it through a series of similar pictures . &quot;
&quot; of course , the normal deletion actions also work directly from the light table , such as F@@ 4 file ... &quot;
all picture information from the right side@@ bar of the main window is available for both preview images in the light table . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
&quot; in the lower end of each area you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function , which you can see on the crossed arrows . to keep the visible area of the image , you need to click it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; in the Pre@@ view mode , both images will display the same image area . &quot;
zoom in the same way as in other views . simply use the zoom knob under the images or C@@ trl ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out . this happens in both images when you are in the preview mode .
&quot; digital inventory management views every part of the process as follows after the image has been taken up to final output and permanent storage . each of the photos picks up , scans or stores digital photos performs a form of digital inventory management . most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way . &quot;
&quot; we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to secure your pictures , find , protect and use photos again . we will focus on the procedures for digital photographers who use &amp; digi@@ kam ; we consider downloading , ren@@ aming , backup , reporting , reporting , archiving , waiting and ex@@ porting image files . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Digital stock management takes on , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , sec@@ ures , searches , converts , conf@@ ec@@ tioned and exports content that holds a mon@@ et@@ ar or cultural value . quot ; &quot;
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is defined in accordance with your definition data that provides information about or a documentation of other data managed by an application or environment .
&quot; if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then use not &amp; digi@@ kam ; . the approach to store metadata in a database as well as in the image files guarantees very fast searching and a secure archiving that you can access with other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must be somehow organized on your computer . you have to decide whether other access to your photos should have , whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; you may be happy with this structure . vacation pictures can quickly be found on your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place . if you have enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; then you will be able to export a folder for images that you print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have other requirements , such as version@@ ing of photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of images to different topics and a large number of all . within 10 years 95 % of archives and 5 % working files will have and you will then not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content . &quot;
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived image .
&quot; we also recommend the metadata option in the creation page of the metadata in &amp; digi@@ kam ; to activate . this ensures that EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data are written into the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album menu . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change them ? add &amp; digi@@ kam ; they provide a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones . &quot;
&quot; of course you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value . this makes sense , as you can focus on the best photos when working . &quot;
&quot; now let &apos;s talk to keywords , keywords , as you frequently mean by other programs or continue categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
&quot; if you import cat@@ alo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded keyword , then &amp; digi@@ kam ; automatically build the tree for you or put the images in the right place . the sorting of the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can be easily done by dra@@ gging a sub @-@ tree to another . the changed keywords are checked by &amp; digi@@ kam ; updated while watching the sub@@ trees . &quot;
&quot; the graphic shows how different metadata is overl@@ apping . this is a very rough representation , since each block of metadata is in truth from many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all images . &quot;
&quot; enough of the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata . &quot;
&quot; you want to share your photos with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . you are certainly interested in how your photos arrive . &quot;
&quot; look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a nice beach panorama . if you consider it closer , then start to see some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; wow ! you start to dream of having associations , memories , the historical period is again present , you may even hear the silence . &quot;
&quot; for others who look at your photos , the title may possibly be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transmit it the meaning to the viewer , to help Him through the motive that you have moved to understand what you understand . &quot;
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with an inscription for itself alone .
&quot; with &amp; digi@@ kam ; you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , as cap@@ tion . you can even export it for a selection of images . &quot;
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find a different city without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet in front of Google Earth ? well because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now moves with light speed .
&quot; the possibilities of using ge@@ olo@@ cation are countless and will become even more profound in the future . I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your trips by using images with geographic information . &amp; digi@@ kam . you can also export the photos to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Goo@@ gle@@ Maps viewer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and den@@ otes the practice of using copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same freedoms are also valid in all changed versions , so also for the works of others . &quot;
the following description tells you what information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ kam ; as information should be stored :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to protect the photographer &apos;s name , e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer , the name of a company or organization may not be changed . this field does not support comm@@ as or sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; this field contains the work name of the photographer . examples of this can be titles like : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . &quot;
&quot; if the photographer is working for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here . if the picture is a bearing photo , then the group / agency that offers the picture here is given here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they do not offer protection against mis@@ use . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computers can delete or change these , in the image embedded metadata . for individuals , this protection is very important for the majority of your photos . &quot;
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .
&quot; issues : record errors , record loss , electric impulses , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of the storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , disaster prevention , life time , temperature , data size , spread super@@ sti@@ tion &quot;
&quot; of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or on a fire . these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section you will find problems with the so @-@ called new media . &quot;
&quot; K@@ roll on@@ Track , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics , which causes data loss . &quot;
&quot; of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archi@@ val quality which are longer , harder to get , and much more expensive . there are offers over gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that takes a lifetime of 100 years for itself . whether you believe it lies in your discretion playing room . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD disks can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you can use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write a lot more reliable . &quot;
&quot; CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to errors even if they have just been written . therefore , they use a control check@@ sum mechanism to protect itself . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and control sums . &quot;
&quot; for defective CDs and DVDs , there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that seems to work wonders for CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but it is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications that read damaged disks , hard disks , flash drives , USB drives , etc . &quot;
&quot; optical media : Blu @-@ ray disks seem to capture the format war against HD DVD . a dual layer Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual player DVD with 8,5 GB . &quot;
&quot; do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media . &quot;
&quot; your manufacturer &apos;s warran@@ ts include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the failure mechanisms of hard drives : Dis@@ patch Study &quot;
&quot; electronic parts of the controller are the most common cause of failure , S@@ MA@@ RT can not detect these errors . some errors detected by S@@ MA@@ RT indicate the im@@ minent failure . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years . &quot;
&quot; this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have backed up the files , but these losses can usually be restored without major problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electric devices do not matter too much , the devices with computer chips and high speed processors are different . these can cause serious damage . thus , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause serious short@@ cuts , complete data loss , hardware aging , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . &quot;
&quot; the most widespread protection against power peaks is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs part of the energy heat and gro@@ oves the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in connector , but remember that not every connector bar also contains an over@@ voltage protection . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , you should make sure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . &quot;
&quot; since an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected . this also applies to telephone lines and cable mode@@ ms as well as a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are especially developed for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem . this makes you ideal for on the go . &quot;
&quot; while an over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines , it won &apos;t really help you with a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a break @-@ free power supply . &quot;
&quot; besides the protection against vol@@ tages , these devices can automatically provide cordless power when a power failure occurs . this gives you the possibility to save your data and run down the system . if you buy a US@@ V then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . in addition , the lifetime of the battery and the enclosed software is interesting . &quot;
&quot; consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its security with the costs to avoid this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can cost you up to &amp; euro ; 20 costs , A 500@@ W US@@ V can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can mount it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software . &quot;
&quot; however , you are at home very expensive compared to the hard drives - 40 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data via the comparatively slow Internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are available on photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want your pictures in full resolution online . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of the data security , the web solutions are very safe . transmission errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies are included in the offer a backup and a distributed memory . &quot;
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer . all transfers are prone to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs ensure at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive .
&quot; the worst thing is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred , not if it happened in your hardware . all of these disturbances remain und@@ et@@ ected until you one day you open a photo and this to your surprise is destroyed . it is quite disturbing that there is no protection in your computer . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data route than that in your computer . &quot;
&quot; un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , because they generate inter@@ ferences in data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are not affected by transmission problems at the moment , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of faults per year . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle disk errors on a low level and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GP@@ L in@@ compatible license for Solar@@ is and Leopard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for Linux and Windows . read this article in English . &quot;
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . this is still in alpha status . it uses the same protection mechanisms that Z@@ FS is used and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not yet part of the kernel .
&quot; do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss on not@@ ebook and 46 % on work@@ station systems . in not@@ ebooks , the proportion of th@@ ef@@ ts is 50 % . &quot;
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to lower damage , for example theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; has long been seen no more . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less suscep@@ tible to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most common file systems . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden break during surgery is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . &quot;
&quot; viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aperture pres@@ ets from fundamental physical boundaries . it is meant that while the technology continues to develop there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far from this limit .
even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and a high @-@ quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras . even DSLR cameras have your border at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
&quot; you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not make anybody else responsible for data loss . so , 6 % of all PCs are affected by a data loss each year . so , backup your data often to a plan and test this backup before you do anything dangerous like re@@ installing your operating system , replacing plates or res@@ izing hard drives . &quot;
&quot; suppose you make your back@@ ups on an external SATA drive every day . if , then one day , a flash will have you luck if the drive was not connected at the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster strikes a lot locally and destro@@ ys a lot . don &apos;t forget airplane accidents : fire , water , electricity , children and thi@@ eves are dangerous for your data . they usually concern a whole room or the complete house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , disaster prevention is always a non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as stated above , there is a common reason for loss of data despite securing the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day . &quot;
complete f@@ use : a complete backup of all files that are to be backed up . it is a snapshot without hist@@ ories and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential Backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snapshot at two times : the complete backup and the last differential locking .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . creates multiple snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup was made . this backup comes with a version@@ ing system the next with the exception that it is only abor@@ ted and not continuous .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that were really changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security over s@@ sh .
backup important images directly after you have stored them on your computer on a DVD or other optical media .
&quot; at the same time , you will have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . &quot;
&quot; topic : metadata that saved IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original retained , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ stores images and metadata , copy images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , viewing , ... , use of the Internet . &quot;
&quot; so that valuable pictures survive the next 40 year that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered : &quot;
&quot; since the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you have to consider everything that is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate while time passes . unfortunately , you should ask yourself how the current system is backward . the less variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards supported by many applications .
&quot; virtualization is available for everyone today . so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures , then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the professional expression for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have put the scal@@ ability with you and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . for * ni@@ x systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and reloc@@ ate to a new disk :
&quot; check with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new record has been recognized by the system , but don &apos;t hang it . &quot;
&quot; / dev / s@@ db / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ db , the new disk is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollars ; par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c 0 &amp; lt ; file size works with ext@@ 2.3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and mature &amp; dollars ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # modi@@ fies the size of the disk if necessary &quot;
&quot; open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no more software that can read it , then you can create it yourself . this task will be easier from year to year . &quot;
GIF is a proprietary patented format that slowly disappears from the market . so you should not use it any more .
&quot; P@@ NG is a los@@ s@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 bits per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG can store gam@@ ma@@ - and chrom@@ ati@@ city data for improved colour allocation for hetero@@ geneous platforms . the disadvantage is that there are relative many administrative information , but not as many as TI@@ FF and has a slow compression . &quot;
TI@@ FF is widely used as image format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with los@@ s@@ less compression algorithm ( Def@@ late ) . it manages images in high quality but requires very large files .
D@@ NG The Digital Neg@@ ative file format is a license @-@ free and open @-@ format image format developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG is developed on the TI@@ FF / EP format and is obliged to use metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers now provide D@@ NG and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon can use it at some point .
&quot; this is possibly one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; image resource block@@ age ; X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata Plat@@ forms quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; which stands for XML / R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording , mostly in the raw format . X@@ MP fits because it stores the metadata separately from the image file . however , it can cause problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file and as mentioned above , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put it all together . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Met@@ adata Initiative is an open organization that supports fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s activities include working on architecture and modeling , discussions and collaborative work in D@@ C@@ MI communities , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a broad acceptance of metadata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the pictures are on the camera edi@@ um , you can use this as a temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them to your raw archive . this feature is not yet implemented .
&quot; for a fine layer editing , you can use external programs . if you edit the pictures again with &amp; digi@@ kam , then you should add the metadata again . these may be trun@@ cated by the other programs . &quot;
&quot; use the edited pictures for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them to web galleries only , code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ kam . in the addition of a photo to an album you will find a description , how you can add photos that you already have on your hard disk . however , the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your Al@@ ben@@ Database . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ cam ; to use , connect the camera to the display mode and turn it on . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when you start the camera interface , it tries to connect to your camera . for some cameras it may take a while . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for file allocation for each file , photos , movies , music etc. are displayed on the camera . &quot;
&quot; before downloading the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the page bars properties and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata . &quot;
this dialog displays file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
&quot; the Met@@ adata dialog shows the internal metadata such as Ex@@ it , manufacturer &apos;s notes , GPS , etc. of the image . this information is the same as the metadata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam ; or image editing . note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button Download and then download the selection of all . this downloads the photos from your camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ kam ; . when downloading , the photos are not deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures were safely downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera . &quot;
&quot; if you do not want to download all photos , just select the desired ones using the standard selection methods of &amp; k@@ de ; once you have selected the photos , use the button Download and then download Sel@@ ected . the button Sel@@ ected is di@@ gest@@ ed as long as you have selected some photos . &quot;
&quot; if your camera supports this , a new option is available for download . in this case , the new pictures have been marked with a star in the preview window . if you select this option , of course only the new pictures will be downloaded . &quot;
&quot; if you are using the All or Sel@@ ected buttons , a dialog with which you can select the target album will appear in which the photos are stored . you can read the list of existing albums , like normal folder , then select the target album from the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after you selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ kam ; download the photos from the camera into the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete them all at once by using the Del@@ ete All Del@@ ete button . if you want to delete only some , you must select them first and then delete them . &quot;
&quot; please note that there is no possibility to recover photos that you have deleted from the camera . you should check carefully if the photos have been successfully downloaded in a digi@@ kam ; album , before you delete them from the camera . if you want to delete the camera screen completely , you should do this via the camera menu , as this is much faster . &quot;
&quot; the fil@@ en@@ ames are usually re@@ used after the photos were deleted from the camera . this can lead to dup@@ licate file names , if you load photos of different recording sets into the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time at which the image was taken into the fil@@ en@@ ames . &quot;
&quot; in the next section , you will find options for turning and mirr@@ oring the image and for data @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder will be created per day . &quot;
&quot; the options Dur@@ ing the transfer will open three additional options that are performed before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two will affect the author in the Standard Aut@@ or@@ denti@@ ty section . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the ex@@ if information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you want a different format than the default format , you can use the Pre@@ fix Photo % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % M : % S , for example . &quot;
&quot; if you use the camera fil@@ en@@ ame option , you have the option to change the file names in lower@@ case . or in upper@@ case if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new fil@@ en@@ ame , which &amp; digi@@ kam ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name the camera provides in the preview . your settings to ren@@ ame are saved and used automatically when you open the camera window the next time . &quot;
&quot; not all cameras provide this information . in the Met@@ adata section , you can read more details about the information that your camera embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; the automatic rotation is normally turned on , and if your camera does not provide this information , it makes &amp; digi@@ kam ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic rotation , use the Advanced Button and select the automatic rotation in the lower part of the window . &quot;
&quot; if your camera provides information about the date the photo has been made available , &amp; digi@@ kam ; this use to automatically create sub@@ albums in the target album . all images with the same date are loaded into the same lower album . not all cameras provide this information . &quot;
&quot; this option is normally off , and in this case it stores &amp; digi@@ kam ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to turn on this option . &quot;
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to their camera is the button download . then select Up@@ load . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files that are to be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the default &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
&quot; after the image selection is done , asks &amp; digi@@ kam ; you where the pictures should be uploaded . a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . select the desired folder and press OK to start the upload . the images are not deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this means a position indicated in length and width and which can be displayed on a map . the determination of the data can be carried out by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to car@@ away an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you later forgot where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser that displays the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ kam ; users who want to locate the location of the photo , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is , how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that exi@@ bility supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , saddle and map references . there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , via re@@ processing the GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical mapping ( manual ) and last through manual entry of known places . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera that integrates a GPS unit . but there are a few that work together with GPS receivers . either as card module or by transmitting the data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
&quot; downloading GPS data from a device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , you must save this data in GP@@ X format as this is the only format supported by the module for geographic mapping . &quot;
there are several programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the long@@ itude and l@@ atitude or other data , you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Harv@@ ey . it uses the template ha@@ iry coordinates created e.g. by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European street maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , showing all the navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can change between these settings , by clicking on the icons on the left . &quot;

&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written to the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields if the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface . &quot;
&quot; author title is a syn@@ onym for the author &apos;s line : this field should contain the professional name of the photographer . this can be desig@@ nations such as a hired photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . as this is a further description of the author &apos;s field , this must also be filled . &quot;
&quot; publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to indicate which the photo offers . this does not have to be the author , if this is the picture to others &amp; quot ; . if the picture is a bearing photo , then the group or agency that provides the image will be listed here . &quot;
IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC ri@@ ms . this ensures that the metadata is permanently present in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ kam ; these metadata also contains other programs and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ kam ; imported without being lost .
&quot; save images as embedded cap@@ tions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG pictures : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the labels embedded in the images . this allows your cap@@ tions to be read by other image viewers . &quot;
&quot; the Settings page contains all the information that appears when the cursor is in the main window above a file . depending on the chosen option , this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; &amp; # 160 ; digi@@ kam ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ kam , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list . each file in a &amp; digi@@ kam ; Night@@ folder that will not have any of these extensions , by &amp; digi@@ kam ; ignored . &quot;
the default settings can be reset by clicking the Update button on the right of each category .
&quot; the settings of the be@@ acon of &amp; digi@@ kam ; can be set on this page to the default values . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . if you have one , you can get better viewing results . &quot;
&quot; by default , the image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can disable the tool bar when you use the image processing in full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with darker or bright color in the image . these colors are specified here . in the image processing , this view mode with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 can be switched on and off . &quot;
Chro@@ ma @-@ Sub@@ sampling means that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance than in color information . please refer to this article in Wikipedia for a closer explanation .
&quot; with the P@@ NG compression setting you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality as P@@ NG requires a los@@ s@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast machine , you can set this value to a high compression . &quot;
&quot; with the option to comp@@ ress TI@@ FF files , you can turn the default compression algorithm for TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF images . it has no influence on image quality as the default algorithm works los@@ s@@ less . &quot;
&quot; if you select the los@@ s@@ less JPEG 2000 files , you can save los@@ s@@ less . even if you select the los@@ s@@ less setting , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , metadata was not yet supported , but was in the planning . &quot;
&quot; in earlier versions of &amp; digi@@ kam , image editing was just an image viewer for photos . currently , it is developing very quickly to a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog you can change the image editing settings . &quot;
&quot; if you use this option , solve this problem with minimal loss of details . if you use this option , solve this problem with minimal loss of details . this option draws the image a little soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 mesh patterns with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used . &quot;
this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . standard is a fixed color balance based on a white card photographed in the sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images get more details in four steps . for other cameras this option is ignored .
&quot; the default is the top lights , so the parts of your pictures that are burned out , due to the inability of your camera to catch the sh@@ utter lights , as a thorou@@ gh@@ going white . finally , use the setting through white in the settings . finally , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the top lights . &quot;
&quot; this is possible because blue pixels are generally not as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ kam ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions from the still uns@@ atur@@ ated blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much color or white you want . &quot;
&quot; if you select the re@@ construct option , you get the option to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each picture . &quot;
&quot; set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably have to set it slightly higher than the standard 1 . however , this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing . to keep the time for the dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively . &quot;
&quot; a dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the partial raw data that many cameras have , and which provides a matrix of color pixels . this algorithm is also known as CF@@ A inter@@ pol@@ ation or color reconstruction . &quot;
&quot; and D@@ cra@@ w provide you three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks like A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ ated Direc@@ ted ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . however , it creates color art@@ ef@@ acts on the edges . &quot;
&quot; if you know the color deviation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a color sof@@ tening correction since it is carried out during raw conversion . &quot;
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to be given again . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information such as the color information from one color space to translate into the other so that the colors are as accurate as possible .
&quot; if a picture is opened in the image processing , the behavior questions will start with raw files . &quot;
&quot; color Profile Fol@@ der Loc@@ ate the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you can store all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will examine these folders during startup . &quot;
&quot; settings of ICC profiles You have here the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to be deposited , everything can be changed when opening the raw file . &quot;
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your pictures color @-@ managed not the entire screen .
&quot; the input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturer and model you use . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which do not include color mapping or g@@ amma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w g@@ amma does not correct for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you must perform the color mapping itself . &quot;
&quot; there are other options such as the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile that you can em@@ ulate on how to restore your image from one device . this is very useful before you can print image , since your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated . this could be manually correct instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras it is quite obvious which color profile is provided for for what is provided . unfortunately , not with the models of Canon . therefore , here follows a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is , of course , in@@ official : &quot;
&quot; the Canon profile extension makes the style for the target : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for standard style . &quot;
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . it is an interface supported by a series of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewers and image editing . by providing this interface it can &amp; digi@@ kam ; many modules that were written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
&quot; if your distribution has the K@@ IP@@ I modules installed , you will see a list of the available modules . select the modules you want to use and they will then be loaded by &amp; digi@@ kam ; these modules will appear as new entries in the main window menu and you will also find some in the context menu of the preview . &quot;
&quot; short commands for tasks performed by modules , can be set in the menu under Settings short commands . &quot;
more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plu@@ g@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
&quot; the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper knob adju@@ sts the time between the image transitions , normally 4 @-@ 5 seconds are good . &quot;
&quot; the camera features show a list of all supported cameras on the left . on the right side there is a button automatic detection , trying to identify a camera that is connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure that the camera is properly connected , switched on and in the screen mode . currently , serial , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage are supported . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom end , you can set the path for USB and Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you have selected a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list . you must specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / Rem@@ ov@@ able , on which you attach your camera . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ cam ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring them to the display mode and turn on . &quot;
&quot; if not , you can manually set camera models and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu . &quot;
&quot; you can select any name for your camera , which is displayed in the main window of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can insert all of them here . &quot;
&quot; with the option confirmation dialog for moving &gt; Images in the tr@@ ash Perm , you can set the conversation &amp; digi@@ kam ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album , you will find further details when del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting an album . &quot;
&quot; the editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly processed by &amp; digi@@ kam ; apply if you use the option to apply changes in the right side@@ bar without any queries . otherwise , you need to apply changes to the button changes . &quot;
&quot; you can also display &amp; digi@@ kam type of welcome screen ; when starting , this speeds up &amp; digi@@ kam , under certain circumstances . &quot;
&quot; setting Bei@@ m Start to search for new photos forces &amp; digi@@ kam ; to search the base folder after new or deleted albums / photos . this leng@@ th@@ ens the starting time &amp; digi@@ kam ; . if something has been deleted from the base folder , asks &amp; digi@@ kam ; you know if it is to delete it from the database . &quot;
different color schemes can be used in &amp; digi@@ kam ; used to customize the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected from the toolbar in settings Design . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
&quot; these designs are defined in plain text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam , please find more information about this in this tutorial . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ kam ; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos and to correct and improve . image processing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the contex@@ tual menu of the preview and selecting the entry View / Edit menu .
&quot; image editing includes a series of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ kam , so you may not be part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules , see the Image Processing section . &quot;
&quot; a status line at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current file number , magni@@ fication factor , and the current image size . &quot;
a menu bar on the upper edge and below the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently needed functions .
editing functions of image editing change your photos . none of the functions will change the original photo before using File Save or Save button Save from the toolbar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo as soon as you have saved the image .
you should also make a copy of your image before you change it . this can be done using File Save as exec@@ uting it .
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by re@@ covering from the File menu or using the button &quot; &quot; Rest@@ ore the Image processing &quot; &quot; button in the toolbar . &quot;
almost any action of image editing can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action can be revers@@ ed by selecting Edit undo or restoring by selecting Edit Rest@@ ore from the menu .
&quot; if you use this frequently , you should make the short@@ cuts , C@@ trl ; -@@ Z to undo and remember C@@ trl ; switch @-@ Z to restore . &quot;
&quot; if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; press the undo or restore button in the toolbar for a moment longer , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will also be revers@@ ed or restored . &quot;
&quot; once you have started editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar , image high , image , or the entries in the File menu . if you have made any changes in the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save them . &quot;
you can enter in the photo and zoom out in which you use C@@ trl ; mou@@ se@@ wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu .
&quot; to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the toolbar : choose magni@@ fication factor automatically &quot;
&quot; full@@ screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . you enter the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c button . if you do not want this , you can change this in the Setup dialog by &amp; digi@@ kam . you can view it from the &amp; digi@@ kam window . see the section for setting up the image processing . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current image , you can print image printing in the File menu and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; Print dialog . you can customize the settings here before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu you can print single images or whole sets . all picture templates can be printed from your selection . you just have to select the images using the standard methods and select from the menu album Export Pres@@ sure Assistant . if you follow the wizard , you only need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ kam ; main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side bar is available , without the navigation file , even in image editing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked : &quot;
multiple clicking on the same tab lets the side@@ bar appear or disappear again in the margin .
the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the labels are copied to the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs .
&quot; the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are trun@@ cated after 2000 characters and special characters are changed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC label array in other applications , you should observe these restrictions . &quot;
&quot; once you have commented on it , use either the user button or simply switch to the next image , the labels will then be saved . &quot;
&quot; next to the App@@ ly button , there is a button more . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write the metadata in the files . however , this is always done when you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the pictures . &quot;
&quot; the review rating shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars to the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ trl + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select it and use the context menu . &quot;
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field ur@@ gency . the code is followed by the schema in the following table :
&quot; the keyword list shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keyword tree and a selection box with the keywords used previously in this &amp; digi@@ kam ; session . &quot;
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the given keyword . you can restrict the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword . this ability is especially useful if you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom is another relief when entering keywords for a series of images . if you have entered different keywords , they will be saved for quick access . &quot;
keywords can also be set by selecting the appropriate check boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored in the keyword ( IP@@ TC ) .
&quot; if you select multiple images in the main screen and select a keyword in the keyword tree , this is applied only to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection , if you want to add a selection with a keyword , please read the keyword filter section . &quot;
&quot; the Key@@ word filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side@@ bar is used with their album , - date , keyword and search views . if one or more keywords are used from the right @-@ hand side , only the intersection of these two is displayed . all compiled keywords are available . &quot;
&quot; you can also drag and drop keywords . assuming you have selected several images in the main view , you can simply pull it out of the right side@@ bar and put it on the selection . then a dialog appears asking you if you want to set the keyword . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example , the main window displays the images on a calendar day . the keyword filter is on no keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . you have been selected using C@@ trl + a , and then a keyword from the right keyword tree is drawn to the selection and stored there . a dialog asks if this keyword is to be set . &quot;
this search for changes takes place at any start of the program . it can also be switched on settings Mis@@ cellaneous .
&quot; if you have a rule with and created and state that it should be one or more , you can easily change this with a double click on the text and in the control area . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the entry after which is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc . &quot;
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
&quot; for example , you can choose an Advanced search over all elements of the database with the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the button group@@ ing . the options then look like this : &quot;

this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this job . I have mainly adapted it to &amp; digi@@ kam ; s concrete implementation .
&quot; the reason why one utili@@ zes a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner will have a predictable deviation from the actually photographed or scann@@ ed colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor match those of your camera or scanner and that the colors that you print or publish on the Web to those from your digital dark@@ room . &quot;
&quot; the purpose of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about color management . in addition , the purpose of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about color management . in addition , links with deeper information allow you to make your own informed decisions to make you obtain the desired result . &quot;
&quot; if your picture workflow meets all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management . &quot;
you work on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below for more information )
&quot; your only other image editions are by email or web , where s@@ RGB is de facto standard . &quot;
&quot; so if s@@ RGB works so well , and life is so easy for everyone , why should one use another color space and have to think about color management ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB compared to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all the colors we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in the s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some bigger colour spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
do I have to c@@ alli@@ ate my monitor if I decided to work only in the s@@ RGB colour space ?
&quot; yes ! whether you &apos;re working in the s@@ RGB colour space or not , you will need to c@@ alli@@ ate your monitor , since s@@ RGB is assuming that your ; on@@ itor works on s@@ RGB , then you need to c@@ alli@@ ate your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard , use a suitable monitor profile or both . &quot;

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore use it before attempting any further manual editing .
&quot; the functions norm@@ alize , matching , automatic matching and contrast extend from the Cor@@ rigi@@ ble Automatic correction menu try to automatically make the most of your colors . you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo . &quot;
norm@@ alize : this method scales the lumin@@ aire values over the entire image so that the dark@@ est point is black and the brigh@@ test point is as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or full @-@ washed .
&quot; similar : this method adju@@ sts the brightness of the color of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible . sometimes the result achieves very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it also produces tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation which either causes miracles in an image or it destro@@ ys it . &quot;
&quot; automatic adjustment : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . it detects the dark and light boundary tones and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram range . &quot;
contrast : this method enhances the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the wid@@ est possible range and a new ji@@ b of all values in between . this is only visible in full @-@ washed pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo .
&quot; the white balance correction is slightly limited because a color space with 8 bits per color is worked . if you are able to run too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure may occur . if you can do the white balance in raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction will be better . &quot;
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is copy@@ righ@@ ted by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you start it via the menu entry color white balance of image processing .
&quot; the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left side , both the original image and the preview of the target image can be seen . the preview is dynamically adapted to the settings of the tool . &quot;
the preview of the target photos has a red marker . the pixel of the pixel under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
&quot; at the top right , a hist@@ ogram shows that dynamically changed once you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit images , most pixels very small lumin@@ ance values . with one button , you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum will be displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow adjustment lets you improve or di@@ mming the shadow details of your photos . &quot;
&quot; to play an@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . in this way , the temperature and green values are set automatically . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of default settings . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pix@@ els is over@@ exposed .. You will get the combined result displayed in the white balance . this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons do exactly this . each setting of the white balance you have set can save you to a text file and rel@@ o@@ ad later .
the pres@@ et button sets all the filter values back to their default values and the associated neutral white balance . note that even neutral settings will result in another photograph as your original . if you save it your original image will be changed .
&quot; you can set the encoding depth per color channel of the processed image here . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better for high quality images . however , this coding needs more disk space , computing time and is only available for P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and D@@ NG formats . &quot;
this tool opens the same dialog as used for the processing of color profiles . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color mapping can be done through the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed guide for using color profiles allows you to consult the chapter Color management .
&quot; this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously , allowing you to use them for multiple photos . this is helpful if your camera or scanner always make the same mistake and you will always need the same correction . &quot;
a very powerful possibility to correct exposure issues is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find in colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool color effects provide you with four color effects , a solar installation effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect of the phot@@ op@@ aper from the additional light . this had the effect that the lighter areas darker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second illumination . the result was a partial neg@@ ativity of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine . &quot;
&quot; the intensity controls the solar pol@@ arization . at approx . 50 % intensity , the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . a further increase ultimately creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photographic paper . &quot;
this is an example of the solar installation effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the applied intensity is 30 % .
the vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation by making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it simply to embell@@ ish many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an in@@ verse color film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth texture . Vel@@ via offers highly saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts .
&quot; the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on light . for large images , the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment . &quot;
digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not un@@ common to correct the color contrast and lumin@@ osity of the photos . you can experiment with the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors .
&quot; also in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation rather than increase it . all changes you can perform can be viewed in the preview . if you like the result , you can confirm the changes with O@@ k . &quot;
&quot; between the complex tool Gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous / contrast / g@@ amma the tool is set to improve the exposure . even if the dialog with this tool works very complicated , you only need the area of the sli@@ ders for the purpose intended here . concrete the three sli@@ ders below the hist@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . below the graph three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked in and that can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas . &quot;
the easiest way to learn how to use it is to move the controls and take care of how the image changes .
&quot; on the right side , the original and the preview of the image can be viewed . the preview is updated dynamically , based on the settings of the image . on the left side , the following options are available . &quot;
&quot; sc@@ aling : with this selection box , it is possible to set the hist@@ ogram with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera , linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single column . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic division is useful . &quot;
&quot; three controllers : the upper@@ most one for the dark tones , the middle for the light tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often called g@@ amma values . &quot;
&quot; the three shades of color can be used in the preview of the original image to adjust the input values of shadows , middle and light tones automatically . in addition , there is a button for a fully automatic alignment . &quot;
&quot; output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values inter@@ actively as in the input values . for example , the compression of the output values can be used to create a hidden image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground . &quot;
&quot; automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image . &quot;
&quot; save as and load : with these buttons , the set values can be saved in the file system and loaded later . for this purpose , the Gim@@ p level format is used . &quot;
&quot; if you use this mode and the three colour pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input values are automatically adjusted for all shadows , remedies and sun shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels . &quot;
&quot; the option over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels in order to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result . &quot;
&quot; below is an example of adjusting the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left hand side , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings . on the right @-@ hand side , the following options are available : &quot;
&quot; modi@@ fier Channel : this selection box allows you to specify the channel , which is modified by the module : &quot;
&quot; in addition to this box , there are two icons to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for images that have been recorded with a digital camera , linear mode creates a wide beam . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode helps . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you move a curve part to the right , e.g. the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones correspond to darker output tones and that the associated image pixels become darker . &quot;
&quot; on the preview of the original photos is a red marker to be seen . if you want to move this marker to the area you want to change , a suitable line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste . &quot;
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . each curve that you created can be saved in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
&quot; if you use this method and the three pi@@ pet@@ tes buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadows , medium and sun shades . activate the colour pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve . &quot;
&quot; the option over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun shades were set with the colour pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photo .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer for image processing .
with the channel selection box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first hint of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precip@@ itation . the left pane of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed by comparison to your own rider .
&quot; the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the image , a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to show you the corresponding color value . &quot;
&quot; controls for the module are right down : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you want to preserve L@@ umin@@ anz , the image will also retain the general brightness , as the channel mixer is then the tool to generate great black @-@ and @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ och@@ rome , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the color channel . colour space consists of small noise art@@ ef@@ acts that do not appear at the same place in the color channel and their noise patterns in each channel looks different . if that is the case , you can improve your mon@@ och@@ rome conversion by first reducing the color space . &quot;
the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons are used exactly for this purpose . you can save any bl@@ ender setting to store them later and then load them . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
&quot; the option over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels in order to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been read@@ ju@@ sted . the L@@ umin@@ ance option is enabled . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . black / white is a work step with the development of digital photography as color images can be easily converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles .
&quot; Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3@@ 200 , Il@@ ford FP@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P2 Super &quot;
&quot; green Fil@@ ters : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scene pictures and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky . so similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter . &quot;
&quot; orange filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves scen@@ eries , maritime scene and air photos . &quot;
red Fil@@ ters : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simulate mo@@ on@@ light scenes at the time of the day . similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) rotation filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ aton : produces warm light and medium sounds while adding a little cold in the sh@@ ading tones . this is very similar to the process of stopping a pressure and re@@ development in a s@@ epi@@ ph@@ onic . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) s@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
&quot; with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; apply tool texture , you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture . &quot;
&quot; by adding a texture to your image , whether it is a color image or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall . &quot;
relief : move this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the image .
a paper tex@@ tual defect has been applied to the picture below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) . the relief parameter has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool frames can be added a decorative frame to add a picture .
keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . a possibility to keep your attention is a psychological barrier to the stra@@ y eye . this is a psychological barrier to the stra@@ y eye .
&quot; type : with this parameter , set the desired type of frame for your image . passing through the picture with a colored line , rounded it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white pictures ) , it finishes with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame which is ideal for a kno@@ ck@@ out effect and decorative adds a decorative frame with patterns . &quot;
width : specifies the width of the frame in percent . the width of the frame is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; the target image decorated with the frame will be larger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool Accor@@ ding to aspect ratio earlier . &quot;
&quot; with this handy tool , you can easily insert a format@@ ted text into an image at any position . this also works in multiple places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text direction , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its characteristics as you need it . you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background . &quot;
&quot; any setting you chose for your text can be changed until you press the &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; button . once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed . &quot;
with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; apply mold template you can place a template on a picture .
the Image templates Edit template can be used in image editing can be used to stack templates over a picture .
&quot; for the template there are no restrictions regarding size and orientation . however , you must take the P@@ NG file format and should work with maximum comp@@ ressing ( 9 ) for decreasing the file size of the templates . if you want to add your template of the templates , just send an e @-@ mail in English to the &amp; digi@@ kam ; mailing list digi@@ kam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .. &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your sten@@ cil folder with the button base folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you copied the template files . these settings will be marked for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after the root folder has been set for the templates , a tree view appears to reflect the folder structure of the template folder . the selection of a folder automatically updates the thumb@@ nail of the templates . &quot;
&quot; under the preview , there are three buttons that you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image . &quot;
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the underlying image . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; shrink : this button res@@ izes the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the full picture , you must make the image smaller . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move : use this button to move the image lying under the template . take the picture and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your picture . the image will then be adapted automatically to the thumb@@ nail size .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
&quot; sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but creates , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images . &quot;
&quot; the sharp@@ ness mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture shar@@ per . in fact , it does not shar@@ pen a bit , it works rather psych@@ oso@@ cial . you can use it to remove atmospheric vap@@ or and it makes a really good job . the algorithm has been taken from Gim@@ p and it is copy@@ righ@@ ted by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang . &quot;
re@@ focusing is possibly the best of the three since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment .
&quot; images without focus as well as most digi@@ ti@@ sed images need a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this is because the digi@@ tization process must be summ@@ arized with only minimal differences to a colour point . therefore , the same phenomenon can be observed when colour points are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras normally require more retro@@ sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users . &quot;
&quot; in JPEG pictures , a camera is often applied to internal sharp@@ ness . images in the raw format , on the other hand , must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing . &quot;
&quot; some scann@@ ers turn a field filter while reading the image . if you disable it , you will get control of your image . &quot;
&quot; in some situations , you can get useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the sharp@@ ness of the sharp@@ ness . you can use the menu entry to apply correc@@ ting the sharp@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; you should deal with caution because the results do not work very naturally : the sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also ampli@@ fies noise . generally , the most suitable technique is to re@@ focus the sharp@@ ness of an image . you can re@@ focus further information and a comparison of all techniques to focus . &quot;
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution to draw the image a little soft is much easier than to shar@@ pen . use the tool for soft sign with the menu entry of correc@@ ting sof@@ ten@@ ers and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ sharp mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove sli@@ me from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and the preview help to edit the image . the preview window shows the filter output with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the standard values often generate good results and should be tried first . if you make the sharp@@ ness mask too strong , noise and the impression of gr@@ ates will produce close to sharp edges . &quot;
the radius represents how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i .
&quot; the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blur@@ red image , which is added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set . &quot;
&quot; the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applying difference amount . thus , you can define a minimal difference with that for an edge of the filter . thus , areas with a soft change between the sounds are exemp@@ t from shar@@ per and hence , beauty errors in faces , skies and water surfaces are avoided . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the un@@ sharp mas@@ king filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image is applied ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp mas@@ king was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool re@@ focused re@@ focuses a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copyright @-@ protected escap@@ ing filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is a better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tering . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is the use of a blur@@ ry mask . re@@ focus mostly results better results as vag@@ ue mas@@ king . you can start it from the menu by re@@ focusing on colors in image editing .
&quot; in practice the circular folding works much better than the G@@ auss &apos;s folding . the G@@ auss &apos;s folding has a very long tail , which results in the mathematical result also from the source pix@@ ies that are far from the original source pixel . &quot;
&quot; this is the most important parameter for using this module . for most images , the default value should result 1 good results . &quot;
correlation : an increase in correlation can help to reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and values close to 1 ; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for correlation reduces the sharp@@ ness effect of the module .
&quot; filter can take values of 0 @-@ 1 . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , the image quality is very bad . a usable value is 0,@@ 03 . a high value will continue to s@@ me@@ ar the image even further . &quot;
&quot; G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the palate &apos; sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your sharp@@ ness is Gau@@ ß &apos; sch . in most cases , you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . if you use a value non @-@ zero , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter . &quot;
&quot; this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the size of the die can produce good results , especially if you select large values for this parameter . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameter you have set will be stored for later and can then be loaded .
&quot; try to perform all tri@@ mming , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the picture before using the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise you should use the module before changing the image otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations that are not visible immediately , but later leave unpleasant art@@ ef@@ acts . &quot;
&quot; when you read and comp@@ ress images , eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image . &quot;
&quot; in general , im@@ sharp masks produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by the blur@@ ry mas@@ king a larger neighborhood than sharpen@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; theoretically , im@@ sharp masks must always create art@@ ef@@ acts . even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of blur@@ red . for the Viennese filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal Lin@@ e@@ are filter . practically , the result of the FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ ters is always as good as the sharp@@ ness mask . the FI@@ R Wiener Filter is often better in processing small details . &quot;
&quot; below you can see a comparison between the different filters , applied on a small un@@ focused image : &quot;
this image has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focuss@@ ed result is due to in@@ sufficiently light for the car focus lens .
for more information on the sharp@@ ness correction methods in digital pictures you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
the regul@@ ators smooth@@ en the sharp@@ ness of the area that has been dark@@ ened to create a more natural pup@@ il .
&quot; the ink ink enables a customized colour for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , you can adjust it here . &quot;
the tool image error correction is one of the most developed tools to remove unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various default settings as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available default settings are listed below :
&quot; if you want to adjust the filter settings fine , you can use the tab smooth@@ ing and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; detail conservation p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to a uniform smooth@@ ing over the image . a value of 0.@@ 9 should be maintained in such a way that no sharpen@@ ing is necessary afterwards . note that the detail @-@ keeping should always be subordin@@ ated to the direction of direction . &quot;
&quot; alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es evenly in all directions while a value close to 1 is only smooth@@ ed in one direction . if you have a film gra@@ ining or CCD noise will produce a high value wave @-@ like pattern . JPEG arti@@ facts are best removed with a value near 1 . &quot;
&quot; smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smooth@@ ing factor above all@@ it@@ . p then defines the relative smooth@@ ing . therefore set this value to the degree of noise in your image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if a lot of noise is present , since it is difficult to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 . &quot;
repeat : specifies how often the algorithm is going through . normally 1 or 2 is sufficient .
&quot; angle incre@@ ments da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is selected small , it should also be small . make sure that small angles have a long run time . therefore , you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs . &quot;
&quot; integrated stri@@ de length &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step width in pixels . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smooth@@ ing and never larger than 2 . &quot;
&quot; use linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more quality you receive by selecting this option is only slight , but it doubles the run@@ time . we recommend it to let it out . &quot;
the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons make this happen . any adjustment of image errors can be saved to a text file and loaded later .
&quot; correc@@ ting image errors is relatively quick at work . however , it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the Canc@@ el button . &quot;
below you can see how image errors can be corrected with small arti@@ facts . the module is applied in a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see there is a peculiar black art@@ ef@@ act in the foreground that caused by a bad film storage during the journey . the original image is under ( 1 ) to see and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool for reducing noise . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove stain@@ s and other art@@ ef@@ acts that come from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of scann@@ ed images from books or magazines .
&quot; if you need more information about the sensor noise of digital cameras , you can read them in this tutorial . &quot;
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene that was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ ined noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
&quot; in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window Advanced Settings can remain with the default settings . &quot;
radius controls the window size from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) used for the filter . large values increase the time the filters are used per pixel and can blur@@ b the image . the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smooth@@ ed and thus minor errors are cleaned .
&quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel pitch when the filter looks forward to determine lumin@@ ance changes . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or s@@ me@@ aring occurs again . &quot;
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong it can not be removed the entire noise or noise peaks can occur . set it to a value near the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG arti@@ facts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend changing either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend changing either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process controlled by the details settings .
&quot; g@@ amma : controls the tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas , which are typically more rau@@ cous , but also lubric@@ ates the shadow areas . &quot;
&quot; atten@@ u@@ ation : controls adjustment of phase noise atten@@ u@@ ation . this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius re@@ acts to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , the edges appear smo@@ other when it is too high . &quot;
save under and load : these buttons are used exactly for this purpose . all parameters to reduce the noise you have set can be saved to the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . noise reduction was applied with the default settings .
&quot; the solution to draw the image a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use the tool for soft sign with the menu entry of correc@@ ting sof@@ ten@@ ers , and experiment with the smooth@@ ing . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
&quot; this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts from your images . it is very well adapted to remove G@@ auss &apos;s noise , film gra@@ dation , scrat@@ ches , compression art@@ ef@@ acts and local errors that occur in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ alized images . &quot;
&quot; the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich , and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project . &quot;
&quot; reduce JPEG arti@@ facts : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm , it creates a few compression &amp; quot ; Artef@@ acts quot ; - small standards that are seen in the un@@ compressed image . this setting is intended to correct these problems . &quot;
the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons do exactly this . each setting of photo restore can be saved into a text file and loaded later .
&quot; photo restoration is relatively quick at work . however , it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Stop . &quot;
below you can see how a photo with uni@@ form@@ istic noise is restored .. The module is applied to a black and white photo that has been taken with a min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film gra@@ ining on the faces . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected unter ( 2 ) .
&quot; below you can see another example of photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures have been reduced to an old colour photo created using a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts caused by scanner illumination and the photo paper . the original image is below ( 1 ) to see and the corrected image below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows Hot@@ pixel of photos with a CCD camera , eight were removed . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project , which are copy@@ righ@@ ted by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p . &quot;
&quot; bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high @-@ quality rough mode photos since many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels . &quot;
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &apos; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; in a photo with a dark image sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
load this file into the wizard with the button dark@@ picture . the tool will automatically recognize the hot and light pixels . these will be highlighted in the image preview .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important to record the dark image directly in order to detect new hot or light pixels by CCD defects . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should download the appropriate dark image to the corrected image . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . note that the assistant notices the last dark image and re@@ charges it automatically in the next session . &quot;
the image area and the preview help to correct the result within the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are raised in all preview areas .
select an area to view the defective pixel on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the available filters :
Dur@@ ing : an average of the neighbour pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a spac@@ ing of 1 from pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixel in the block .
&quot; square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a spac@@ ing of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn up to compu@@ te a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square corners ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block . &quot;
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn up to compu@@ te a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixel in the block .
&quot; below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is shown below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ kam ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image . &quot;
&quot; wide @-@ angle lenses , especially those in medium and large photo format , can often not evenly illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area . instead , &amp; quot ; vi@@ gn@@ et@@ ectable &quot; ; ( sh@@ aded ) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light to the sensor there . tel@@ eph@@ oto lenses may also show this behavior . &quot;
&quot; many center filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 of the aperture filter , which increases the necessary sh@@ utter time under certain circumstances so that it is impossible to use the camera with the hand . wide @-@ angle lenses should , even with center filter , have an aperture of f / 16 or smaller , otherwise there will be no blur@@ red effects caused by movement . &quot;
&quot; with the large exposure of today &apos;s film and colour or gra@@ y@@ scale depth of digital cameras and film scann@@ ers , it is possible to simulate the effect of a center filter by applying an equivalent transformation on a blank image that was made without this filter . the algorithm is protected by John Walker &apos;s copyright . &quot;
with three regul@@ ators you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and with three further the exposure of the target image .
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of the largest density filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which corresponds to an optical filter with an aperture of 1 , or by chance of a lumin@@ ous intensity of 2 , reduce the density to compensate for a greater degree of vi@@ gn@@ etting . &quot;
&quot; brightness , contrast and g@@ amma setting : editing an image with the vi@@ gn@@ ette correction reduces the brightness of pixels . you have to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controllers only provide you with positive values , since you only need to increase the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want a fine adjustment of the exposure of the target image , leave the values for brightness / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing from the Color Gra@@ dation menu . &quot;
this is an example of the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction applied to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gn@@ etting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a lumin@@ ous and contrast correction was also performed in the image with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . colour distor@@ tions cannot be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second gra@@ der treats the general geomet@@ rical distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
&quot; the coefficient of the third gra@@ der has a similar round effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s on the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot;
&quot; the coefficient of the fourth gra@@ der correc@@ ts the distant corners towards that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geomet@@ rical distortion can be almost eliminated . &quot;
&quot; general : this value controls the strength of distortion second degree . with negative values , tension @-@ shaped distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion . &quot;
&quot; corner : this value controls the thickness of the distortion fourth count . this value acts more strongly to the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; corners &apos; has the in@@ verse in@@ signia of the parameter General . &quot;
zoom : this value sc@@ aled the image size and thus results in a correction of the first degree . negative values enlarge while positive image decreases .
&quot; brigh@@ ten : this value adju@@ sts the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase them . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , the dialogue with a preview illustrates the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start . &quot;
&quot; the ton@@ e- or cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed prior to all cutting or size changes . best perform this correction as the first one . if you re @-@ cut an image and then perform a sound correction , the effect would obviously be the wrong one . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal help line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to view the dotted lines . move it to an important place , such as the sea edge or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . &quot;
&quot; if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove them with the C@@ utter tool in the Trans@@ forming C@@ utting out of the image processing or via the Zoom regulator of this dialog . &quot;
&quot; the next logical step for some motives , such as shots from front , frame and paintings , is to correct the perspective in such a way that all angles in the image have 90 degrees . note that when you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the sound @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the algorithm is based on a method to simulate infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ anz@@ u.@@ org website that is accessible under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ IR film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
in the left side of the window you can select the area for the preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview you can set two parameters set for film gra@@ ining and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . add the Add Film Con@@ gr@@ ation option if you want to simulate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO controller changes the amount of film grains and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white as snow !
&quot; as the filter mixes color channels for producing infrared films , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos , as the color information is missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infr@@ a @-@ red filter applied to a landscape photograph from New Zealand . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the top lights .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter film gra@@ ding is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film gra@@ ding on your pictures . this is known from classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , the makers mix large silver grains of photographic emul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; the film gra@@ ding effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past . the treated image gets a timeless atmosphere loos@@ ened from everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gra@@ iny sight especially in your mon@@ och@@ rome photos , you must use this filter . &quot;
&quot; the controller can calibr@@ ate the ISO sensitivity to check the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are needed , on ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need even more grains , you can apply the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the film encoding effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the used film sensitivity is ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . nature pictures and still life are good for this effect .
&quot; the upper sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thicker brushes are better suited for large images . fl@@ atten controls the smooth@@ ness or , from the other side , the hing@@ ness . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the processor is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel large picture is 1 and smooth@@ ed 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter char@@ coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a coal gau@@ ze . the lines whose gra@@ dients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you chose to sket@@ ch around you . these would be good pictures to start .
there are two controllers with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the top knob adju@@ sts the pin size and the lower adju@@ sts the contrast ( smooth@@ ed ) .
this is an example of the carbon drawing filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter en@@ grav@@ ure im@@ prints your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter engraving is a fast tool to give your pictures back with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure , in which color is not the most important thing in the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey , mon@@ strous landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows to set the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave Blocks 1 : spl@@ its the image into cells and lets it look as if it is seen through glass blocks .
wave Blocks 2 : analog@@ ous to the wavel@@ ength 1 the image is distorted with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the button Stop .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of blur@@ ring effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom sharp@@ ness : blur@@ red the image alongside star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a center . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring a zo@@ oming camera and thereby creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image by rotating the pixels by one focal point . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
distance blur@@ b : blur@@ red the image to produce the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to res@@ ign in the background .
&quot; motion blur@@ b : blur@@ red the image by horizontal movements of pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train , camera . &quot;
sof@@ tening blur@@ b : blur@@ red the image sof@@ tly into the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits or glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow .
sha@@ m sharp@@ ness : blur@@ red the image by random shifting of pixels and thus simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of an arbitr@@ arily moving camera .
intelligent blur@@ ring : find the color bas@@ ins in the picture and blur@@ red them without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : shares the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it by filling with an average pixel value .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time using the button Stop .
the ra@@ ind@@ rops are a nice little tool to make ra@@ ind@@ rops on your picture . this makes it natural your images a wet look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n proprietary algorithm .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of the drops . since the drop@@ let size doesn &apos;t automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops .
&quot; you can hold with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing an area free of ra@@ ind@@ rops . use the selection tool to choose the area , e.g. a face that should stay free . if you then start the filter ra@@ ind@@ rops , the area will remain free of ra@@ ind@@ rops . &quot;
this is an example of the Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ fen Fil@@ ters . the original image ( 1 ) shows a calm sunset and the processed image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can get it through mirrors or turning into the correct orientation . &quot;
photo blowing is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with minimal loss of picture quality .
&quot; the big question is , how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom in a picture when the limits of the resolution are reached ? how can you inv@@ ent or guess the missing information ? the C@@ im@@ g algorithm that is used here makes a good job . try it and you will see it yourself . &quot;
&quot; if a picture has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the size of the tool size . select the size change in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is to be seen below . &quot;
&quot; change the tool to size using a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approach the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool for infl@@ ating . &quot;
many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation e.g. sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm Photo infl@@ ated was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
you must tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the New Size tab and are listed below :
&quot; preserve aspect ratio : when this setting is enabled , when entering the new size the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if a lot of noise is present , since it is difficult to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; bul@@ bar effect , it must be set higher than 3 . &quot;
the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons are used in exactly the same way as each st@@ utter for photo magni@@ fication can be saved as text file and rel@@ o@@ aded later .
&quot; infl@@ ating photo is very fast with what it does , but it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Stop . &quot;
you can see below an example of photo infl@@ ating by enlar@@ ging a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear expansion .
&quot; editing a photo is not only a frequently performed operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to make a picture together . to crop a photo , simply use the mouse to create a rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and dra@@ gging the rect@@ angle . you will then see this rect@@ angle while you move the mouse . &quot;
you can change the size of the area to be cut by dra@@ gging at the corners of the rect@@ angle . you can create a new rect@@ angle by simply using the left mouse button .
&quot; once you are satisfied with the cut , use the button The C@@ trl @-@ button of the image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut ( C@@ trl + + X ) . &quot;
&quot; in the preview area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog will be preserved . &quot;
&quot; in the tool After aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as portrait or landscape format . in portrait format , the greater value of height and in the trans@@ verse size of the width is assigned . &quot;
&quot; the tool Accor@@ ding to the aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimet@@ res , inches or any other physical size . you can see for example below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; at the right end of the dialog , there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizont@@ ally or vertically . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the dialog , you can use the Max . ratio button to set the area for cutting to the greatest possible , depending on the selected relationship and orientation . &quot;
&quot; the tool Accor@@ ding to the aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the orientation orientation ( Horiz@@ ont@@ al or Ver@@ tical ) . if you use the tri@@ mming tool next time , these settings are stored as default values depending on orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables so that the EX@@ IF data will reflect the cut image and not the original image . &quot;
&quot; the setup help settings allow you to hide Help , so that you can put your pictures together better . these aids are : &quot;
&quot; harmonic triangle : harmonious divisions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third rule , harmonious tri@@ angles are a possibility to share a rect@@ angle in a similarly harmonious tri@@ angles on the diag@@ on@@ als . &quot;
&quot; golden center : the golden middle is a division of different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us m@@ uss@@ el or the leaves of a sun@@ flower . &quot;
&quot; the golden division is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks to build your temples and pyr@@ ami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden division at all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number deri@@ ves from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden center . a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious . &quot;
the golden center provides smo@@ other guides when you put together a picture . these aids are listed below :
&quot; in comparison with the third rule , the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the gaze of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual flow in this way . &quot;
&quot; a further rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . these rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to create the golden spiral . there should be something that direc@@ ts the eye to the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects . &quot;
&quot; the golden tri@@ angles are also derived from the golden spiral above . your verti@@ ces are the center points of the sides of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are no equal tri@@ angles . diag@@ onal to place these lines can cause a static object to appear more dynamic . &quot;
&quot; if you use golden tri@@ angles to break up your frame , you create an effect of dynamic symmet@@ ry called by professional photographers . try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . &quot;
the Horiz@@ ont@@ al options are mirr@@ ored and vertical mirrors can be used to mirror the harmonious divisions .
&quot; with the color button , you can set the color of the guides . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the guides can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image . &quot;
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
&quot; when you make a photo , it &apos;s easy to keep the camera vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates an image in which things are rot@@ ated by an angle . you can fix this with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing and the tool free rotation . select &quot; &quot; Transform@@ ers Free Rotation &quot; &quot; and adjust the target angle . &quot;
turn your picture with the slider angle . the values on this slide are specified in degrees . with the pres@@ et button you can set the slider to 0 degree . a preview of the rotation is displayed on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are displayed on the right .
&quot; for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to position the two lines . after you have moved it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section . &quot;
&quot; after you have turned a picture , you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to repair it is to use the function Transformation tri@@ mming from image processing . &quot;
an elegant way to trim the image is automatic cutting function . choose one of the following options :
&quot; the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the image a little bit after rotation , but be aware of the above warning . &quot;
all per@@ spec@@ tival transform@@ ations are carried out around a point of reference to the reference point mentioned above . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then be automatically comp@@ uted . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you to change the perspective :
&quot; new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty spaces created by the transformation in pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty spaces created by the transformation in pixels . &quot;
angle to the left : shows the current angle in degrees on the upper left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees on the upper right corner of the transformed area .
angle left bottom : shows the current angle in degree at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degree at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; after adjusting the perspective , the image is slightly s@@ me@@ ared . for a single adjustment , this effect is small but two adjustments create a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; once you have adjusted the perspective , you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean this is to cut the picture with transform@@ ers from the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the placement tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part in the opposite direction . this is not a rotation , the image is distorted . in other words , a rect@@ angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; create your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . if you press pres@@ ets , the angles are reset to zero . preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be shown to the right of the preview pane . &quot;
&quot; your help will fade out a vertical and horizontal line . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the locking tool to adjust your image . &quot;
&quot; after you have done the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the picture gets a bit blur@@ red . for a single sh@@ ear@@ ing this effect is mostly neg@@ li@@ gible , but two ch@@ aps produce twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the picture has tri@@ angular tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to remove them is to cut the picture with transform@@ ers from the image processing . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ kam ; needs a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . therefore , the available formats depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries have been compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; due to this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system , but you will always find JPEG and TI@@ FF . &quot;
&quot; if the extension listed in the list is listed , &amp; digi@@ kam ; you can change this list of file extensions &amp; digi@@ kam ; you can change this list of file extensions . see the configuration section for more information . &quot;
almost all digital cameras save photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras even allow you to select the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression techniques to digital images . redundant information is reduced in order to store image data in a more efficient way .
&quot; JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG in the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also store los@@ s@@ less if specified in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to learn more about the raw image format , please refer to Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful guides in English . you can convert raw format images into JPEG or TI@@ FF with the raw image converter of &amp; digi@@ kam . in the section Con@@ figuration you will find more information about the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports loading raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is included in &amp; digi@@ kam ; all support cameras can be viewed at the bottom of the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats that are supported by &amp; digi@@ kam ; supported : &quot;

many tools you need to do the editing are included in &amp; digi@@ kam ; your description will follow here .
&quot; all image editing tools such as sharpen@@ ing , sof@@ ten@@ ers , noise suppression , re@@ focus , un@@ sharp mas@@ king , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog type that displays the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you can see &amp; quot ; texture User quot ; in this dialog : &quot;
( 1 ) : this progress bar displays the status of the filter on the current picture . to the left of it five buttons allow to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
vertical parts without dup@@ licate . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the field on the right of the selected preview area .
&quot; horizont@@ ally , without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper area shows the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area . &quot;
the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
the upper part shows the original and the lower to compare the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; style : displays the preview if the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn on to display over@@ exposure and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame for selecting the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and place on the part of the image you want to preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings of the last use of the module will be noted .
the page bar features the essential information on the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is grouped in the following sections :
photo properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data come from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
&quot; this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can zoom in or out with the mouse wheel or hold it hold . press C@@ trl , left mouse button to move a square . of course , this requires your pictures to contain ge@@ o data . &quot;
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for Pal@@ ettes files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
&quot; the Pal@@ ettes files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de can be applied either for the whole system or just one user . in the latter case , they are in your Personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user defined color and last used colors . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog palette , you can select from a list of installed pallets or browse the folders for files . &quot;
the cursor is displayed as a line in the pallet view . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
&quot; the color is described below the pallet table view . here , the color name can also be changed . &quot;
&quot; to create such a selection , click the area next to a color to move the cursor there . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the Bei@@ m C@@ ursor keys are selected under the color button , the color will be inserted from the color plate at the cursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the cursor is selected over@@ write . you can set this mode by selecting the check box under the cursor . &quot;
&quot; a selection that was created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions of copying , cutting and past@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color three values for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a new@@ line . if there are three numerical values in the clip@@ board , these can be inserted as one color in &amp; c@@ color@@ edit . &quot;
the colors in the palette and the output of the color choos@@ er can be dra@@ gged with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then you will find them in the color choos@@ er on the left .
&quot; graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . so far , there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graph@@ ene . so far , there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program , which includes &amp; graphi@@ cally ; programs with only a few functions . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ dot ; graphs . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; shows graphs with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; . it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; posters ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change in the graph in &amp; posters ; re@@ comp@@ utes the graph and shows in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; )
menu to open the graph in &amp; posters ; to open or to open the graph in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally ; in a poster ; component
loading large graphs ( currently there are problems starting about 1000 k@@ not and a h@@ ack to show more than these no@@ des )
&quot; further required software : &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program , which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of the graphs . &quot;
&quot; the main window displays the opened graphs , each in its own sub @-@ window . in the beginning , if you start &amp; k@@ gra@@ viewer ; without starting an argument , the main window is empty as in the lower screen@@ shot . in this case , the toolbar will only open the symbol file and open the ( empty ) list of last opened files . click the first icon to open the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; files , the main window looks like in the lower screen@@ shot : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner if the graph is larger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt ; key ) ; &quot;
zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by a factor of 10 . below you can see the maximum reduction of a graph .
&quot; if the downloaded file has been changed from another program , the following window will be displayed : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the graph should be rel@@ o@@ aded or if you want to ignore the change . if you want to change your decision later , you can use the menu item Settings k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; set up ... use , see also . &quot;
&quot; if you want to open a graph file outside a running &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; -@@ instance , or eg ; in the file browser or on the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; k@@ ron@@ viewer ; instance , or to display the graph to be loaded in a sub@@ window of the current instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; when you start the program , you can open all graphs of your last session again . once again , you can save your choice and change it later . &quot;
you can also specify how the graph is to be split into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen .
&quot; if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether or not the parts of the graph that come to a page should be fitted to this page . the aspect ratio is ignored . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled by the respective parts of the graph . &quot;
page preview with a graph divided on several pages with no header and another font
&quot; the Renew@@ able Lo@@ ad site gives you the option to set the behavior when a file has been modified on the hard disk , eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically rel@@ o@@ ad or ignore the changes ) or let the program check each time . &quot;
&quot; the Open page gives the possibility to specify the behaviour of &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; when a graph is opened outside of a current session , you can specify a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub @-@ window of the already running session ) or determine that every time it is asked . &quot;
&quot; the session management page gives you the ability to specify the starting behaviour of &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; you can specify a default behavior ( open or not open the files of the last session or not ) , or specify them to be asked for each start . &quot;
&quot; the context menu , which usually appears when clicking in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; appears , opens up additional options : &quot;
here you can choose between different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z layout algorithms . the entries as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z are :
it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered representations of directed graphs . the algorithm defines the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few edge tri@@ angles as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the default for ung@@ eri@@ ed graphs . it produces representations according to the spring@@ board model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used that is syn@@ onymous with multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
&quot; the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm creates a spring@@ board model for ung@@ eri@@ ed graph@@ ene . it uses the fru@@ ct@@ man @-@ pure gold he@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ grid trigger for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graphs . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm arran@@ ges the no@@ des in a circular way according to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multi @-@ cycli@@ c structures . &quot;
&quot; open a dialog where you can specify a layout command , which is then executed by a shell . the command should accept the graph file as a parameter , and specify the calculated layout of the graph after st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command , you can give &amp; eg ; the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; algorithms to change the graph with a filter before it is drawn . &quot;
determines the type of graph ( directed or executed ) and applies the standard algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for directed , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for non @-@ executed graph ) . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is enabled , the overview will be displayed if necessary . otherwise , it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active . &quot;
displays the What is the mouse poin@@ ter . click on a &amp; GUI element with this mouse poin@@ ter to get more help to this element ( if available ) .
a list of changes is available at this address and in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the base folder of the source repository .
&amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that uses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tools for representation . it requires the following program packages :
&quot; a special setup is not necessary to use &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; in the Settings menu , you will find more options . &quot;
&quot; the main window of the symbol editor is divided into five sections : the main toolbar , the bar for drawing tools , the status bar , the .@@ color palette and the grid in which you draw the symbol . &quot;
&quot; a new icon creates a new icon . if the current file has been changed , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save the changes . after that a dialog appears where you can choose whether the icon should be created from a template , or whether you want to restart from scratch . &quot;
&quot; restore the last revers@@ ed step . if you haven &apos;t made a step back , this feature is disabled . &quot;
inserts the clip@@ board content as a new image ( if the clip@@ board contains a symbol ) .
sets the current symbol in gre@@ y@@ scale . this can create colors that do not match those of the symbol palette of &amp; k@@ de ; match .
&quot; does not change the symbol , but sets the current character color to the color of the point you click . &quot;
&quot; the status bar shows you the current actions . from left to right , it shows you the x@@ - and y @-@ coordinates of the current pixel , the size of the current drawing area , the magni@@ fication factor and the current number of colors of the symbol . &quot;
inserts the clip@@ board content as a new image ( if the clip@@ board contains a symbol ) .
&quot; open with Settings &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; set up a dialog with the three pages templates for symbols , background and symbol grid . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons Add ... , Edit ... and Rem@@ ove you can modify the templates for default file , source file , Com@@ pressed File &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; choose Transpar@@ ent Pixel or Display Lin@@ e@@ ale and set one color : or a ch@@ ess@@ board as a transparency display . you can also adjust for the chess board the size : the diamonds on small , medium and large as well as the color 1 : and color 2 : choose . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I Module Images are available to read new pictures and save them .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . at present two sources can be used :
scan images : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner which is supported by the San@@ e project or another source such as Video Stre@@ ams . to do this you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
&quot; when you open the menu entry , a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to pick the picture . you can also set the default source for the next time . &quot;
&quot; after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window will appear when you can replace the default values in your image . view the preview and adjust the range to your needs before using the button scanning the image . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , lower corner . &quot;
&quot; make sure the window will be completely displayed , as some settings may not be displayed otherwise . &quot;
&quot; after you have pressed the button scanning , you have to wait until the scan is complete and the type of image file will appear . please remember that the type BM@@ P does not comp@@ ress and therefore creates very large files . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image by saving the image . &quot;
screen@@ shots you can create after you have selected the screen@@ shot in the Im@@ por@@ tier &gt; Screen photo . a window appears where you can set the different screen photo modes :
select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
&quot; if all of your own program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear , so that you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible work@@ station . &quot;
&quot; the delay determines how long the screen shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other work surfaces , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there . &quot;
&quot; after the screen@@ shot has been made , the dialog box options appear with the options already described above . &quot;

Fli@@ ck@@ r is an online photo management on the Internet . Fli@@ ck@@ r makes it possible to show photos to people that are important to you . you can show your favorite photos in the world to show photos of your camera and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and family around the world .
the module ex@@ porting to Fli@@ ck@@ r can be used to upload images from your computer to a Fli@@ ck@@ r server on the Internet .
&quot; if you use the module for the first time , you will be guided by the process of generating a token . this will be used for your authentication . so it is your ID to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser is launched to enable you to login to Fli@@ ck@@ r . &quot;
&quot; after successful registration , the module can send photos to the Fli@@ ck@@ r website . the following page will be presented to you after a successful registration . &quot;
&quot; simply close the browser window and return to the program . once you have pressed Yes , you will get the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section . &quot;
&quot; when the module ex@@ porting to Fli@@ ck@@ r is started for the second time , you will be greeted with the following dialog , which displays the current access permissions that the module displays . currently , you do not need any other permissions . you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions . &quot;
&quot; the button Add photos should be pressed once you have set all other options . with this button , you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . when you press the O@@ k button , up@@ loading the photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r Server starts . &quot;
the keywords array can be filled with a list of words separated by comm@@ a . these are added to the image as tags during upload .
&quot; with options Public , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ ly , you can set the permissions to your pictures . by default , the photos are classified as private . &quot;
&quot; if you select the option change the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos will be changed before up@@ loading in size . the size is taken from the value registered at maximum size . &quot;
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module Gallery Export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I Module Gallery Export currently has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : participants in this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographic data are stored in the EX@@ IF keywords of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization provides tools to loc@@ alize images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the spher@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length and l@@ atitude are used . &quot;
to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data you need a GPS trace as an XML file in GP@@ X format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and go to the menu . the above dialog appears then . to get a possible correlation over time and location , you need to load a track file with GP@@ X file . of course , this file contains data that were recorded at the same locations in the same locations as the pictures of your camera . &quot;
&quot; if the file is loaded an automatic correlation performs the coordinates in red . GPS trace data are recorded in GMT time , so the camera coverage must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone . set your camera zone here . &quot;
&quot; the setting for the maximum time deviation gives an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera coverage . if the deviation is below below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds . &quot;
if you do not have any trace data from one place you can manually edit the GP@@ X file and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all the images in this area .
&quot; the inter@@ pol@@ ation options and difference in minutes can be used if you don &apos;t have the right data . if you know that in reality a location is located between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ related to inter@@ pol@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos in the same place . since the dialog opens the coordinates from one call to the next , you only need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the location can also be found and set with the displayed map . select the respective region and enlarge it again , until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the height must always be selected manually . the card can be changed between card mode , satellite image and mixed mode . &quot;
&quot; completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are ways to attach the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that uses the exi@@ ft@@ ool to tag a stack of images with GPS data . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I Module Picture Gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded UT@@ F @-@ 8 to allow for the best possible internation@@ alization .
&quot; the choice allows you to select all albums that are to be exported to HTML . you will not need to select these albums hierarch@@ ically . with the three buttons on the right , you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below it will appear the Al@@ ben@@ preview and the text that will appear in the header of the HTML page . &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ der Ap@@ pear@@ ance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self explan@@ atory . if you click on a picture a new page will be opened in which the image is displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your standard image viewer , eg ; C@@ ick@@ show , &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ der Album defines the settings and how to store the gallery with all your related images . to do this , select a folder on which you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ X@@ Export that contains everything will be created there . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the JPEG format , the EX@@ IF information of your original pictures will also be stored in the new pictures . &quot;
&quot; with other color depth you can change the default color depth . of course , this also influences the file size . all other settings are self explan@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; the tab thumb@@ nails allows you to customize some of the settings from the Album tab for thumb@@ nails , which are small images that are displayed in the gallery . &quot;
a progress window displays the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to break the process .
&quot; if the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . therefore , you can read the program messages to see if there occurred errors during production . the web browser is automatically started to view the preview of the gallery . press C@@ lose to close the module . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool for viewing images .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rotation , zo@@ oming or sliding . the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse buttons . it has been developed for quick picture display and quick access to its functions . &quot;
&quot; after the start , an image is displayed as standard in full screen mode . this can be changed into a window mode . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ less module is a tool for changing images without affecting your quality .
&quot; this module allows to save images in JPEG format for the actions below , without the usual quality or metadata loss . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of los@@ s@@ less storage is that the file size is increased , as no compression of the color information takes place . for example , this can be found in the P@@ NG format . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I digital camera client is a tool that allows you to connect your computer with a digital camera .
&quot; if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : participants in this list will speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module Met@@ adata Editor does not have any documentation currently . if you want to change this situation please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
&quot; with the Import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then go to the Import function . this will then open the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image . &quot;
&quot; this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write to any destination format . JPEG is supported while writing . please check out to see which formats are supported . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ ver Module is a tool to convert a number of images to a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
the module MPEG Ko@@ di@@ ver can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video with a defined length . this module uses the Pack@@ ages M@@ j@@ peg Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck . between the individual images you can add a basic image transition . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the sli@@ deshow .
&quot; all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . additionally , you can select a background color for your DVD player . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program . &quot;
you first have to select the images which are to be packed into the MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au . after that you can create the module via Extras MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au .
&quot; the images you select are then listed under image files in the Portfolio . there , you can also change sorting of the pictures or the contents of the list . &quot;
&quot; the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you are planning to re@@ play the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds to indicate a picture . the speed of the image transition is set below . a low value creates very sudden , a high contrast very smooth image change . &quot;
&quot; the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should leave it black . you can specify the name and path of the file created under name of the MPEG output file . &quot;
&quot; if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . once you have adjusted all settings to your wishes , you can start the creation of the movie with the encoding button . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now quickly or in all tranqu@@ ill@@ ity enjoy a coffee and enjoy the sli@@ deshow once you are back . &quot;
&quot; if a note appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the m@@ j@@ peg@@ s and Image@@ Magi@@ ck packages via the button settings below . &quot;
the print assistant allows printing several images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined pictures can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.g. : useful to improve you or print it with the Gim@@ p module for direct printing .
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import or convert your images stored in RAW file into one of three formats JPEG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM . &quot;
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from him is : do not expect from d@@ sc@@ w not to create the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get better results with d@@ sc@@ w ! .
first select the RAW file to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter Window will then appear in mode for a single image . with the Pre@@ view button you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
&quot; you can now adjust the values to adjust the conversion process . the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for white balance . the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later . &quot;
&quot; a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch does not have any effect . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the fil@@ en@@ ame will remain the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ s@@ less algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it . &quot;
&quot; the Tagged image format , TI@@ FF , retains all the information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ less LZ@@ W compression . &quot;
&quot; if you plan to edit your pictures frequently or otherwise you should not use the JPEG format , since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality is deterior@@ ated . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG as a storage format , the metadata that contains in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the ex@@ if information . &quot;
&quot; if you have customized your settings , you can start the conversion with the Run button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; batch processing mode allows you to convert various images at one time . so use this mode if you are certain , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , you have the possibility to over@@ ride existing file automatically . however , this is helpful if they were created in a previous attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progres@@ sed . &quot;
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album . &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of several images of a picture collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package .
&quot; proportional ( 1 D@@ im ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; proportional ( 2 D@@ im ) : res@@ izing in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . for example , you can use this option to adjust your image to the screen format . &quot;
not proportional : not proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed by this option .
&quot; print Pre@@ par@@ ation : prepares the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , border size and background color , will be adjusted accordingly . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images you want .
&quot; after you have started the module , the pictures window will be displayed with the pictures you select . you can add more pictures through the Edit button . for the most recently selected image , you will see a preview on the right @-@ hand side . &quot;
you can also drag images to the image list and drop them to add the list of images to be sent .
removing images will remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent .
after you have selected all the images you can open the New Message @-@ window of your e @-@ mail client with the OK button . you only have to add the addresses and the subject . the pictures you select are attached as attachments .
don &apos;t be sure to send too many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations for the size of e @-@ mails sent . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and used every time you change it .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field below . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail service , you must install the G@@ mail agent on your computer before . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after adding comments in an attached file , the comments will be added to the images in a text file and attached the mail . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ NG format under the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to los@@ s@@ less formats like TI@@ FF . you should therefore use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend the JPEG format . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG by image file format and are the original files in JPEG format , then the original export data will be added to the images to be sent . &quot;
&quot; if the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically so you can view the status messages , in search of errors , but your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end . &quot;
&quot; after starting the Advanced Di@@ ash@@ au module , a window with questions like you want to display your slide show will appear . you can choose between the selected and all images of the album . &quot;
&quot; the Open@@ GL transitions in the presentation enable very elegant image transitions using Open@@ GL . however , you must have a corresponding graphic card , since otherwise the slide show will be very slow . &quot;
the option file name indicates that the file name of the images appears in the lower left corner of the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in an infinite loop . you can then manually cancel with Es@@ c ; cancel .
the option images random@@ ly select ensures that the images are displayed in a random order . so it is not used the order of images in the album .
&quot; the distance between the images can be set between the images . 1500 ms correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . &quot;
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly select a different effect in each transition between the images .
&quot; during the slide show , you can access a toolbar at the top left edge of the screen . move the mouse to this corner to turn it on . &quot;
&quot; with this toolbar , you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous one and stop the slide show . &quot;
&quot; at the left bottom of the screen , you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ame , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : participants in this list will speak English . &quot;
the background image of the K@@ IP@@ I module is a tool for setting a picture as background image for the work surface .
&quot; this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub @-@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations , you can browse them with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; by these brow@@ ses , see picture . as you can see by comparing with the image , you are now present in each group , so in people , places and in the group keywords entries . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window you will see the categories for which you have entered information when you have submitted your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in addition , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course to view the current preview images . &quot;
&quot; when you press the mouse on the record , the browser view changes . see picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select another person , only the pictures are displayed on which both people are visible . through this selection method you can restrict the number of pictures displayed by a few thousand images to a few images . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected all persons , places and other settings , you can display thumb@@ nails to view the images of your area of activity . &quot;
&quot; in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of her name . you can save with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person you can save your own thumb@@ nail , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories you have defined yourself . &quot;
&quot; to view images next to the names , select the button located on the right side of the toolbar . in the pop @-@ up context menu , you can select which view you want to use for the current category . this has the advantage that you can display symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have suitable images for your keywords ) . &quot;
&quot; you have to decide for yourself which image is to be displayed for each individual person . to do this , you will need to open the image @-@ view window ( described in more detail ) and select the image for the corresponding person . you can adjust the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the search in the main window , you will see a dialog that is very similar to the dialog for setting the picture properties . you can view this dialog once again . &quot;
&quot; if you enter a string in the label or description field , you can also enter a date you want to search for ; the date can be either a part of the total date , e.g. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all the images by certain names , as you can see in the picture . here you will see images on which Jes@@ per , however , not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you don &apos;t like to read manuals , but rather want to try out functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to the home page of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and take a look at the fast entry , the screen@@ shots and the introduction videos . &quot;
&quot; start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog , select the demo in case you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select the menu entry C@@ photo@@ album ; demo . after that , some sample images will be loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coherent HTML document to download . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . you can see a picture of this strip here : . as the name suggests , this list shows you date statistics about the images in your database . &quot;
&quot; you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying only 10 @-@ minute sections . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed view view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image of this date is displayed in the preview image ) and the tim@@ eline always displays the current date of the currently displayed pictures when you navigate in the preview pane . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a range of time bar by holding down the mouse button and dra@@ gging the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time information . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a tim@@ eline bar . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you with two ways to create HTML pages with your images . one is in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other available as module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual , the in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version is described that you can access through the menu file HTML ... &quot;
&quot; before creating HTML pages , you need to make some adjustments . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and target . in the following , each section is described more accurately . &quot;
first enter the title of the overview and a description that should contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML example pages you can see an example of these settings .
next select if a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file is to be created which is to be seen on the overview page .
&quot; last but not least , you can choose which information is displayed on the HTML pages . in this way , you can avoid that information is displayed to the viewer without a description . for example , that all pictures are from a party . note that all pictures are from a party . &quot;
&quot; in this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why it is not specifically dealt with . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . this means that those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 will not download images , for example a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you have specified . so it can search your images with low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time . if you want to get an image larger , it changes to a higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setting , place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored . &quot;
&quot; best select a base folder for all your HTML files , and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set . &quot;
&quot; first you have to select the root folder in which all your images will be saved . this folder will be saved and automatically added next time . this allows you to select a folder or a folder supported by K@@ DE , for example : &quot;
&quot; once you have created your images , you can check if they really are all visible to viewers . if you choose a URL for the base folder , a web browser after the pages have been created . the URL you specify here should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you need to manually copy them to them . so that the import function , see , work correctly you must specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located . &quot;
&quot; the settings that are just described have moved all three to base folders and URLs . in them , a sub@@ folder will be created , whose name you specify in output folders . &quot;
&quot; if you are interested in a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; together , you might want to create your pictures with these . however , if you have spent quite a lot of time for viewing the pictures , people on the pictures , recording location , etc . , then you have to do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this work will not do even more . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your pictures into a .@@ k@@ im file , which can import others into your database . &quot;
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or if the file is only a link to images . the advantage of saving all the images into the file is that you can have all the pictures together , but the obvious draw@@ back is the file size . &quot;
&quot; you can either export a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the File menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file looks for the images in two ways . first , it searches the images that are located in the .@@ k@@ im file directory . if the corresponding images are not found , then the images of the URL you specified when creating the HTML files will be searched . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file with HTML export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog for ex@@ porting images is described which you can access through the File Ex@@ porting ... menu . &quot;
the main option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
&quot; if you want to copy manually to the .@@ k@@ im file , copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
with the option Autom@@ atically to copy the .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the images automatically for you .
&quot; .@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most images have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worth to comp@@ ress the files . if you want to do so , simply select the export file option . &quot;
&quot; the last option of this page is maximum image size . if you send pictures to your friends , you may not want to send the pictures in full size , as the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
&quot; if you select a file with extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File Im@@ porting menu ... select , it will import &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in described . &quot;
&quot; the wizard to import consists of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , then into which folder the im@@ porting images should be copied . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you person@@ alize the category Person@@ s of the imported file ( if you are a domain ) , while this category is in your database people . therefore , you will be asked in the third dialog box to import the categories of the imported file and which categories these categories are in your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can compare the categories of the imported file with the categories of your present database . an example of this can be seen in the picture . &quot;
&quot; it has to be easy to browse and view images : if you see pictures , you often want to jump inside of different picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; for example , if you look at pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend on it , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted . &quot;
&quot; in this manual you will see the various steps taken from ( 1 ) Set the information about your pictures , via ( 2 ) the browsing and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced themes and custom@@ ization options . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ Album has been started as a program for managing your pictures . however , it has been expanded and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual you will talk about pictures , but often this also includes videos . &quot;
&quot; this is a simple XML file that you can use with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a flo@@ ppy or re@@ visions in the CVS , where they want . &quot;
&quot; if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for example , start with -@@ c . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / Company / Pictures / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; in the following section of the user manual , the different settings are explained in the following section of the user manual . &quot;
&quot; to the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can access the settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available which you can access by pressing the F1 key and clicking on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; you can also define your own groups such as objects , animals or albums for each image . &quot;
&quot; see the dialog used to process existing groups . for each group , you can select a label and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in the section sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the Options dialog you can set up complete member groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a member as explained in . &quot;
&quot; in the selection list above , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left half of the window you will find a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares its modular system with other graphics applications , such as digi@@ ti@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . &quot;
&quot; the modules can be accessed through the modules menu . the modules can and will not be described in this manual , as they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can access through the modules itself . &quot;
&quot; because the modules are shared by multiple applications together , it can be that the modules were tested with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; only very little has been tested . therefore , you should always test new modules with the demo database before using them using the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ Demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the Help menu . &quot;
&quot; the applications using the modules via K@@ IP@@ I are very different , making it possible that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not work . this is the disadvantage when sharing functions with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I is that the other applications are simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order does not support , it simul@@ ates for some modules the order for albums , so you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; &quot;
&quot; this simul@@ ates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which simply corresponds to the current view , so all the pictures you see at the moment . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the latest album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also have to give a list of albums . this is &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows : &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser shows the contents of a category , for example all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you use the category Person@@ s , for example , you will use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so , if you have selected people to view and share this with the module . &quot;
&quot; since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the settings dialog and select modules to load modules . &quot;
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with your own pictures .
&quot; under the toolbar , you will see the window with which you can browse your picture database . in the section we will show you no information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to mark each picture with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons depicted on the picture , where the picture was taken . if for example on all images Jes@@ per is pic@@ tured and all pictures taken in Copenhagen are included . &quot;
&quot; all these notes can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want , you can see these notes when using the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; you can see three lists in a text field by setting up people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; since you will always use them again when you enter information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; the following idea is to post@@ p@@ one the pictures inside the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and shown on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons , you can , by that the names used are moved up , to find and assign the persons more quickly . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the icon for sorting by date under the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected notes for each image individually , you may want to edit all the selected pictures and ann@@ ot@@ ate them with ann@@ ot@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; if you have recorded multiple images , e.g. with the same person , it can be more convenient to mark all of these images and use the menu item Sever@@ al entries at once with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles , and California are all in the U.S. . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles lie in California . &quot;
&quot; in the picture you can see a browser window that shows the USA as an over@@ board . to show you that it is a super@@ group , a special symbol is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the comment dialog &apos;s context menu , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new category or sub@@ category . additionally , you can drag an entry into a category and place it in order to make it an sub@@ category of this entry . note , this assumes that you just sort your categories alphabe@@ tically . &quot;
&quot; you can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking on the bar , which form the top edge of the frame , click and move it . you can also create your own window from a frame by dra@@ gging it outside the window area . &quot;
&quot; if you have adjusted the appearance of the window so adapted to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings , click the Options button ... which allows you to save the current layout and appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also om@@ it a frame completely . if you want to see this window again later , use the Options button ... and then hide / hide the window . you will see this process in the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select the entry pictures in the browser , you will get an overview of preview images of the currently selected images , or all images in case you have not set a filter . you can see the size of thumb@@ nails , by simply dra@@ gging the mouse with the middle mouse button , and try it . &quot;
&quot; if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image will be set as background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you click on a picture , it will be shown in the image viewer . if you have not opened a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created . &quot;
you can also delete pictures in the preview window . simply select the respective images you want to delete and press either the Rem@@ ove button or select Del@@ ete from the Edit menu . now the window will be displayed that you can see in the picture .
&quot; you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the picture you have to store the pictures somewhere , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard drive . &quot;
&quot; images , in which the right upper corner is trun@@ cated , are not stored on the hard disk . however , the thumb@@ nails are present for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also view these images with the image viewer . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , this feature requires you to copy files from the folders and then copy them back into it . so if you want to avoid anno@@ y@@ ance , how to avoid the mess@@ ing up of your pictures , please buy a larger hard disk to save all images . &quot;
&quot; in the pictures menu you will find a sub@@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the pictures so that at the end those who want to see your little sister can control and click on the menu entry everything except current view . &quot;
&quot; you have specified which pictures should be hidden in the case of the case . if you want to give the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu entry pictures , so that all the images you have locked will be hidden . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to specify a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select password in the privacy menu . &quot;
&quot; please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very secure . on the one hand , all pictures on the hard disk and on the other anyone can access the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml , the password as un@@ encrypted text can be read out or deleted . this type of password protection serves only for those who are familiar with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar with the view of private images . &quot;
&quot; the reason why you all want your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and describe hours for hours with it is natural that you want to see them sometime . for this reason , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; via a picture _ and video viewer . you can start it from the preview as described in . &quot;
&quot; the viewer , of course , shows the picture , but additional all the information you have entered through the image , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if you want to see the information box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , you can simply drag it with the mouse and put it elsewhere . you can also configure which information is displayed and whether information is displayed at all . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer . the then appearing context menu can be viewed below . &quot;
&quot; some words in the Info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here , the browser , see the matching entries for this . so if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had chosen persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have loaded multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image up and down . you can jump to the first and last picture with pos@@ 1 and end . these functions can also be accessed from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slide show . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then loads a new image after a few seconds . how often it can load a new image by pressing the C@@ trl key and plus or minus . &quot;
&quot; a very useful capability of the viewer of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is it possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete place on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back . &quot;
&quot; if you can use the viewer , you can zoom in and zoom in . to zoom out , you can zoom in with the mouse . with the Min@@ us button , you can zoom back out The Plus button zo@@ omed to the center of the image . &quot;
&quot; with the dot button , you can reset your zoom so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the &quot; &quot; equal button &quot; &quot; the zoom , so that every pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image . &quot;
note that the only zoom operations that work in videos will work in and out with the plus and sub @-@ key .
&quot; with the shooting features from the context menu , you can rotate the image . this does not work for videos . you can make comments on the current image using the menu item ann@@ ot@@ ation from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when you look at pictures it can happen that you find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the image . at the moment you can view the image and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter these names . however , you may prefer to select only the image and view more pictures . &quot;
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer to get the images developed on paper . to see what photos you want , you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while watching one by one . &quot;
&quot; for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to add pictures with characteristics while you view them . features are the letters A to Z and you can bet a feature by pressing the corresponding letter . in the picture you see a picture where the characters A , B and C. &quot;
&quot; this is described in detail . after that , you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do . &quot;
&quot; categories and particular features can be displayed in the preview screen . if you can see categories in the image preview , you can add characteristics to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image was selected . you can see this here : &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case you will be allowed to paint on the picture .
&quot; the mixture is not saved with the image , but in the database . &quot;
in order to turn on the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; switch on the painting from the context menu . to finish the painting you simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window .
&quot; to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you must not fully control the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; but the documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray , should be read and understood . &quot;
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is shown in the wire mode views yellow .
&quot; you can also select multiple objects at the same time , but not the object of an already selected object as all objects are already selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the toolbar , or select a menu entry in the In@@ sert menu . &quot;
&quot; if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will be displayed to allow you to choose the correct position : &quot;
&quot; with del@@ eting either from the menu bar under Edit , or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can remove selected objects from the scene . &quot;
&quot; if you have changed properties , click App@@ ly to take these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with a fault description . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the path to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; User documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation . &quot;
&quot; when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the property view . &quot;
&quot; preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as default the whole texture is rendered , even if you want to render only a part of the texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , tick local . &quot;
the screen@@ shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and thus change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and there will be a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by dra@@ gging with the mouse within the entire window . &quot;
each object has a Visi@@ bility Level as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the level of view of the parent object or as absolute value . objects are displayed only when they are selected or their Visi@@ bility level is smaller or equal to the level chosen in the toolbar .
&amp; k@@ olo@@ v model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right .
&quot; if you don &apos;t like the standard window arrangement or if you need a different arrangement , you can set it as you like . you can also store multiple windows and switch between different arrangements . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window above or below an existing view , drag the p@@ asser to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then displays the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the p@@ asser to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to arrange several views over one another , drag the p@@ asser in the middle of another view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the card pi@@ cker on top of the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not anchored in the main window . to solve a view from anch@@ oring , drag the fan to the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing to the left in the bar . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the address bar . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross . &quot;
&quot; you can insert additional views into the main window . in the View menu you will find entries for any type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them anywhere . &quot;
you can save the current window view with the view of the window arrangement ... to save it . a dialog appears where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name .
&quot; if you have created a scene , you can render them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to render , this program must be properly installed . as this manual was written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported . &quot;
&quot; to render the current scene , click on the Ren@@ dering icon The Ren@@ dering icon in the toolbar or select the menu entry view scene render . &quot;
&quot; an R@@ ender mode corresponds to entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of the rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many render modes , from a quick preview to full pictures of the highest quality . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar , or select View R@@ ender Mo@@ di ... the following dialog will be opened : &quot;
&quot; each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but useful is a name that can detect the properties of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the size of the map , you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the check box sub@@ section and enter the image cut@@ out for rendering to the input fields . &quot;
&quot; in combination with quality , you can choose the properties that &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; used for rendering . this comes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflection light . a detailed description of the R@@ ender features can be found in the User Manual &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . &quot;
&quot; these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or tier effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than one pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of this error . generally , pictures with this feature are better . &quot;
&quot; when you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as a standard is an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adaptive because the super @-@ sampling uses the adjacent pixels . the second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively because each pixel will be split up again and again because the rec@@ tor depth depends on the calculated color values . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a beam per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the defined threshold , then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 5 x@@ 5 ( 25 ) will calculate additional beams per pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : r 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . &quot;
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are individually followed and checked for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be set with the depth value . &quot;
&quot; another possibility to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the creation of noise for the ray process , called J@@ it@@ tering . if you turn on j@@ it@@ tering , change &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
the last setting for the quality of ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light reflection will be calculated . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property .
&quot; on this map , you can adjust whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is transparent when the related rays have not hit the object . &quot;
&quot; opens a new window for the ad of the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly finished , you can find the reason for it here . &quot;
&quot; to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; scene , select File Im@@ ported ... and select a file in the dialog box . &quot;
&quot; currently supported &amp; k@@ post model@@ er ; not yet the full set of commands &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . when im@@ porting error messages or warnings , a dialog box displays a list of all messages . &quot;
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ .dll ; you want to import this source code between the two particular comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
&quot; you can drag objects from the object tree into the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray . this adds to the source code of the object into the open text file in the editor . to import objects to the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree . &quot;
with copying and past@@ ing in &amp; k@@ post model@@ er ; and in your editor you can insert source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ;
the POV @-@ Ray command is called if &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
&quot; click Help in Properties View , open &amp; k@@ post model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; User Docum@@ entation to the displayed object . follow the path to your document and the version . supports versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example al@@ field data ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the scene folder , you also need to add the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file will be used . &quot;
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the viewing field in the camera view and in the window type marks .
&quot; you can set the object reception of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . here you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; larger values result in a more precise wire model and therefore better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time to render . for some objects such as the ball , you can set the detail level separately for two directions . &quot;
&quot; if you cross high level of detail for extended projections , all wire model views are further sub@@ divided when the camera uses extended projection . extended projections are all projections with exceptions to the perspective and vertical projections . this feature creates a better rap@@ proch@@ ement for projections , but requires more time to render . &quot;
&quot; if you cross a wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is displayed in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colours . &quot;
&quot; when you cross the floor , a floor below the objects is rendered . the floor is shown in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colours . &quot;
&quot; if you tick edge smooth@@ ing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold value . you can find more detailed information about the parameters in the R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di section . &quot;
&quot; on this page you can modify existing window arrangements , or create new window arrangements . in the Window Reg@@ ulations section , it will be explained how to create and store window arrangements . &quot;
the Standard Window System combination panel : displays all existing window arrangements . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window arrangement when starting the program .
the list of existing window frames displays all existing window arrangements . a new arrangement can be created by clicking the Add button and del@@ eting a selected arrangement with the Del@@ ete button .
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list under the name shows all the views for the selected window arrangement . new views can be created by clicking the Add button and del@@ eting selected views with the Del@@ ete button .
&quot; with New column create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with Un@@ ten anchor the window under the existing window , with card card you get a card card view together with the previous view and floating the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you have just &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without more detailed knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a sphere on one level . &quot;
&quot; but you should heed the following warnings before you complain that as a result , you only get a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied for rendering , as a result you get a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you get only a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you have installed everything correctly , you will see at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following default window arrangement : &quot;
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the toolbar . please read the documentation so that you can get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
&quot; you will need to use these menus and symbols frequently , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application . &quot;
&quot; to follow this guide , first you need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the Edit Del@@ ete menu item , so you now have a scene without objects . &quot;
&quot; the wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene you generate . in particular , you notice that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene . &quot;
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the contents of the object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the User Docum@@ entation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; find more details . &quot;
&quot; do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera in the view has control points with which you can change the target point of the camera . simply click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired location . &quot;
&quot; if you apply the application button or push the Enter key , the wire model views and the object tree immediately change according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the camera &apos;s point of view . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . for example , you could insert a header ( insert final body Qu@@ ader ) and adjust the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some way to solve this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ post model@@ er ; actually offers a simpler option . you can use an infinite plane as a floor :
&quot; a good advice : select the layer in the object tree , change the name and then press the App@@ ly button or enter the Enter key . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately . &quot;
&quot; the wire model view now also shows the level , although at the moment only as a fin@@ ite layer . if you render the scene , the level expands to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; in this case , you will find only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation , and displacement . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the object &apos;s view . &quot;
&quot; in this scene you should move the floor to the exercise a unit below the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . select shift and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something simple at the moment . &quot;
&quot; in both cases , a dialog opens where you can select how the object is to be inserted . the pigment will then be displayed in the object tree . you can change the name in the property view ( name = base pigment ) , with a click on the button preview you see how the pigment now looks . &quot;
&quot; of course , the pre@@ views of the pig@@ ments only show a matt black material because you have to enter the pig@@ ments settings at any time . therefore , always remember that you can preview the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t see any color on Qu@@ ader and Ball in the preview , click on the App@@ ly button and then go to the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you ren@@ ders your picture with a click on the symbol , you should receive the following result : &quot;
&quot; in the color list you need to enter two new attributes , called one color . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more often , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , select one color each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties : &quot;
&quot; you should be able to do this step by step , since you should have understood the basic functionality of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the ball can be created just as easy as the floor : &quot;
&quot; in the view of the object properties , you can instantly change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget the input button or the user button ) , so the ball would float above the ground as you moved the ground around one unit down@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; of course , the rendering now creates a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . &quot;
&quot; if you have chosen the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as with the ground , give the ball a pigment as a color : &quot;
&quot; select First Sign and change the name for example in Or@@ al Pig@@ ment . click on the Pig@@ ment ball , then select Uni@@ coloured and set the values as follows : &quot;
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish properties :
then change the values as shown in the following screen@@ shots and click App@@ ly or press the Enter key .
&quot; the settings shine @-@ effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metallic : not even selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good idea of what possibilities you have and k@@ rep@@ v model@@ er ; hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple , but nice scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
&quot; when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing a scene , the ren@@ derer moves hyp@@ othe@@ tical rays from the viewer &apos;s perspective ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through every pixel in the scene . the render calcul@@ ates how this beam is reflected by the objects and how atmospheric effects like for example fog work . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source you see also nothing , the picture is just black . obviously , every scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the default file dialog you can select a file you previously created with &amp; k@@ post model@@ er ;
&quot; whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already saved the model , it will be saved under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and disk space . &quot;
reco@@ vers the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are dis@@ car@@ ded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you still have un@@ saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last rever@@ ted command . this menu entry can only be selected if you have used editing re@@ trac@@ ting .
saves the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing arrangement .
&quot; in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ post model@@ er ; , here you can change the look , the short@@ cuts and the default behavior . &quot;
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can modify or add default short commands for &amp; k@@ post model@@ er commands with this option .
opens a dialog to set up the toolbar . you can add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er with this option ; add and remove commands .
a B@@ ump map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to be individually model@@ ed on the surface without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for a B@@ ump map as well as for a texture map .
basic elements are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are created from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis by applying an image file as a color map .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser where you can select images for viewing .
images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ star@@ Show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can display with clicks of the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the Return key .
&quot; you can specify whether each image should be displayed in a separate window , or whether all images should always use the same window . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a specific file , simply type the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the right lower corner . if an appropriate file name is found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; in dialog Ein@@ ting - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; there are five flash@@ cards . in three of them , General and Processing and Sli@@ deshow , you can set the working method of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show . in the other two short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the short@@ cuts for the respective windows can be set . &quot;
&quot; if the image is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color that you can set further down . default is not full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; if this point is activated , load &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; already the next picture in the folder , while you are still looking at the current picture . this reduces the delay if you choose the next picture , and is especially suitable for a slide show . &quot;
with this option save &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; when moving the name of the last opened folder . at the next start will open &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
&quot; click on the colored bar to select a background color . this is used in order to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in the window mode the window is larger than the image , the background is filled with the selected color . &quot;
&quot; you can set up &amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; set up , that only a few of the file types can be displayed , which can also display the program . &quot;
with this option the display window will be enlarged to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default .
determines whether the sli@@ deshow should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
&quot; to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the sli@@ ders or small arrows to the right of the input field . default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; if this value is set to 0 , the sli@@ deshow will be repeated until it is abor@@ ted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field , or use the small arrows to the right of the input field . default is 1 . &quot;
change the short@@ cuts for the various modes of operation of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser .
&quot; with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ piece view of the file system with folders and files in a window . &quot;
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in short presentation .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in short presentation .
shows thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in short presentation .
the image decreases by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
enlar@@ ges the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; will also be closed if no browser window is open anymore .
display the image in original size . this is only useful if automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
&quot; enter the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected . &quot;
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo editing based on the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image editing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; project .
this is a fast image processing with some powerful base tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
&quot; like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ Photo ; an open source project . this means that the user will contribute to it , at least problems and possible improvements . &quot;
&quot; this displays a dialogue with a link . if you use it , your browser will open a page to report problems and wishes . &quot;
&quot; this means that users and developers will help each other . if you are a frequent user of &amp; show@@ foto , we would like to invite you to join the user mailing list of &amp; show@@ foto ; but you can ask questions to other users of &amp; show@@ foto , but in this mailing list English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful . &quot;
&quot; the best start to participate in a show@@ photo ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list to join . instructions for joining the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ photo ; . &quot;
&quot; in order to access these settings , you need to select the behavior of the show@@ photo ; set up the settings dialog . you can change between them by clicking on the icons on the left . &quot;
&quot; in the field of exposure indicators , you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should display the colors with what you want to display . under@@ exposure should indicate a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color . &quot;
&quot; the main window of the show@@ photo ; has a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides you with important information and actions to the selected pictures . you can also view the same side bar in the image processing . you can view them by clicking on one of the five tab@@ s : &quot;
&amp; cann@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for scanning pictures that no longer does as images to scan and store .
&amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application for scanning pictures that no longer does as pictures to scan and store . &amp; cann@@ l@@ ite ; can open a dialog to save or store the images instantly in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the images before saving .
you can check the status of your scanner support on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
&quot; a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; chant ; with the command chant -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner cannot be opened , or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog for selecting the scanner will be opened . &quot;
&quot; the user can select and press the scanner to use , and press OK to open the scanner . cancel &amp; Canc@@ el . &quot;
the other settings contain more detailed driver options . &amp; chant ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not address these options especially .
&quot; to scan an image , the user can start a preview scan and then select scanning area for the final scan . the preview can be started by previ@@ ewing the scan button . &quot;
&quot; to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also set the zoom in such a way that the complete preview will fit into the window . &quot;
&quot; if the image has been selected , the final image can be read with the scan button . &quot;
&quot; when saving a preview before saving a preview in the settings selected , then the image will be displayed in a preview window , as shown below . when saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and lie ? s leads to a termination and you will get back to the main window . &quot;
&quot; through the Settings button , the name of the same name is opened in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot;
&quot; the user can view the image if desired , before saving . in this case , the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option has to be selected . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows them to select the type such as &amp; channels ; images can be selected . dialog to save for each image opens the dialog before each scann@@ ed image . if &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite , you will need to save it with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to select Save without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; when the images are stored after each scan , then this folder will be used as default for the Save dialog . the default value is your home directory and you can change it by clicking the button ... &quot;
&quot; this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for automatically storing images and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog for saving . the automatically stored image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix , each time a picture is recorded . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers . &quot;
&quot; the user can adjust the image quality used to save . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if you do not select the image quality , then the default value of Q@@ t is used . &quot;
the Help button starts the K@@ DE Help with the &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button About starts the K@@ DE via dialog for &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; . the button Settings displays the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to end &amp; channel .

&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used like all other keyboard short@@ cuts . below you can set up a list of this short@@ cut and its function . the global short@@ cuts can be set up by right @-@ clicking in the player window , and setting up the global short@@ cuts ... Select short commands . &quot;
&quot; you can set up existing multimedia keys so that they function as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; short commands , making your keyboard an &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . &quot;
&quot; the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions that are mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browser , players , playlist , playlist browsers and scripts . &quot;
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; and Amar@@ ok has some own command line options .
&quot; you should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of lack of dependency . please check in your script , if all the required modules are present and use k@@ dialog so that the user knows why a script is not running . &quot;
terms require &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Error Error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE b@@ ind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ deb@@ ind@@ ings V@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit end
&quot; in the scripts / templates folder , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply add them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy . &quot;
&quot; with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command ; any K@@ DE installation should be included . &quot;
most scrip@@ ting languages enable execution of external programs and commands . this is usually done using the ex@@ ec ( ) function . in this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python :
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this purpose , strings are written to the default input of the script . for this reason scripts should monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore events if there is no use for it . &quot;
&quot; configure the script to display the setup dialog . to save and load the setup data , each script needs to take care of itself . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the work folder to the folder where all data should be stored . &quot;
tra@@ ck@@ change sign@@ alizes that a new piece is all@@ u@@ ded . the script could now ask for more information about the new piece using D@@ CO@@ P functions ( for example the metadata or the piece length ) .
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ volume signals a change in volume . the new volume is an int@@ eger value between 0 and 100 .
&quot; custom@@ men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le Path Con@@ tains the path to the selected files of the playlist , if a custom menu entry can be cli@@ cked . to add an entry , you can use the D@@ CO@@ P function d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script re@@ mo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ates , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to perform , for example , storing data or configuration settings . &quot;
Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically regular T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) which can optionally also be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) .
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the gener@@ alization amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should name your script packages correctly . &quot;
&quot; the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the other modules to be loaded should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file permissions : &quot;
if your script package is ready you can attach it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wi@@ ki Skri@@ ll page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your entry to k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
&quot; with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus . maybe you &apos;re looking for a very specific title for thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos; s collection browser and quick search , you will find the piece within seconds . &quot;
&quot; maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which one you want to hear ? then , the playlist browser is just the right thing for you . and if your decision is still difficult , select the dynamic mode and the intelligent play@@ lists automatically select the correct music according to specific criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok has excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . besides , many different audio systems can be used so that YOU can choose how to listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - exactly the right one to experience your music new ! &quot;
usually you have to enter the folder in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
&quot; because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake use , you should have no difficulty in comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report it to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options to enable or disable the configure script for compile time . this is a list of options available . &quot;
&quot; for some of the compile options , certain dependen@@ cies need to be met so that they can be used . details can be found in the System Pre@@ ferences section . &quot;
&quot; you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; help , you should use full . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without difficulty using the setup dialog . the Setup dialog has several flash@@ cards for setting up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
&quot; if the option is switched off , only the playlist window will be displayed . &quot;
use mood bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . the option switches on the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer .
design : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . this will change the color scheme used for the mood bar@@ ometer .
&quot; disc@@ ard files for music files : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files will be stored in the settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; saved ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) . &quot;
external Browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok should be started when a browser is required .
use other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list .
&quot; save Play@@ list when you exit , the current playlist will automatically save when you exit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist when you exit . &quot;
&quot; relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , will be used . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored . &quot;
keep the current piece visible when changing the piece that the play@@ lists pop up / un@@ roll in order to keep the current piece always visible in the visible window area .
changing to context @-@ browser automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is picked up .
in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section you can customize &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s Ap@@ pear@@ ance . the section is divided into three parts .
&quot; in the font section , you can set the use of various fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; use the otherwise gray presented section . you can select fonts for the following range : playlist Window , Player Window , and Con@@ text Browser . click Select ... , so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog . &quot;
&quot; with the Select Custom color scheme , you have the choice of choice and you can set your own color scheme . to do this , use the color sel@@ ector activated , for foreground and background color . &quot;
&quot; continue playing at startup , that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start playback automatically continues with the piece in place with which it was stopped at the last stop . &quot;
&quot; the On @-@ Screen display allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is checked , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly . &quot;
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shade causes the text to be displayed in the O@@ SD .
&quot; using your own colors gives you the possibility to customize the O@@ SD colors for font and background . clicking on the color areas opens the dialog for the color selection . if your own colors are not enabled , the pres@@ et &amp; k@@ de colors are used . &quot;
&quot; the display text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering wild@@ cards , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean . &quot;
&quot; the option screen is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users , so you can specify on which screen of a multi @-@ monitor environment the O@@ SD should appear . &quot;
the flash@@ card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down box . some drivers activate additional adjustments in this card card .
the card @-@ card collection is used to set all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and the type of the database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folder , the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , check the check box next to its name . this section also contains check boxes for setting up how to proceed with the selected folders . &quot;
Browse sub@@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the scann@@ ed as well as their sub@@ folders are searched for music .
&quot; monitor changes : enable &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor selected folders on changes ( for example , if music files are added or deleted ) , an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
import play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; add all found play@@ lists to your collection folder ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will then appear in the playlist browser .
&quot; the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination panel driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further setup in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window is required . &quot;
&quot; the My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup section will be used to set the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; under Calcul@@ ator : will enter the host on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . after that , under Port : the network port is entered under which the database is available . name : is the database name to which the connection is established . &quot;
use User@@ name : and Password : to enter the data needed to connect to the database .
the glass card last@@ .@@ f@@ m provides support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations for the current piece if required .
&quot; enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m site . &quot;
send played pieces and update the profile : this setting allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
you can check the list in the context browser . note : you don &apos;t need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
&quot; Amar@@ ok only needs the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you must have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the included programs , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . &quot;
&quot; some functions such as the O@@ SD pres@@ upp@@ ose that your window manager holds the relevant standards of fre@@ est@@ esk@@ top@@ .@@ or@@ g. Gn@@ ome will work , but flu@@ x@@ box will work for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because these provide an excellent development environment . &quot;
you can locate the file in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also attach the broken file that caused the crash . after that you can delete the file and make the collection again .
mostly it is because tag@@ li@@ b crashes when reading the met@@ a information from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a little more mature . &quot;
&quot; make sure all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries have been compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if , for example , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b compiled with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this leads to crashes when editing the met@@ a information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d , turn off automatic shut@@ down when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least do not use a value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens on a crash ) . if it is a frequently occurring crash , and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error is guaranteed . &quot;
&quot; this is because many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 into the Met@@ a information , but they do not mark them as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script solves the problem . &quot;
&quot; # ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; &quot; file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ mp@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; &quot; error when writing the tags of $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; &quot; $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ; &quot;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b &apos;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s icons in the status bar ( random mode / repetition / dynamic playlist ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known error in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , you can click on a symbol in the Control Center under Ap@@ pear@@ ance Symbols . note that in some cases , you have to click on a symbol until this setting shows its effect . &quot;
&quot; if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ pixel ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then check if Amar@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t . &quot;
&quot; to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will find the correct version first . &quot;
there are several options . most installation problems are most easily resolved by the help of an expert for your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help from other users or developers . use the forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in channel # Amar@@ ok .
&quot; Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for searching for help . please bear in there only one mistake , if something lies in fixing a bug in Amar@@ ok itself . &quot;
&quot; after starting &amp; Amar@@ ok , only a blank playlist appears . how do music pieces come from there ? &quot;
this is easy . use the file browser on the left and open the folder you want . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
&quot; to keep the surface intui@@ tively , the Start sub@@ window was converted to the Statistics window . you will find it under Extras Statistics . &quot;
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars represent the rating by the user while the points are automatically calculated .
&quot; to rate tracks , the playlist must be displayed in the playlist . click on the title bar of the playlist and select &quot; &quot; Show column &quot; . &quot; click anywhere in the new application column to set the rating for one piece . you can also use the short@@ commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . &quot;
select the files you want to remove and then press Del@@ ete on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then choose from playlist removing from the drop down menu .
&quot; drag a playlist file to the playlist by mouse and drop it there , just like you would do it with other files . that &apos;s how easy it is : - ) &quot;
&quot; in the playlist of the playlist , right next to the Add button , you &apos;ll find the Play@@ list button . click on it . &quot;
&quot; probably the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config is missing . install the x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations . &quot;
the equ@@ ali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . you can also find it using the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
&quot; none ! yes , that really is true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses one of the back@@ end independent approach , so the actual question must be Which media types supported G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ MM ? . as you see , we support so pretty much any imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and P@@ NG ! &quot;
&quot; maybe use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which in default does not include MP3 deco@@ ders ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 node , input button &quot;
start the Ya@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s : - )
&quot; if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device has to provide a bl@@ ender . a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and output audio . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware bl@@ ender ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( software mixer ) . &quot;
&quot; the output of this command should help you search for the cause of the problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to provide a different sink ( e.g. air sink ) . &quot;
&quot; do not forget that media must first be de@@ coded . you can &apos;t just send an MP3 to AL@@ SA , you just want a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer is reading the file , deco@@ ding it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can deliver directly to AL@@ SA , just as x@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Sound@@ servers with highest priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper su@@ id is set : &quot;
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia Code@@ cs that can cause distorted reproduction . read this error report . the En@@ large of the Sound pu@@ ffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help well .
&quot; either do not use the Arts driver , but instead use G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia to get the faster Arts co@@ de@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been greatly optimized for analy@@ zers ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes &amp; Amar@@ ok . why ? &quot;
&quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all of the components . &quot;
&quot; read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask the IR@@ C channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; try this ( exit Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then delete all ff@@ m@@ peg files in G@@ Stre@@ amer &apos;s module folder ( you will find the module folder with you @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and execute it again . &quot;
&quot; if you have a complete list of suggestions / wishes , please send them to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album by the Brit@@ on Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . also the name contains the magical K ... : )
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and run the alarm with the alarm : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
&quot; this command leaves &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you will have awak@@ ened by the soft tones of music that you have stopped before going to bed . &quot;
how to get to know the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; running title if you are on another computer ?
&quot; if a working SSH environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command will give you the interpreter and title of the running piece : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ username Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pla@@ ying &quot;
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this assumes that your identification is present in the ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa file .
the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; window . press on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent window in the size modi@@ fiable window .
&quot; the combination of C@@ trl + Right button puts a piece in the click sequence into the queue . by pressing the button after a search in the playlist , the first search result is played and the search is reset . &quot;
&quot; OK , the player window and the playlist have tricky functions , but what about the icon in the system section of the control bar ? &quot;
&quot; on the title of a browser , click on the title of a browser . you can select which browser to display in the context menu . &quot;
&quot; my Personal Fol@@ der $ HO@@ ME is on an NFS drive . after starting Amar@@ ok , the collection database can not be created and there are many error messages appearing on the console . what ? &quot;
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you have to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
&quot; insert the CD , then click on the audio CD in the menu . it opens a file browser with several folders . to normal view switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . instead , take files from the folders mp3 or og@@ g instead . &quot;
&quot; values values = query ( Q@@ String ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , &quot; t@@ CD statistics &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escap@@ e@@ String ( ur@@ l ) ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; basically this fits the previous evaluation with a dimin@@ ishing value based on how often the play was played . the more the play was played , the less impact each individual review has on the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can enter the rating for one piece by right @-@ clicking on a column heading in the playlist window . then , you can change the app@@ rais@@ al of a piece as well as all other attributes , namely by right @-@ clicking on the piece and pressing : selecting Evaluation or pressing F@@ 2 . you can also edit the evaluation in the metadata dialog . &quot;
&quot; the developers don &apos;t want you to specify when you want to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed release plan , which is not connected to the short @-@ term plan of Amar@@ ok . &quot;
&quot; this is a new feature in Amar@@ ok , which some users can find annoying . de@@ activate the option icon when playing animated in the general settings . &quot;
the Analy@@ zer is part of the toolbar . select Settings tool@@ bars to set up ... and take the required modifications there .
&quot; download a design , or create your own . then install it under Amar@@ ok ... Ap@@ pear@@ ance context @-@ browser design , click New Design .... &quot;
&quot; the symbol was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) . to avoid difficulties , it was removed . &quot;
&quot; Kon@@ quer@@ or &apos;s navigation pane allows you to monitor and control &amp; Amar@@ ok ; while browsing the Kon@@ quer@@ or . start Kon@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation pane . then , click the Settings button ( the top ) and select Add Amar@@ ok in the drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
Audi@@ os@@ c@@ robat reader is a free service to the information about which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free of charge and you only need a free user name and password . Audi@@ os@@ c@@ robat is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; supported .
&quot; if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and therefore caused a lot of bug reports . &quot;
probably &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before installing x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore the . / configure routine does not compile these output modules . you need to re@@ configure and install Amar@@ ok .
&quot; now I have &amp; Amar@@ ok ; re@@ installed , but the output modules still do not appear . and now ? &quot;
&quot; you probably need to install the package G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel . the same goes for x@@ ine , you must install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that you need to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . &quot;
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ ICA@@ L * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos;@@ has no type .. How can I fix it ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer has been compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip by mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : do not use L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ ok .
I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 although the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .
&quot; to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module has to be installed next to G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad . &quot;
you will receive the error There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
&quot; you play an MP3 @-@ Stream , but the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ mad module is not installed . install the module and then execute it as a system administrator . then restart Amar@@ ok . &quot;
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use Amar@@ ok the second sound card ?
set up under Settings Amar@@ ok ... Audio output enter the device . typical is e.g. h@@ w : 0 for the default sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here is an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with onboard AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
p@@ cm@@ .@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
&quot; enter us@@ b @-@ audio in the configuration dialog , and the output takes place on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of the conversion of the sample rate , channels and so on . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , disable the tick on sound@@ card supports m@@ map . &quot;
&quot; sorry , but the audio issue with Arts is not taken care of . you can of course take this problem even into your hand ! if you would like , you can become the new much needed assistant for Arts : ) &quot;
&quot; listening to music should be quite easy ! for this reason , there is the setup wizard that will be displayed at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if you want to update your collection afterwards , or simply do not like the wizard , this quick start guide will help you . with your help you will have installed &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in a few minutes . &quot;
&quot; creating a playlist is very simple . drag and drop entries from the collection browser into the playlist . the small text box for filtering the collection makes it easy for you to search for certain pieces . if you &apos;re happy with the playlist , you can save them with the button &apos;s play@@ lists . &quot;
&quot; if you have your own play@@ lists , you can add it to the playlist browser . if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection , and you have enabled the option to im@@ porting play@@ lists , then you can access a playlist by clicking on a playlist . &quot;
&quot; to play an audio CD , please select actions audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with several folders and the CD @-@ pieces in WAV format . drag the WAV files into the playlist and then press the button playback . &quot;
the audio CD function uses the audio CD protocol : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the Bur@@ n function is also available in the playlist . simply click on an entry with the right mouse button and follow the burning menu . you have several options to burn a CD .
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; pres@@ upp@@ oses installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . in addition , some additional packages are listed that make work with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more enjoyable . &quot;
&quot; if you install these packages using a package management system ( eg RPM or apt ) , you must also install the development versions of these packages ! &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a multi @-@ page multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . like any normal multimedia player , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a player window with the most important functions . in addition , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; however , a playlist that can capture and browse your entire music collection . &quot;
&quot; this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used , including creating a collection and a playlist . &quot;
&quot; the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . at the top of the window is a running text display showing the current piece or current stream . directly below is the area , the playing time , bit rate and sample rate of the current piece . a click on this pane changes the display of the already expi@@ red play time to the remaining playing time of the piece . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , also under the running text display . you can switch through the available analy@@ zer by clicking the left mouse button on the pane . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the Player Window . press d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , magni@@ fiable window . &quot;
the PL and E@@ Q buttons are also located under the running text display . the PL knob activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the playlist window while the E@@ Q button is used to set up equ@@ ali@@ zer .
&quot; the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the piece @-@ position slider . use the slider to adjust the play position or volume . with the playback buttons , you can start / stop playback and change to the next or previous piece . &quot;
&quot; using the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 default settings , from classic to techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own pres@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; to display the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use Extras E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you check the equ@@ ali@@ zer button , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation . &quot;
&quot; the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most advanced playlist of all for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia player . it has many features that don &apos;t exist in any other player , but don &apos;t let the abundance of functions deter you , they are all easy to use . &quot;
&quot; you can share the playlist window in two main areas , on the left side is the navigation pane . in the navigation pane you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser . the playlist is easy to use and yet even for advanced users powerful enough . &quot;
&quot; the context @-@ browser displays various information regarding the current piece . its appearance can be adapted with the help of context @-@ browser design . the context @-@ browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and interpreter . &quot;

&quot; with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically record your collection once you change something to the selected folders . if you own many pieces , this might take a while . &quot;
&quot; directly below the toolbar , there is a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . notes to use this filter can be found in the section to the playlist in this manual . &quot;
&quot; there is a selection box under the search filter , with which help you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection . you can also choose your entire collection , starting from the last 24 hours to one year . &quot;

&quot; the playlist browser makes it easy to handle many play@@ lists . among other things , it also includes smart play@@ lists . &quot;
the lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart play@@ lists . these use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played .
&quot; even created smart play@@ lists are possible . click Intelligent Play@@ list to open the dialog to create a new smart playlist , where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist . &quot;
&quot; the sub@@ window Media Player is used for connection of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; using your portable media player ( such as iPod ) . to use for example your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod , it must be in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod to Interpre@@ t again in the upper list view of the Media Player browser . &quot;
&quot; to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and let them fall on the list interpreter . when finished , click App@@ ly . thus , the pieces will be uploaded to your iPod . when the transmission is completed , exit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and solve the drive connection for your iPod . &quot;
&quot; under the toolbar , there is a search area that you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden that do not meet your search criteria . &quot;
&quot; when you enter tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ c@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z and press Enter , you can access music from there in the Musi@@ c@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z file . now you can drag and drop music from there to the playlist . &quot;

&quot; when you enter keywords separated by spaces , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries containing all search terms . for example , if you enter one two , the search will find all entries containing one , two and three . &quot;
&quot; for example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found that contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for entries that contain spaces , then en@@ close the search term with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will search for entries that contain Mike Old@@ field , but not for entries like Mike J. Old@@ field . &quot;
&quot; for example , review : &gt; 50@@ . This searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for a piece that doesn &apos;t contain a certain search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something looks for pieces that do not contain something . &quot;
you can combine these syntax variants at will . for example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 comment : bad . this searches for all the pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field or have a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment bath .
&quot; you can set the sequence of entries by holding the C@@ trl key down , and then with the right mouse button in the desired order on the entries . the entries will then receive a mark with a number . the number is the order in which the pieces are played . &quot;
&quot; the playlist of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left side , you can find the Add button that you can add to the play@@ lists . &quot;

e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically play all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the associated sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on one entry opens the project .
&quot; if the project has already been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name . &quot;
saves the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save As is displayed with which you can select folder and fil@@ en@@ ame for the project file .
saves all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call for each individual project file save .
&quot; if a project has been changed and has not yet been saved , asks &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what is to happen . you can then disc@@ ard between saving and changes , and you can also cancel the project and keep the project open . &quot;
&quot; includes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for each un@@ saved project what to do with it , just as if you had called for each project file C@@ lose . &quot;
&quot; includes all opened projects and finished &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each un@@ saved project , you will be asked what to do with it as if you had called file C@@ lose . &quot;
&quot; when you call this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialogue . this has the same effect as if you drag the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files appear in the base folder of the CD . &quot;
&quot; this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button Br@@ ennen , der &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to burn the medium . the burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data . &quot;
&quot; opens the properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described by the What is the ? -@@ remedy ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . &quot;
&quot; this entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from previous session into the current project . this is useful if you are not using files for a multi @-@ session CD . it is intended for you rather than help , so that you can view the files and folders already present on the medium . &quot;
&quot; this entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; , to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . &quot;
&quot; this also allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can only create an image of a CD , which you can burn at some point later . you should also prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; this also allows the copying of a DVD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can also only create an image of a DVD that you can burn at some point later . besides , converting / c@@ ashing a DVD with the help of copying dialog is not yet supported , so the target medium must be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in its original form . &quot;
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete the entire contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
&quot; open the dialog to format a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , making the content completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the writing mod@@ i over@@ writing and incre@@ mental . &quot;
&quot; the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
&quot; burn a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . &quot;
&quot; this dialog window usually appears after reading a DVD in the table of content , but can also be used single @-@ standing . it contains information about the used video , encoding settings , and even possibilities for changing the size and cutting black edges . &quot;
&quot; this information is displayed in the content view and contains properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . if an entry is checked , the toolbar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; if this is checked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; if the table view is enabled , its content is displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locks and unlock the drive or ej@@ ecting the medium . &quot;
&quot; the content view allows you to select and drag files to the project view . the content view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs , if a drive was selected with an appropriate CD / DVD in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; the head strip is a narrow section , which is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the head@@ line does not have any real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views . &quot;
&quot; this will open a dialog window to change the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after having selected one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key assignment below . &quot;
&quot; this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . with this you can set the correct permissions for burning CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrator rights are required , so you must enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when starting the wizard . &quot;
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work immediately . this dialog is meant to person@@ alize and fine tune the program .
&quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications , also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P interface . using this interface , parts of functionality can be controlled , for example , via a shell script . &quot;
&quot; to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the command line d@@ co@@ p , or the somewhat more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functions , so your taste and style of your task is decisive , which of the included programs will give you the default . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter , we assume that you use the command line d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you must make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b is started . then enter something like the following in the console : &quot;
&quot; besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that all have in common , support &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts described below . &quot;
&quot; the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b provides functions such as copy@@ CD , format@@ DVD and other functions for generating new projects . &quot;
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) void release D@@ v@@ d ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
&quot; as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can create a project using the # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project . using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface . &quot;
K@@ 3@@ b features the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface listed above and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface which can only be used for data projects ( CD and DVD ) :

&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; select for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it you can easily select audio CD ; s are read out and stored in MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . also other formats are possible , depending on enco@@ der which is installed on the computer . &quot;
&quot; now l@@ ame for MP3 , og@@ l@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs and FLA@@ C ( los@@ s@@ less compression ) is supported by default ( these enco@@ der packages still need to be installed from the Linux distribution ) . further enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) . &quot;
first the titles of the CD ; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
&quot; in a second step , these WAV files ( usually one per title ) are compressed to the mp3 or O@@ GG format or in other formats as the los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C . &quot;
&quot; for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre@@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ ob@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders must be installed . however , all of these programs are usually not necessary to compile something themselves . however , only the enco@@ der packages must be installed , which are needed . if for example FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is also not necessary . &quot;
&quot; which encoding / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ ver gives a small introduction about enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for reading the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to handle any copy protection . in any case , &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; even do not avoid the mechanisms of copy protection . &quot;
&quot; while setting up only once ( the setup dialog can be called up to a suitable configuration ) , the daily use to read a &amp; CD will be explained later . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the lean approach of the user interface , which you often stum@@ ble across at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; convert to many formats - depending on which enco@@ der programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; can &amp; CD ; retrieve information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or can work completely without a network , whereby everything is manually entered . &quot;
&quot; this is just a short list of the main window commands . on the page step by step example , you will find more information about how this program is used , as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tab@@ s for configur@@ ing the program . &quot;
&quot; start the CD@@ DB request of the CD @-@ data according to the setup of the request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . ) &quot;
starts reading and - if an enco@@ der is configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup catalog - the encoding .
&quot; open a sub@@ menu with a list of available enco@@ ders , so that the selection can be read with another enco@@ der than the default . it is important to note that before the enco@@ der has been configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup dialog . &quot;
opens the file manager so that an already loaded file is selected to en@@ code instead of a full &amp; CD ; read and code .
&quot; open the Setup dialog to configure the type of messages ( such as protocols , pic@@ s ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; finished ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the main setup dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different flash@@ cards ( like enco@@ der , to set up the enco@@ der ) . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ der and compression ratios and helps you choose the right enco@@ der . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is to be lost , a los@@ s@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C , there are others like &quot; shor@@ ten &quot; or &quot; monkey &quot; that may be available for this distribution . &quot;
&quot; among the audio formats that lose information by data compression according to their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG might have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 kb@@ ps ) , but the differences are less important since both enco@@ ders produce very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos; not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is nevertheless supplied with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license questions &quot;
&quot; + High to very high sound quality ( high bit rates ) , but slightly lower quality compared to O@@ GG in lower bit@@ rates . &quot;
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG play devices is present .
&quot; MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special auto stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices usually support only the MP3 format . &quot;
a short list of audio quality parameters and resulting compression ratios for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually provide acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has already quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 kb@@ ps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 kb@@ ps for complex music pieces and less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 kb@@ ps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . requires always 256 kb@@ ps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 kb@@ ps C@@ BR joint stereo , compression rate about 11 128 kb@@ ps for all songs of a title . good Gen@@ u@@ g for music of young people , portable devices and auto@@ cla@@ ys . but not good enough for better hi @-@ fi stereo systems . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ kb@@ ps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want the highest quality regardless of file size , then select this setting . &quot;
the &amp; CD ; information that is manually entered or fet@@ ched by the program automatically from the fre@@ ed@@ b over the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / use it with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the coding program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
&quot; in connection with coding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the enco@@ der and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example , to add the CD ; titles to the keywords ( English : tag ) when MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t@@ t of l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; the result looks like : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button of a button in the wizard ) :
&quot; this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read / enter the audio CDs , so that all others can download this information instead of entering the computer . it &apos;s important to note that only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ les , artists , names of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not by the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I ( note of the translator ) am not attorney . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; information published publicly on the CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be har@@ med . all information can be obtained anyway with a bum@@ per through a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is active to select a check box ( sending an address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b can be used with another ( counter@@ f@@ eit ) address as the one in the system . in this type of configuration , it appears , the e @-@ mail address will not be used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( This can only know the programmer who has checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server is to be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between computers . &quot;
&quot; a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information while reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database . &quot;
which read @-@ out program is used to save songs from CD &amp; CD ; to save to WAV files on my computer ?
&quot; there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; if you want to know more about it , look in the source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD . note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; for saving the read WAV files , the enco@@ der and thus the desired file format can be selected . when opening , pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) can be added on the tab to set up the enco@@ der . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab itself . &quot;
the enco@@ der package must be installed from the Linux distribution in question before the enco@@ der can be used . this is also required for pre@@ defined enco@@ ders . more information about co@@ dec are in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ ver .
&quot; after installing a enco@@ der , more information about its switches can be obtained by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . &quot;
&quot; this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the write and reading rights on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed . &quot;
check that you do not want to read a copy protected audio CD ; check out the cover of the CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with one step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give you tips on how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; cd . we &apos;ll use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 kb@@ ps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V@@ 1 keywords ( tags ) . &quot;
&quot; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame have to be installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found for example with a search engine , as it is not considered to be completely free software . &quot;
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permission ( eg ; by trying to copy something into it ) .
&quot; the first section deals with basic set @-@ up of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , something that is probably done only once and &quot;
&quot; the second section describes the procedure for reading a CD ; , which needs to be repeated for each CD . &quot;
&quot; here we determine the enco@@ der to use for compression of music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 kb@@ ps ) . it determines where the files are stored and which structure is used . since we are lazy , we share the program to download the fre@@ ed@@ b to download the CD ; data from the Internet . &quot;
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change it every time you read a CD ; change once the right settings are found . &quot;
the device name is handed over to the read @-@ out program so that it can read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces .
&quot; often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device drawings for the CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
&quot; the card map General settings . there is not much to do here . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything is left / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot . &quot;
&quot; only in case of incomplete information , please select , so that you will be informed when information about generating keywords ( tags ) is missing . &quot;
the card card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and leave the &amp; CD ; data automatically downloaded via the Internet by a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the computer must be connected to the fre@@ ed@@ b server while reading the &amp; CD .
&quot; the second selection box is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry is found and starts immediately the reading of the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk if you later are unhappy with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , they can easily be changed . the directory or file name is changed with kon@@ quer@@ or &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example , please keep in mind : if you want to enter everything manually , de@@ activate the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . you can use fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if you want to download the database . however , if you use fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two choices must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following card card . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the CD ; information from the fre@@ ed@@ b server via the Internet . how does the system know what data the CD should get ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . set everything as shown in the screen@@ shot . &quot;
&quot; mode : we have not downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org page and look for a mirror server near you . on this path , the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work as a first attempt . &quot;
&quot; both function as equivalent to the server , since many fire@@ walls boot the 88@@ 80 protocol by default , there might be more luck with the 80 , since the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we don &apos;t want to send a &amp; CD ; send data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activate the first check box should suff@@ ice . &quot;
just take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
&quot; sorry , there is a reason why more than one at the same time with only an existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author doesn &apos;t know , so just try it yourself . &quot;
CD ; e@@ ject after reading the last piece : cross this to the CD ; disc@@ ard at the end of the process .
&quot; user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must be given the path / folder where the WAV files are stored . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . &quot;
&quot; enter everything as it is on the screen@@ shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something has to be fl@@ atten@@ ed to the right to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is about 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption . &quot;
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; to limit the generation of tags to version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags can also be deleted if necessary . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the complete path ) .
put the rest as shown in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside this example :
&quot; number of simultaneously enco@@ ded wa@@ v files : with a dual core or quad@@ ru@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine , it can be attempted to en@@ code more than one WAV file at the same time . &quot;
&quot; this is it , we just have the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; finished . this configuration is used as standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have wis@@ ely chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change it again . &quot;
&quot; the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , was described and set up in the previous section . first , a connection to the Internet is built , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each read @-@ out &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; since we use a &amp; CD , which is not yet included in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a little different from those for a CD ; with success from fre@@ ed@@ b logged data . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; manually enter data instead of retri@@ eving them from the Internet . comments will point to the differences . &quot;
don &apos;t try the &amp; CD ; this example can be found . it &apos;s a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this is not done yet , the &amp; CD must now be inserted into the drive defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , just like in the screen@@ shot . this only when the &amp; CD ; as audio CD ; can be identified and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; if this is not done , look for the help section in the section Ques@@ tions and Ans@@ wers , or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the CD was successfully picked up by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all tracks of the pieces are already filled and the name of the artist and the album are shown . &quot;
&quot; in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; gives , a window appears , and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; if you have not selected the check box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by selecting the first button in the toolbar . if you do not have a local database , but fetch the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet . &quot;
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
&quot; enter the data for your CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; refresh title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the artist no longer needs to be entered in the input field &apos; Current titles &apos; , unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece . &quot;
&quot; the lower comment field can be used for individual comment@@ aries per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments that are common for all songs of the CD . &quot;
&quot; attention : after the retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b , the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor ( e.g. whether all words start with capital letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the comment field . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; maximum allowed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tag information of the generated files later with tag editor at any time . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see Help with the enco@@ der to get more information .
&quot; simply select an entry that obviously corresponds to the style of the cut @-@ out CD . in this example , this is not important since we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; data anyway . for more information go to the Internet site of fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ or@@ g. and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are to be found under Rock . &quot;
&quot; after choosing &apos; OK &apos; , you get back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece . &quot;
&quot; the CD editor window appears again and you &apos;ll see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data , which we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . &quot;
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the CD ;
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the toolbar . note that the artist and the album are displayed above the play list .
&quot; note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . a simple click on the row switches the selection of the piece to or off . make sure all pieces are selected , or press the All pieces button at the bottom of the screen to choose all pieces at once . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the button select the selection process started , this window will appear for confirmation . click OK and then we &apos;ll take a look at the window with the orders and follow what runs out . &quot;
&quot; click on the tab orders to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly below the buttons of the toolbar . &quot;
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is read on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the lower left corner of the window in the status line .
you will see this error if you are trying to work with a co@@ dec you haven &apos;t installed yet . pieces that have not been successfully coded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
&quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and destination folder are not what we entered here in the example . have you checked if you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and destination folders ? ; - ) &quot;
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece .
&quot; the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . this means reading and coding in parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
&quot; the author of the program has no configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding . in case of performance @-@ weak machines , the result is unclear . &quot;
&quot; now the last title is read out , while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is displayed in the queue of the enco@@ der . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . res@@ p . 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the enco@@ der of your choice . &quot;
&quot; most distri@@ butions include a pre @-@ compiled package , since &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; part of an important package . if you read this , you probably have already done it ... &quot;
this section is directed to persons compiled by source files and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
&quot; if you are looking for help like the program can be adjusted to your needs once it is running , then the following is right for you : &quot;
a program that calls many different programs has many variations in settings . it is best to read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it displays screen@@ shots of the different card cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
&quot; Hello , still am reading ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked on the first @-@ time start of the program , without any clu@@ e as it should continue from this empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD in the drive ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ? &quot;
what is it about ? who reads this has probably already started the program . it should look something like this :
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately no email . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and if you want to read this , he has left this section and therefore agrees with this suggestion . &quot;
&quot; strange if you managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these information , but ... &quot;

&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and press the Play button in the toolbar , select the entry from the menu item or press the space bar . &quot;
&quot; please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece will automatically start as soon as you click on the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( for several pieces , they will be added to a collection and then played one after the other . ) &quot;
&quot; once you play a piece , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive back and forth with the regulator . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows to the left and right of the tempo display and thus change the playing speed . to get back the original tempo , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar like a pressure on the button break or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu , thus interrup@@ ts playback . press the space bar while no piece is played , starts and k@@ mid ; playback . &quot;
&quot; lyrics can be stored on two types in a piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics and others both . some pieces have no text : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically retri@@ eved , which uses a song so that you do not have to manually set automatic text selection . however , you still have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other type . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set up an event type , select the text events or song events from the Settings menu . the same function also has the keys 1 and 2 . &quot;
&quot; a collection is a list of MIDI files that you can summ@@ ari@@ ze , which will be played back in series . in this section you will find how to use collections efficiently . &quot;
&quot; to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find it in the menu collection under the point Organ@@ izing .... Click there on New and enter the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on Copy and then speci@@ fying the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs at the beginning as the original ones .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can set the only ones in the collection manager . &quot;
the temporary collection contains all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
&quot; when you exit the application , this collection will not be saved . remember , if you add many pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there , you can add a song with the Add button . again , the file dialog appears , with which help you can select the desired song . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on the automatic addition to the collection .
&quot; when automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Drag &amp; Drop ) . &quot;
&quot; if automatic add to the collection is not enabled , when opening a piece the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied . this collection will then be added to the still opened pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the series from the sub@@ menu of the collection order of the menu collections , the songs are played in the order , as they have been added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; when you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order is re@@ defined . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ a@@ oke text . &quot;
&quot; to skip a song , select the next song button , select next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right . &quot;
&quot; to reverse a song back , select the button Previous piece , the entry Previous piece from the menu item or press the arrow on the left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to be deleted and click the Del@@ ete button . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not play a role since it is not saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers who are not General MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map transl@@ ates general MIDI events into events that the synthes@@ izer understands . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map that transforms all occur@@ ren@@ ces of the Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the Change patch to Tru@@ mp@@ et type and thus always lets you sound a trumpet if originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you only have a sound card , you don &apos;t need MIDI map because all sound cards are GM @-@ compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI maps . so you have to edit the appropriate file from hand ( with your favorite editor ) . &quot;
a MIDI map is a text file that stores all required implement@@ ations for playing a piece .
&quot; each section may appear only once , except for the key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . however , the requirement for this is that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) . &quot;
Def@@ ine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; name of key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; An additional key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
see that Def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as email so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can offer for devices that are not General MIDI compatible .
this section specifies how the patches of General MIDI are displayed to your specific keyboard . general use looks like this :
&quot; please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to show all tones that this instrument needs to put on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard does not support a gun shooting ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with clay 60 ) which sounds similar to a gun . &quot;
&quot; so if now a MIDI file should play a note with Patch 127 ( gun shooting ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tune 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here is the term drum patch of the patch , where each sound is a different perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ing instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ al , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one where the sound means the pitch of the same drum ( as some key@@ boards have ) . &quot;
the key@@ map section is used to indicate how sounds are displayed on a particular channel or instrument .
&quot; as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the order of the lines is very important , as well their presence . so you have to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define several key maps for each channel and each instrument . you only have to use different names in the first row .
key@@ maps are mainly used to map tones on the perc@@ ussions channel . see for example the included keyboard maps .
&quot; this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to exchange the first and second channel , simply do it in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards , which have the percussion on a particular channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; if you use the key@@ map option , the key@@ map is used with the name Name for this channel . of course , if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored that try to change the patch on that channel . in this case , patch x is always used . &quot;
&quot; for example , the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful to always use the perc@@ ussions patch on the percussion channel . &quot;
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates in which ratio pitch @-@ ben@@ der events are multiplied . if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value n , it is converted with the n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then re@@ directed . the value 40@@ 96 is used to make no dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as in the map file . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed because GM shows that a keyboard , which receives a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value 40@@ 96 , should play a sound higher . unfortunately , some key@@ boards try to play two notes up to one oc@@ tave . to find the correct value on your keyboard , you have to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog . you will find this in the menu under Settings , point MIDI Settings &quot;
the channel view is a window with a whole set of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you see which sounds are being played .
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel . for each channel , there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
the channel view has ( up to now ) two different views to display the played sounds . view the view in the Settings menu under the View Channel view : settings
&quot; the speed LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the higher the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tempo of a song . so , for example , if you find a song too fast to follow the lyrics , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows left and right of the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; . this can lead the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way . &quot;
&quot; well , I can &apos;t force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while a mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you get a similar sound quality . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid has been compiled without AW@@ E support . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example by k@@ mid ; &apos;s home ) &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files separately . &quot;
&quot; agree , therefore support &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . &quot;
&quot; before , enable automatic addition to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
you can press the arrow button on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down playback . to restore the default tempo you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
&quot; I have a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a kar@@ a@@ oke file ) or attached ( if I play a kar@@ a@@ oke file ) , I need to switch to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window and drag the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; if you just want to quickly listen to a file without adding it to a collection , switch automatic addition to the collection , and the new one ; file will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ M. and C.@@ mid@@ . first you just want to play the first file . so , set the setting automatic addition to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file . &quot;
then decide to play B.@@ M. and C.@@ mid and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
&quot; these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , it anim@@ ates me to program on &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; Mal@@ aga . I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; I do not have much spare time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take a bit of time as hob@@ bies . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kara@@ oke files if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an e @-@ mail : lar@@ pink @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ ler@@ r @ ar@@ rac@@ is@@ .@@ es &quot;
&quot; if you send me a postcard from your home or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ a@@ oke file from a local group . if you send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will contact with friends von &amp; k@@ mid ; but before you send me a MIDI file , you should contact me as I may already have the file . &quot;
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and managed by no one for it . I would like to emphasize that I only want to program more because / when I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or e @-@ mails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the defect that the pitch was too high for AW@@ E cards .
&quot; thanks to Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing the G@@ US support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia for testing the AW@@ E support , H@@ as Pet@@ ter Bi@@ ek@@ er , Marc Di@@ ef@@ en@@ bruch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Magn@@ us Pep@@ a , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ thei@@ der , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , error message or just a suppor@@ tive e @-@ mail . &quot;
and of course my thanks to all these excellent musicians on the net who give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ a@@ oke files .
&quot; in addition to this , &amp; k@@ mid can be found on his homepage , which is located under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rac@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ pink / k@@ mi@@ d.@@ html . on the homepage you can follow the development , search information and view images . you will also find links to pages with other kar@@ a@@ oke songs , &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer , because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use a FM radio or an AW@@ E card . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you must compile &amp; k@@ mid ; compile with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you have a sound card , except that you can of course hear no music . &quot;
&quot; if problems occur , contact one of the e @-@ mail mailing lists or send an error message directly to me . &quot;
&quot; the program is used to play video files of formats supported by M@@ Player or Phon@@ on , as well as for playback of DVD , V@@ CD s or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this machine .
&quot; for additional help , please check the K@@ DE website on new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User mailing list . &quot;
&quot; the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is a window with the playlist . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to save the preferred links under the book@@ marks menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category permanent playlist . &quot;
&quot; of course you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy of hierarch@@ ies . if you are looking for an entry , its group and all its sub@@ groups are copied to the current category and playback begins with the cli@@ cked entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; up @-@ to @-@ date piece &apos; , TV and permanent playlist can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do that if &amp; KM@@ Player , but also by using it . simply click on a name of a category , then select from the menu View and next edit mode . by clicking a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this part will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , you must select the playlist from the menu and select either the Edit mode , or select another category . &quot;
all changes will be lost when the processor mode is left or another group is selected without the playlist .
&quot; due to the convenience of the author of &amp; KM@@ Player , some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files .. &quot;
the animation during starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c and changing &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ iger option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present it can be inserted easily .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; KM@@ Player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation during startup does not need to be short , it is automatically ended by opening another source . this would be annoying in the end animation , so the user can finish the application a second time . &quot;
a simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ lage ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ lage ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ lage ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ lage ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ lage ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ lage ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ lage ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ lage ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ lage ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ lage ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ lage ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ lage ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ lage ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ lage ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ lage ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ lage ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ lage ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ lage ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ lage ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ lage ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ lage ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ lage ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ lage ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ lage ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ lage ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ lage ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ lage ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ lage ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ lage ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ lage ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ lage ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ lage ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ lage ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ lage ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ lage ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ lage ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ lage ; &amp; lt ;
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; . here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the &apos; Con@@ sole &apos; button in the toolbar of KM@@ Player . here you can see the output of mp@@ layer .
&quot; there is no tab for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; all needs to be configured by manual editing of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c , just like setting up the back@@ end per mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example of how to play a &apos; flash &apos; with the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module : &quot;
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; KM@@ Player ; it can even include the special embed video embed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
&quot; to play &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; KM@@ Player ; module as service provider for the mim@@ e type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the setup dialog file assignments of K@@ DE must be specified . &quot;
&quot; the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; KM@@ Player ; is to be used in a console application and search for error messages related to loading the browser module library . if there are no errors , the back@@ end output is within &amp; KM@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; so that a given back@@ end is always taken for a certain mim@@ e type ( of course only if this is also determined ) , this must be done by manual modification of the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c file . for example , Phon@@ on will play all og@@ g files : &quot;
&quot; &amp; KM@@ Player ; can play from TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before watching TV , you need to configure the device to use and the TV channels . to do this , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually . &quot;
&quot; to configure the V@@ DR ( Video Data recorder ) settings in the KM@@ Player , the dialog in the Settings - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port is to be used . there should be identified ports from which one is selected . the encoding to be used must be found ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DV@@ B in it . &quot;
&quot; because the V@@ DR support of KM@@ Player can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this type of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension must be functional for the X server . for this reason , the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must include the following in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) &quot;
&quot; at the time of the creation of this documentation are dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ source , pi@@ pes@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . &quot;
there are hints how to make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom can be used as a user root after inser@@ ting the device . it is absolutely certain that / dev / c@@ drom is pointing to the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;
&quot; x@@ ine starts only slowly , why must each time my CPU be checked for its performance ? &quot;
&quot; note : the answer is over@@ hau@@ . k@@ x@@ in@@ ep@@ layer automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU . &quot;

to learn more about posters ; and to learn about its possibilities the manual can be consul@@ ted to K@@ ate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start working there directly with reading the chapter working with the editor of posters ;
&quot; for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the correct pron@@ unciation : La@@ y @-@ TECH . it is difficult to use , but a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it deri@@ ves from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port . &quot;
&quot; if there is only a good view to &amp; lat@@ ex ; given , it is not the ultimate book to do this . to be able to control properly , good books should be used e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Pre@@ par@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 . &quot;
&quot; same as other mark@@ up languages includes &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction with which the general characteristics such as paper format , page number@@ ing and text sizes are specified as well as a body with the text . the introduction contains at least the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ begin { document } . &quot;
the quick @-@ entry Wiz@@ ard of &amp; Ki@@ le ; is an important function for quick creation of a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the selection of the wizard ( menu ) offers some options for creating the document . you can also make some of the document related settings .
&quot; document classes : this defines the type of document to be created : articles ( items ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; letter &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ book &#93; , Proj@@ ector &#91; Be@@ amer &#93; , Films &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user @-@ defined . &quot;
&quot; encoding : this sets the character encoding . modern systems are increasingly using UT@@ F @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best , UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for the correct processing of the &amp; lat@@ ex ; documents ) . &quot;
&quot; this list includes the most commonly used packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for integration , they only have to be selected in the check box . &quot;
&quot; article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . &quot;
new users do not have to worry about it . it is just a short description of the functions and further information about this will be given in the section .
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers - as well as other source code editors - high@@ lighting the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . by &amp; Ki@@ le ; it is very likely that any mathematical environment is not closed . &quot;
&quot; with the automatic completion of the environment , by entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) by &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically creates a blank line ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be set in the box settings box ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled . &quot;
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allows sub@@ division of the document to the following elements ( part is the highest and sub@@ paragraph the bottom element ) :
&quot; in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by clicking on the respective item . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; as soon as a DVI file is created , click &amp; box ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; viewer to the corresponding line in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code . &quot;
&quot; a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is next to PDF the commercial output file of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing DVI ; files for different systems and devices . &quot;
&quot; when using the button search , the elements of the DVI ; file are connected to the editor and as soon as an element is cli@@ cked in the DVI ; file , the exact opposite of it . as soon as a section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code was cli@@ cked , the corresponding location is spra@@ yed in the DVI ; viewer . &quot;
&quot; master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , working with others is simplified .@@ tex files are simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set over project project settings . &quot;
quick installation : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( unless there are any errors in the source code ) .
&quot; surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; file is on &quot; &quot; nic@@ .@@ &quot; &quot; and there is no call from &amp; Ok@@ ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after quick installation . &quot;
&quot; when viewing the Edit toolbar , the three large selection fields should be noticed . the selection boxes have been developed for quick insertion of the document into parts , chapters , sections ... The ver@@ itable &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands for sub@@ division are : &quot;
&quot; the Other is for inser@@ ting articles such as keywords , foot@@ notes or references . the available options are : &quot;
&quot; description : with this command , a name for a section , an image or other element is created . &quot;
reference : used for reference to a specified term ( choice of a selection box possible ) .
the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; files may be written by hand .
&quot; the last drop @-@ down box named &quot; &quot; Gra@@ y &quot; &quot; is used for defining the font size . the font sizes can be specified for the main text , the notes , etc . the following font sizes are available : &quot;
&quot; when calling &amp; box , two choices are available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings . 2 . the document can be written from the bottom to the hand . &quot;
&quot; the brackets after the command \ \ DVI class include the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; defines the font size . if the font size is not fixed at the beginning , this can also occur later in the text . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the above source code example has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is to use the construction or button quick construction . &quot;
the source code must be saved before comp@@ iling .
&quot; if the document compilation fails , it should be searched for errors in logging . when using quick construction , it should be started . if this is not the case , the logging should also be taken into account . &quot;
&quot; an environment ( English environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font has been created and only a few columns should have another font . &quot;
the changes are considered merely within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no restriction ( number ) for changes within an environment .
&quot; there are many possibilities to increase the read@@ ability and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , certain fonts , grease , cur@@ sive pressure , sub@@ missions , etc . these commands end either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the itali@@ c print and is as long as it is closed with a \ \ end { isti@@ h } or another environment . a single word in one sentence can be displayed recur@@ sively with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . the quote begins with \ \ begin { quote } and ends with \ \ end { quote } .
&quot; after the background for writing the source code with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; mark@@ up language was presented , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for the creation of a document in &amp; Ki@@ le is now followed . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the wizard has entered a bit of text , a few adjustments to the better read@@ ability of the document should be performed . to do this , min@@ d. a quote , a few passages in the fat and ital@@ ics and a poem can be used to see the differences of these commands . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , Editor View or C@@ trl E can be returned to the editor again ( for internal viewer ) . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the DVI file has been created , the document can be printed or converted into a Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . just try out and have fun . &quot;
&quot; DVI ; is an independent file format ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ ort ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi output such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screens . &quot;
&quot; for printing a &amp; DVI ; file the same steps as needed for creating the document are necessary ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , then the document can be printed by file printing ( if the printer is set correctly ) . &quot;
&quot; the toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI ; file to other formats . as soon as the DVI file was created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code , the conversion can begin using the buttons in the toolbar . &quot;
the forward search allows direct jump from the editor to the associated position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; bin@@ aries . to do this only modern must be set up under Settings box ... Tools must be fully balanced .
&quot; to execute the preferred search , the mouse cursor must be positioned in a line of the source code and then cli@@ cked on forward search . the jump to the corresponding location in the DVI is then eff@@ ected . &quot;
&quot; with this function in &amp; oc@@ ular , with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; document by &amp; Ki@@ le ; opened and bound to the corresponding line . to do this , &amp; Ki@@ le ; in &amp; Ok@@ ey@@ epi@@ ece ; set as text editor ( setting up ey@@ epi@@ ece ... Editor ) &quot;
&quot; if there is no error when using the &amp; DVI interface , an error may occur . if there is an error , this will be displayed in the log file or in the message window . &quot;
&quot; the log file informs the source of errors in the source code . in the editor , you can use Previous La@@ Te@@ X errors and N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ ster La@@ Te@@ X errors for jumps between the errors . to view the fla@@ wed line , click on the error in logging and &amp; Ki@@ le ; navig@@ ates to the faulty line . &quot;
&quot; once cli@@ cked on the respective button in the toolbar , a window will appear to select the template to be used for the document . the default options are : &quot;
&quot; when selecting a blank document , a document can be re@@ written from scratch or the wizard will be used to quickly create a new document . further information on this can be found in the section . &quot;
&quot; user of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file must be opened or created a new file . &amp; Ki@@ le ; can create a new template by creating an existing document and selecting file template from document ... &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document from a template using File New , some strings may be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set in settings box ... Settings can be set . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables : &quot;
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is sub@@ stituted by entering the document class . typically it is used as follows : \ \ DVI class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { item } .
&quot; the simplest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps must be executed : &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document , you can then select your own template instead of the default . &quot;
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files will be created . a simple way to create a template should be searched for on the Internet and the steps described below .
&amp; box ; used as internal editor . &amp; kate ; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and producing many different types of text files ( including &amp; blo@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for posters ; can be made in the menu directly out of &amp; box ; out .
to learn more about the posters ; and to learn its features the manual should be consul@@ ted to K@@ ate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start working there directly with reading the chapter working with the editor of posters ;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a very convenient &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference , which can be inv@@ oked on the La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a detailed description of nearly all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use and its syntax . &quot;
double @-@ click with but@@ ton@@ ed C@@ trl key to select the &amp; tex ; word means that the \ \ par \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; when dra@@ gging the text with a left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . &quot;
&quot; when using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key , parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to browse and emphasize different types of source texts , for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by another color . &quot;
&quot; many assistants can enter additional boun@@ ce marks . this is an own type of book@@ marks within the text . the Men@@ alu@@ Ã ¤ ge Edi@@ ting Mark@@ s or the corresponding key boxes allow the jump to the next or last jump mark , so that it is automatically deleted when entering a character . &quot;
&quot; editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like &amp; Ki@@ le ; . although &amp; kate , it has been added in &amp; Ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code are added . &quot;
&quot; contains a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing a blank line on both sides ) . with a paragraph , it is not a text with continuous lines ( as in other text editors ) . this extended meaning then closes tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . &quot;
&quot; select the word under the current cursor position . this selection also has an extended meaning , as this command also has an extended meaning ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end . &quot;
&quot; to delete a part of the document , of course , this can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; box ; provides the key C@@ trl + K with which the whole line is removed . &quot;
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; box ; is contained in the description to edit select paragraph .
it has already been made clear that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore &amp; Ki@@ le ; for further commands under Edit environment for a more easy work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
&quot; with this command , jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment . &quot;
with this command you jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to lock the environment .
&quot; if the cursor is in front of or within the \ \ begin { environment } command , skip to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering a number of ne@@ sted environment commands , the overview can quickly be lost . this command will close the recently opened environment so that the ne@@ sted environment structure will not be destroyed . &quot;
&amp; Ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups which are determined by par@@ enth@@ eses { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are some important commands that correspond to those from the Edit environment .
this command is used to jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) .
with this command you jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the welded clasp .
&quot; if the cursor is in front of or behind the braces of a &amp; tex ; group # , skip to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; in the input of many ne@@ sted welded brackets , quickly the overview should be lost . this command will close the recently opened group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the tex ; groups is not destroyed . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the sign &quot; used for two simple reference marks . also for the end of the application , the sign &quot; is used . &quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; knows this case and adds two connecting notes for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one . &quot;
this automatic insertion of the double quotes can be set up under Settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
&quot; ad @-@ specific settings can also be used ( e.g. n@@ au@@ German or French ) , so that German or French suits can be used . there are also many other languages available . &quot;
&quot; when shift shift ; enter key &amp; box ; an intelligent line break . if the current position within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) is located , &amp; Ki@@ le ; not only a line break but also the command \ \ item . &quot;
&quot; close a table environment , close &amp; drop ; the current line with \ \ \ \ will start with an adjoining new@@ line . &quot;
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or user @-@ defined environments .
&quot; some users want to arrange the columns in tables -@@ surroundings and all the E@@ t @-@ characters ( amp ; ) among each other . &amp; Ki@@ le ; tries to achieve this . in the case of Shift ; Alt ; search &amp; Ki@@ le ; after the next tab , add to the column position of the current tab . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; kate ; already a good source code completion , it was added in &amp; Ki@@ le ; for special commands ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) , three different modes are implemented for automatic completion . all of these modes can be configured for different modes of operation under Settings ... &quot;
&quot; when starting a new environment using the command \ \ begin { Environment } , &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically added the command \ \ end { environment } following an empty line ( for text ) . &quot;
&quot; when pressing the back button , the last letter of the input will be removed and thus the complete list will be cleared . on the other hand , the list may also shrink by entering another letter . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions will be removed by selecting a command . alternatively , jumping stamps can be added , so that a simple jump to these positions can be added by means of the jump marks N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ st jump mark and the desired parameters can then be added . &quot;
&quot; under Settings box ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; Con@@ figur@@ able settings can be made to these lists . there can be several lists of lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands , as well as W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ b@@ Ã ¼ cher of the general language used . &quot;
&quot; command mode is not necessary for the complete destruction of environments . on the other hand , a few letters with \ \ begin will always have to be entered and a large list of environmental commands will result . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; Ki@@ le ; a special mode for complete destruction of environments . &quot;
&quot; when calling the full @-@ spac@@ ed environment or the Alt + Shift key , the command to change the environment is automatically added and it appears \ \ begin { . after that , the environmental damage can be continued in the simplest way and finished by pressing the input button . &quot;
&quot; once this is done , the environment will be automatically closed again . once the box detects that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command is added . &quot;
&quot; under Settings box ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; permanently , settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ List of full @-@ time mode for tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands . &quot;
&quot; Ki@@ le ; supports user @-@ defined lists of re@@ plac@@ ements that are immediately replaced by more strings . the lists can be set up under Settings box ... Ki@@ le can be fully set up . as an example of an exit list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , for example , is included in the L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X entry . &quot;
&quot; for example , if the letter L entered and the word processor mode has been added to the processing or the C@@ trl + Alt key , the character L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot;
great W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ b@@ Ã ¼ cher are not helpful for automatic completion . however it has been found that many offices are written more than once in a document .
&quot; this mode can be set up in the box settings box ... Ki@@ le can be canc@@ eled . here , also the threshold value can be set for display of complete damage . &quot;
&quot; the exec@@ utable files can be installed in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / ki@@ le / complete / mode / of the Per@@ s@@ Ã ¶ n@@ liche Home folder . mode stands for abbrevi@@ ation ( abbrevi@@ ation ) , Dic@@ tionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex . &quot;
&quot; the dialog graphics are designed to make graphics as easy as possible . to view the basics of graphics formats , the sections should be taken into account . &quot;
&quot; PS files are not as well known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for changes and re@@ arrangement of pages . if the PDF output is required , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools can be converted to a PDF file with ps@@ 2@@ pdf . &quot;
&quot; to be able to examine the results of the work , the source code needs to be compiled . all construction tools are grouped in batch mode in the Cre@@ compile , Gener@@ ate conversion and Gener@@ ate view . &quot;
&quot; for comp@@ iling the source code for viewer such as an ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the other conversion can be used by pressing alt ; 2 , using Alt ; 4 , the DVI ; file can be converted into a PS file and can be viewed by Alt ; 5 the PS file . &quot;
&quot; when using the fast @-@ build command , a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if no built @-@ in viewer is used , each time a new window will open . &quot;
a new project will be asked about the project New Project .... here will be asked for the following information for the project :
&quot; when selecting the fil@@ en@@ ame window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file . &quot;
the script function of &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows the execution of EC@@ MA@@ Script codes . the scripts can be managed on scripts in the vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet fully developed and can be added in other versions of &amp; Ki@@ le .
&quot; first , it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; Ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = box ) with the following methods has : &quot;
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a quite fla@@ wed system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different help to support users .
&quot; &amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ tual ; are supplied with many documents , including a documentation for the included packages and a further &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference . &quot;
&quot; this is not only a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather is a complete manual for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands contain and is therefore ideal for searching for a specific format@@ ting . since this is a very large document , it is divided into three important book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; due to the quantity of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ tual ; delivered , finding the right document is not always easy . as possible help &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ tual ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all documents and documents , and for a graphical surface area . &quot;
all documents are divided into categories and the biggest advantage is the search for package names or keywords . by &amp; Ki@@ le ; only the results are displayed .
double @-@ click with the mouse or the space bar opens the viewer for the document .
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a source code editor that can be used on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ de ; - and Unix @-@ like systems . &amp; Ki@@ le ; is also a part of the Fink project , whereby &amp; Ki@@ le ; also available on &amp; Mac , with installed OS @-@ X. &quot;
&quot; many thanks to those who asp@@ ire to continue the &amp; Ki@@ le ; project and sacrifice for many hours for the development of tools , which we all can use under observ@@ ance of the &amp; GNU ; license . &quot;

&quot; for random sign@@ atures , any signature from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig is read out . by many sign@@ atures with different quotes , styles and information , you can design your emails varied and unique . &quot;
&quot; for daily sign@@ atures , the same signature is read from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig . for each day use different sign@@ atures as with the random sign@@ atures create unique e @-@ mails . &quot;
&quot; to create a new signature , select C@@ trl ; N file New . this gives you an empty signature ; in the section Sig@@ natur@@ es . click the &amp; lt ; empty Sig@@ natur@@ es ; and add your new signature in the bottom section . &quot;
&quot; you can create as many sign@@ atures as you like . then you have a list of sign@@ atures for e @-@ mail programs like &amp; k@@ mail ; . whether you use e @-@ mails privately or professionally , there are always enough sign@@ atures . &quot;
&quot; to delete a signature , select it first and then remove in the File menu or click on the symbol with the red cross removing in the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; here you can select short commands for menu entries . to change a short command , select an action from the list . then click the user defined button on the right and enter the new short@@ cut by pressing the button or key combination . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; k@@ de ; 3.5 required . to attach sign@@ atures to your e @-@ mails , you need a program like &amp; k@@ mail ; or another program that can insert the signature text from the output of a command . &quot;
&quot; all the stack @-@ stack elements are listed here . the older the pile entry is , the lower its frame number . see the example below . &quot;

local and global variables are shown on a map in the X@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g In@@ spec@@ tor dialog . the following example shows X@@ S@@ LT source code where a global and a local variable is declared
&quot; by clicking a variable from the list , you get a summary information in the dialog below . if a variable is a particular expression , for example &quot;
&quot; if it contains , a new X@@ Path can be selected by entering a new value for the variable expression and clicking the button . &quot;
&quot; when clicking a variable entry in the list , the text poin@@ ter in the main window will be moved to the corresponding line of this file . &quot;
&quot; the version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . all these tools use Kom@@ mander as surface and lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as a base . the combination gives fast , efficient , complete and productive tools . &quot;
&quot; everyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows me and how outstanding it is . if we raise it a bit , we give it a graphical interface ! no more dependent on a terminal ; simply cli@@ cked and done the symbol for the XML processor ! &quot;
&quot; this application needs a inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is in the shared folder , then leave the current working folder . if not , then remove the selection of current working folders and specify the folder you want in the field of other folders . &quot;
&quot; output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files will be deleted each time , when mein@@ pro@@ c is started . &quot;
&quot; as already said , everyone who has worked on the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there is now a great graphical interface for it . &quot;
&quot; if the currently opened file is inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book , then simply leave the current working folder . if not , select current working folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is to be found . &quot;
&quot; if it comes to an issue on the screen , its file is faulty . please check the reported errors and try again . &quot;
&quot; the file to be checked is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then it &apos;s easy to hook up the current file . if not , delete the check box at current file and select the file to be checking with another file - file selection . &quot;
if you just want to know if the well @-@ formed file is well @-@ formed click the Well @-@ formed review selection .
&quot; for use of a &amp; DT@@ D ; specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( default ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and specify the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; file selection . both for the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema as well as for the Relax@@ NG verification is required in file selection . &quot;
&quot; yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , has also a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 library . &quot;
&quot; if the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus can be selected , then it &apos;s easy to select the current file . if not , remove the selected file and select the file to be processed using the other file choos@@ er . &quot;
specify the name of the file as the result should have been named . the file is usually stored in your home folder .
&quot; the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , have to do with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , even possibly little . thus , the plug @-@ in system is very powerful . you can benefit from the additional functionality immediately and do not have to wait until someone uses the desired in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . you can find more about it below . &quot;
&quot; to install a plug @-@ in or a K@@ Part , we start with the Edit menu . this will open the following dialog : &quot;
this dialog enables you to manage all included plu@@ gins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plu@@ gins without a location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often on one project several people work in a sort of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the specification of team members and they can be configured using Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and serves for unique identification .
&quot; a member can have several roles in the project , such as both team leaders and sub @-@ project leaders . &quot;
&quot; the user can choose from the list of team members who he is . this is done by selecting the team member from the list and pressing the button &quot; &quot; S@@ etze &quot; . &quot; the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears fat after which you are : text . &quot;
nick@@ names and the setting of your own identity are important in terms of news and comments . see for more information on comments .
&quot; in addition to an overview of their team , there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team : it can be an event for inform@@ ing the team leaders when something specific happens . see in for further information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . one example would be the recording of opening and closing of the project , so that later can be seen how much someone worked on it or sending a message when a file is included , or a script that enters a file into CVS as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; on the page Event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Settings dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
&quot; an email is sent to the address data selected in the recipient list . addressing can be a team or sub @-@ project leader . see , know how to set up such leaders . &quot;
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
&quot; to enter notes is simple . either the note entry can be selected from the editor context menu , or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword will be typ@@ ed in a comment section followed by comment text . &quot;
&quot; notes can be sent to a determin@@ able member of the team . in this case the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( R@@ ole ) , where nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the team member , should be given the appropriate area or sub@@ project names , as shown in the following examples below . &quot;
&quot; nick@@ names and roles names are in@@ sensitive , but spaces between brackets and brackets : make the note invalid . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages that is DT@@ D agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
&quot; the settings can be reached via the Settings menu . here only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in . &quot;
the settings can be set up using settings Qu@@ anta ... This dialog extends over some pages which will be treated one after another .
&quot; the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , regarding tags , including car completion , can be changed with this . entries are : &quot;
&quot; large / lower@@ case of tags : large / lower@@ case of automatically inserted tags . normal size / lower@@ case means , the tags are inserted as described in tag@@ ging XML files . &quot;
&quot; large / lower@@ case of attributes : large / lower@@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal size / lower@@ case meaning , the attributes are inserted as described in tag@@ ging XML files . &quot;
&quot; optional tags automatically include : if checked , for tags , for which the closing day is optional , this is immediately after &amp; gt ; inserted . &quot;
not include optional tags : as above for all other tags with the exception of simple tags .
&quot; automatically update the start and finish tag : if enabled , the corresponding closing tag will be changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic setting of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into the corresponding encoding during typing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for the detection of different types of files . the default settings can be restored using the default button .
&quot; standard character encoding : the encoding of newly created or otherwise than with file opening of opened files ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) , but this setting is executed by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D was not detected . however , this setting is executed by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; create a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , generated regularly backup copies so that during a power failure or crash when the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as storing the file . &quot;
&quot; the preview and documentation can be viewed either in the editor area or in your own view ( or the documentation in a box guide ) , making it possible to view the documentation , preview and source code at the same time . &quot;
reset the default window settings to the default when the user interface is confused by changing the M@@ DI modes and / or hanging from views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameter .
the warning message section provides the control of the possibility to disable the display of warnings by hooks of no more requests .
the location for the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; to change it . it can be set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchronization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source code view in shared mode .
&quot; here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , representing the illustration of the par@@ ser no@@ des in the document , can be set in detail . &quot;
&quot; in the mouse @-@ click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse button kno@@ bs . &quot;
&quot; in the section Stru@@ cture Tree Con@@ figuration you can set the visibility of no@@ des in the tree , the frequency of the tree while editing , and how deep when changing the structure tree is to be opened . empty knots are the empty fields in the text , while empty groups are those in which no item has been found in the current document . &quot;
&quot; abbrevi@@ ations are grouped into groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; this means there can be a valid group for PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ clause abbrevi@@ ation means something else than in a group valid for Jav@@ ascript . &quot;
&quot; plu@@ gins are K@@ Part @-@ applications from third party , which can be re@@ used by any part @-@ enabled application , the best known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be given : &quot;
address : the path to the plugin if it is not in a standard like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
&quot; input : this information is passed to the plug @-@ in at startup , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
load component in &quot; Read Only &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in refuses to load . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse loading if this option is not selected .
&quot; check the plugin : if this is enabled , then test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , if the entered information is correct . select the saving of the entry even if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , but it will be installed later . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , from version 3.3 , de@@ bu@@ gging has been completely re@@ developed . support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger has been set , as well as support for the DB@@ G de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger @-@ Plugin concept has been implemented that allows different implement@@ ations of plu@@ gins . &quot;
&quot; currently , only one plugin is available , the support for use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; using the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the Options button next to the de@@ bu@@ gger @-@ plug @-@ in drop @-@ down box , the specific settings can be changed . &quot;
&quot; if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , interface : &quot;
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . normally appears in the left do@@ cks .
&quot; a view in which all holding points , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower dock . &quot;
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger appears . normally appears in the lower do@@ cks .
&quot; depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or a part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; with this action the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger if necessary , or it tells the plugin to listen to de@@ bug demands . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that needs a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that in the normal case it is not necessary to pay attention to it . &quot;
the counterpart to de@@ bu@@ gging session starts the session . closes the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the listening to requirements .
send an HTTP request to the server to initiate a de@@ bug request . this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the de@@ bu@@ gger output view .
&quot; instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and to send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will continue . if it happens before a de@@ bug request has started , the script starts with the request . &quot;
&quot; instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution continues . &quot;
the de@@ bu@@ gger performs the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include .
&quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger comm@@ its the next instruction in the script , whereby if possible in functions and include it gets incorrect . &quot;
assign the de@@ bu@@ gger to pass the instruction and go to the next as if there is not the current one .
opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered which is to be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
&quot; with this dialog , a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set . &quot;
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work of Keith Is@@ dale as well as this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; front @-@ end and a K@@ part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g which they can find on htt@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g@@ .@@ s@@ f.@@ net with many other works of Keith .
&quot; this chapter describes how to customize &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to suit your needs and how to help you . &quot;
&quot; document type Edi@@ ting Pack@@ ages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to provide support for mark@@ up@@ - and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . their simplicity and flexibility makes &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; and D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and &amp; CSS ; s &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two file types , the tag folder and tag definitions . tag folder are handy , symbolic links of image buttons ( above the editing window ) , the text and instructions can insert more quickly into a document than a user could ever . &quot;
&quot; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or generated automatically from an existing DT@@ D . see for details about transformation . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how to create tag@@ ging XML files , then the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; . &quot;
tag@@ ging XML Files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags and the layout and content of the property dialog ; for the day . the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars allow for fast insertion of tags into a document without the risk of a writing error .
&quot; tag folder is nothing but folder . they only contain the file descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder carries the name of the description language and version , so there . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of tag@@ ging and declare whether they are necessary or not . although not all necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have better insight and more information in working with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of a tag XML document . it can only appear once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but it contains nothing but an element type . &quot;
the type of tag is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
valid for the class class only . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the type method . specify the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the day has a common attribute group and the attributes within this tag can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 ) &quot;
set a text in the dialog . this text is defined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a single element type element .
&quot; this element can only appear once for each attribute . it specifies the name and type of the attribute . in addition , there are other tags that describe how to display this attribute , etc ; This is a single element type element . &quot;
specifies the source code used to complete the attributes in the tag editing dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . is used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus can be used to achieve the data source .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface name and method name . the arguments passed to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tag . &quot;
a container tag that summ@@ ari@@ zes the elements of a list . it can only occur once for an attribute description . it is a single element type element .
defines the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
specify the position and size of a field in the dialog . this day should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this item is empty .
specifies a list of elements that may occur within the tag to be defined . this element is a single element type .
specifies a list of elements that end a day . this element is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files need to start with a &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
&quot; spaces do not affect anything , but pay attention &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; text &gt; will not cause a break , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
&quot; to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is in the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , window to start and check out Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . a further dialog will appear , the simple instructions to follow . &quot;
&quot; this function is currently not available yet . currently , the check is done only when loading Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
the following is an example of a family 1 day XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
the following is an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file is to be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&quot; &amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt; &quot;
&quot; the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple as there is an editor for it , at@@ tain@@ able via DT@@ D adap@@ ters DT@@ D settings . thus , di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created a simple &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries : &quot;
&quot; &#91; general &#93; Version = verse 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . ( - / / W3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Ni@@ ck@@ name = The simplified name of the DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name . &quot;
an action can be set with settings actions ... created . click New Action leads to the same dialog :
&quot; the short@@ cuts assigned to this action . by clicking the user defined button , a short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ one the current short@@ cut can be removed . &quot;
the simplest actions . it can be entered a text in the detector settings and when exec@@ uting the action this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below .
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action you can start external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that can change the document or use it as input ( or parts of the document ) . &quot;
&quot; first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified . for example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh . &quot;
although qualified paths are allowed it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in command line such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . By this way &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus can be found : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variables that can be used in the command line :
% f : we will be replaced with the URL of the current document . in the case of a local document file : / from the document name .
&quot; % p@@ id : will be replaced with PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , process . if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , only one instance will be added to the PID number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , by the external script . &quot;
&quot; the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or the path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the methods listed above , a script can be input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . in the input field input can be determined , which is to send to the default input . possibilities are : &quot;
selected text : the selected part of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is normally only useful with this setting .
&quot; depending on the input , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the standard output ; error messages sent to the standard output . it can be specified , which should be done with the text written on the default output , by setting the value in the output selection field : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to sub@@ divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create your own toolbar for each group . in the given case , there are not too many , therefore you can create a toolbar with the name of the brand . &quot;
&quot; once a tool bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings . &quot;
the parts of this window are rather self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
fill in all the required fields and add the tag to the matching toolbar .
&quot; complete all and , if the tag has attributes and you plan their use , enable dialog &quot; &quot; Edit day &quot; &quot; when available to enable entry when using the action . &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is that a ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let us replace it before we have difficulty .
&quot; to create a symbol that represents the action better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; choose from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphics Other Programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; used as default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixel , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size others . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created icon will not only help you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to the start of the day , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually called los , star@@ te , further interpreted ) , or should at least indicate a message to the user that clicking this symbol will insert ; start ; tag in the current document . &quot;
&quot; after creating the icon it still needs to be connected with the action . this is done through the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , ) and select the desired action . besides the text field there is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder where the saved symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the App@@ ly button and continue with other tags , as there are , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot;
&quot; suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus functions to the toolbar , or it should be shared for a better overview by some separ@@ ators in several groups . &quot;
&quot; after selecting the element to be added to the toolbar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the item to the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I would like to have a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or Pre@@ view . I will select it and add it to the toolbar . &quot;
please note how the separ@@ ators support group@@ ing . someone who does not know my toolbar might believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button .
the new toolbar has to be tested by proof@@ ing all symbols to ensure that everything works .
&quot; after new XML does not exist , it will be created im@@ root folder , but your toolbar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder . please adjust its file descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that its toolbar ( s ) will be loaded ( s ) when a file is opened from the corresponding type . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the most significant extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language that you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP documentation tree for my personal use . &quot;
before you start your own documentation you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory if someone has done this for you .
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you need to search for an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . we will leave the first part to you , the second we will treat here . &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = path , relative to this file , for example ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top Element = your description for these document@@ ations for example &amp; PHP ; 4.2 Docum@@ entation Section 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 1 = tag@@ .@@ html tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ .@@ html &quot;
&quot; the section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can see now in the &amp; PHP documentation ; documentation such a thing : &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE Con@@ fig file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of content , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x.@@ html Get@@ ting Star@@ ted = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic syntax ... &quot;
notice the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub @-@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the depth of the box ( except through reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
spaces do not affect anything but watch &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . resources files will be replaced .
&quot; the content section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is used to create context @-@ sensitive help . for example , when writing a PHP script , the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function is displayed . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file connection lines . &quot;
a simple list of context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can easily save your file do@@ cr@@ c to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc for local and global use . then create a folder ( as you specified it in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
&quot; if you are sure that these are good and well worth sharing , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. what documentation were used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ community . they will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share the separ@@ able resources ( D@@ TE@@ P pack@@ ets , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or else who are sent . in different places there is an email @-@ send menu entry , such as sending DT@@ D DT@@ D pack@@ et ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , tool bar tool bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the template and in the script tree . &quot;
&quot; the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , users can download them . the contributions are checked and only available if our team considers them to be correct and useful for publication . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading you are asked for your private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event that you have several keys , you can select one . in the dialog New resource , the input fields must be filled ( URL preview can be empty ) and clicking OK to start the upload . &quot;
&quot; up@@ loading can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , toolbar toolbar , and started in the context menu of files and folders in the template and scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , before installation , check &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the integrity of the resource by examining the integrity and signing . in case of problems it warns and it can then be abor@@ ted . if the integrity is given and the resource is signed correctly , a message appears with the source of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work in XML languages currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . however , the creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files could be necessary in tag@@ XML format . there is the simpler way to convert a DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package automatically . &quot;
&quot; the transformation can be started from the DT@@ D load menu and converting a DT@@ D . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description , which is to be used . after that , the following dialog appears : &quot;
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / d@@ war@@ p folders .
Doc@@ type Defini@@ tions : the string that is in ! Doc@@ type Tag such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e@@ .d@@ t@@ d
&quot; setting D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , after conversion the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . to understand them and to gain full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , one must first famili@@ arise themselves with these fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to bring these concepts to them without their understanding and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the working area is divided into three sections : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for everyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . from tool@@ bars to actions everything that is marked as global is stored in the shared folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this allows the group of administrators to back up different tool bars , actions and patterns in the global tree that will then be available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment . &quot;
local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; samples to tool@@ bars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply said this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the project folder of the project which em@@ powers the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project .
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of several main areas : the editor window , the tree view , the cart@@ ons with information and the tool@@ bars . please check in and for more detailed information about these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click the file leader with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document pass@@ able entries , such as close the current , other , or all file formats , rel@@ o@@ ad , delete or upload the document , jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right @-@ click in the editing pane will lead to a further context menu concerning the edited document content , such as the basic editing steps ( cut / copy / paste ) , edit the tag under the mouse poin@@ ter or open the file , when the string is called a file under the mouse poin@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; at the top end of the editor window are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional serves as a standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . &quot;
&quot; the use of toolbar buttons is really easy . if you want to insert a single tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; in your document , then click the icon that represents the tag . now you can insert the data for this just inserted tag . if you want to insert a day that has multiple attributes ( such as anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in a dialog with different fields . &quot;
&quot; the building man@@ views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow it to navigate in the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . to navigate , open it and to strip it . in the presentation with cart@@ ons are available for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation tree views . &quot;
&quot; project Management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this view shows all the files in the project and allows to manage the files in the project by right mouse click . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting the files from the storage medium can be done with the displayed context menu . &quot;
&quot; a further possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc ; all possibilities are open to you . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories depending on what context they are used . the category depends on the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , work@@ space . global templates are always available , local templates only available for the respective user and templates in projects are available only in the project . &quot;
&quot; here you will find information about the available scripts . the concept of the integration in Global , Local and Project works here too . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can access the available information to a script . &quot;
&quot; this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking an element , a list of commands opens in relation to the navigation and refres@@ her of the tree . &quot;
this tree appears under the other tree views . it can quickly change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . the application @-@ oriented application system allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks .
&quot; here is the complete documentation about web technology for your development . it can be downloaded pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , &apos; documentation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be added , edited and viewed project @-@ specific documentation . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , two trun@@ ks at the bottom of the window , can be accessed via the useful information : the message window and the problem window . &quot;
&quot; this tab shows information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to DT@@ D are shown . &quot;
this tab shows all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . -@@ scripts that are executed give all error messages ( as there are ) in this window .
&quot; the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command . the chocolate page of the tool@@ bars is the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , is the ability to send a toolbar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , sends the toolbar as a compressed T@@ ar archive via e @-@ mail ; . if they receive a toolbar in an email , they can secure and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; it is reasonable if you want to customize the place of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . to do this , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , enter . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed here . &quot;
&quot; if you have trouble starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in P@@ AT@@ H is located in front of their bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; was optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
&quot; during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with an underlying idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ? well , this would make him the absolutely greatest web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; constra@@ ined , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summ@@ arized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then the appropriate &amp; IDE . &quot;
&quot; now , to the above claim must be stated that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; developer community . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , not only this is possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to expand as they need it for their need . &quot;
&quot; and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus lets web developers increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document interface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , autom@@ ating almost every task . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and quickly developed to a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; plus is not associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; for more details , refer to help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or perform help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and managed by Eric L@@ aff@@ er Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; a quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not located , where the oldest entry is taken out . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use . if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported . &quot;
&quot; when inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board there , converted special characters to the &amp; HTML ; -@@ Sch@@ elling , so that they are displayed correctly and not be mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instructions . &quot;
&quot; convert the text from clip@@ board into &amp; URL ; -@@ S@@ elling , which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily to insert &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor day . &quot;
switch the block selection on or off . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift ; key .
this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP script exec@@ utes error messages !
search a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a sort of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window in which you can see the display of scripts and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
exit and switch on the problem re@@ porter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem re@@ porter is activated as soon as you change to the structure tree .
displays the toolbar icons to the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
&quot; if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu together with the entries present or next , depending on the position of the cursor in the document . &quot;
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu according to the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects are saved using the extension .@@ web@@ pl@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
search the project directory for new files that could be there . this allows you to copy video files to your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
upload the files in your project to the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
&quot; settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , which manages the project . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you will find the details explained . &quot;
loads a project tool bar . these are stored in project files / Tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned it to this project .
a dialog to store your toolbar . allows you to select the type of toolbar : local or project .
&quot; open a dialog to add a new toolbar . this will only create the name . actions must be saved by means of settings actions ... Add to toolbar , or you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; removes a tool bar from the field of view . this does not delete them from the hard drive . if you haven &apos;t saved the toolbar yet , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do this . &quot;
with this you can send your own toolbar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ) team so that the toolbar will be present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as app@@ endi@@ x .
&quot; enables the up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone else can access it . see in . &quot;
load a &amp; DT@@ D ; you or anyone else has made and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; your own description format .
refresh / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it is useful if the entities are to be refres@@ hed without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and there is no write permission in the global K@@ DE folder the load fails .
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags present in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the standard ( HTML ; ) toolbar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu standard in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar . &quot;
&quot; allows access to the current day settings dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent insertion of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent insertion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . past@@ ing using tool bar refuses to comply with the rules this day . &quot;
&quot; in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plu@@ gins are listed under the menu items above . click on them . &quot;
select the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schemes depends on the posters ; -@@ version .
&quot; sel@@ ects the type of line @-@ ending identification . very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms for development . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh . &quot;
check the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; by means of the external application ti@@ dy .
&quot; instant switching between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in K@@ DE libraries , the switching over sometimes may need time or create unpleasant graphics . recommended is the card @-@ card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu provides an entry for every open sub@@ window . selecting an entry will enable the corresponding sub@@ window . &quot;
switches on or off display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
&quot; the changes in this dialog influence every application using the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser . &quot;
setting up the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of posters ; find details .
a dialog appears where you delete entries from the tool@@ bars or which add and modify the sequences .
&quot; this should generate a help according to the environment of the mouse , but is not implemented yet . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus development in financial form , they find the way here . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should preferably be filled up from top to bottom , as after filling out the project name the whole directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed automatically . all these paths and author information fields can later be set using Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering name , file will be filled automatically . &quot;
&quot; this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lower@@ case and without spaces with the extension web@@ pl@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pl@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory . &quot;
&quot; here is the server address of the machine you want to access , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ nam@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol will be used . depending on the setting of the remote host an adjustment could be necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder in which the templates are saved for the project . it is a relative path to the project and standard templates . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and tool@@ bars by default . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
this allows to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem to the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
&quot; this setting is great if you have a static web content you want to download and change . for ser@@ vers@@ al scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently . &quot;
&quot; let it be checked when files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project are to be integrated . if a project is started anew , no hook . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can select an exact selection of goo@@ dies . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by hook or , by removing the tick , cl@@ inging from the project . &quot;
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . you can upload these settings in the menu with project project properties in the sub @-@ window profiles or change with the Shift ; F@@ 7 key .
some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in detail . the additional entries are explained below .
&quot; a list of file names ( plac@@ eholders possible ) , which are completely ignored in project @-@ related operations such as project folders . &quot;
&quot; additional option to top , including files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views . &quot;
this allows you to select the desired de@@ bu@@ gger . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin can be set with the Options button .
&quot; in the sub @-@ window profiles , upload profiles ( see in ) can be set as well as the display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile , by adding an own tree view for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the team configuration sub@@ window , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details . &quot;
&quot; in the event configuration sub@@ window , you can turn event actions and add , change or delete these actions . event actions are executed when a previously defined event occurs , such as securing a file . see the details . &quot;
by default opens &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . the last project that was opened . this behavior cannot be influenced at the moment .
to open another project select Open Project ... from the menu project or the icon project open from the toolbar . the dialog project will be displayed and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pl@@ j as enlargement .
&quot; when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , closed , the project file is automatically saved . you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , changed files . the same happens when you load a new project . &quot;
the project tree view gives free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
&quot; folder beha@@ ves as well , but the entries open and open with ... in the context menu with the right mouse button : &quot;
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
&quot; allows removal of the current profile . if only a profile is present , the button will be blin@@ ded to prevent removal . &quot;
&quot; the password will be retained in the core memory and forgotten when it comes to programming . this option is useful when common up@@ loading of files is necessary , and the rather uns@@ af@@ e password on the disk will not be questioned . &quot;
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog when you change your mind before up@@ loading .
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many upload profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed : &quot;
this is the server name on which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
&quot; the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least , you should choose from &amp; ft@@ p ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs . &quot;
&quot; the port for the transfer . normally this does not have to be changed , except the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your shock wave , this is either a time @-@ saving function or danger . use it at your discretion . the password will be stored on the disk , so that it cannot be read easily , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is just a set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in a project , i.e. by simply changing the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; views can be stored , opened , or deleted from the Project or Project Tool@@ bar in the Project or Project toolbar . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has to do the most . this not only helps increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to their own way of working . &quot;
&quot; as mentioned above , tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus can be designed best via the toolbar . use and addition differ . the addition of tool@@ bars is discussed below in the Ad@@ ding of tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; tool bars and symbols can be set either by means of a context menu ( right @-@ click on the toolbar ) , in which other actions such as toolbar can be removed , toolbar or toolbar can be executed , which can be specified in the dialog where the actions on this or other toolbar can be visible . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a toolbar , the entries will be removed and action works displayed that are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the toolbar and the actions on them can be set up in the menu with Settings tool@@ bars ... and set settings actions .. set .
&quot; templates are essentially document skel@@ et@@ ons , code cut@@ lets and files for connecting . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , basically used templates as a common file system with extended organization and interfaces . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions outlined at the beginning of each template prior to use .
&quot; binary is all that is not pure text . it can be binary files except text , i.e. images , &amp; PDF ; s , flash files &amp; etc . binary templates are usually found in documents using links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . &quot;
&quot; documents can be of any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . usually , more specific documents are created in appropriate sub@@ folders . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . see for more information on the template tree . &quot;
&quot; these types of templates are useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents based on a template , but the same text area . you can find everything from a comment about a final grade up to a complete menu system on Jav@@ ascript or Perl basis . &quot;
&quot; they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summ@@ arized in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; create a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and choose File as template Save as local template ... &quot;
&quot; once this has been done , you will notice that ( even if it was stored as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . see the template tree under project templates . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document and click File As template to save as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be easily drawn with drag and drop to the tree view templates . &quot;
&quot; creating binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . all file management functions can be used for it , such as dra@@ gging and dropping or past@@ ing over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; you can click on a folder on the right of the file tree or in the project files tree view , enter a name for the template and back up . by default it is saved in the project folder , but of course it can also be stored as local or global template . &quot;
&quot; project templates enable a very goal @-@ oriented approach . you can pre@@ tend he@@ aders and foot@@ ers or dynamically create with &amp; PHP ; create , insert files or link them with them . in addition , you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects . &quot;
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files submitted in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers as explained above .
&quot; to set the behavior of a folder , right click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears : &quot;
&quot; a selection box with the three types described above ; files , text or templates . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default and fits all except the root folders in the template overview . if a root folder is set in such a way , it would de@@ activate templates in this path except they would appear explicitly . if nothing appears , you will probably be in a root folder . &quot;
allows to copy general head@@ lines or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and allow for copying of contents to a folder with special he@@ aders / foot@@ ers to equip a whole presentation with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
&quot; in addition , you have a context menu ( pointing to right mouse button ) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and past@@ ing templates from one place to another . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , provides two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source code editor that can be accessed through the View menu . the first mode replaces the source code editor with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the second one divi@@ des the editor window into two parts : the source code editor and the V@@ PL ; editor . &quot;
&quot; the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and a cursor appears . then you can edit and switch back to the source code editor when needed , in which the performed changes in the V@@ PL ; editor are visible in the source code . &quot;
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; Editor on a document that contains &amp; PHP ; contains , a small green symbol shows the V@@ oh@@ er@@ ead of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . &quot;
&quot; second mode works just like the first one except that the changes are visible in both the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor , and the cursor is active in the source code editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor , this mode is already active , puts the active cursor from one window to the other , while maintaining the position in the document . &quot;
&quot; the synchron@@ isation distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source code editor can be set up via settings Qu@@ anta .... After selecting V@@ PL ; view , you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation applies : a small range for fast computers and a large range for slow . &quot;
&quot; assuming that you want to change the title of the website , tools can be selected . this allows editing of invisible tags when working with the V@@ PL ; Editor is also called when a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; editor . &quot;
&quot; met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document itself , e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . one click on the list allows to change the content , e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the contents column . &quot;
CSS rules are the new way to design the appearance of pages in your browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons under the list . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file @-@ open button and selecting the appropriate file .
&quot; the cursor is like in a word processor , by moving with the arrows . under rare circumstances , the cursor beha@@ ves like usual . text can be inserted by typing , and deleted by pressing a button or removing button . &quot;
&quot; inser@@ ting tags will be done in the same way via tool@@ bars , as in the source text editor . it should be noted that inser@@ ting tags before already existing identical tags is not removed e.g. when an anchor day , surrounded with text , must be removed any other surrounding anchor day . &quot;
&quot; some toolbar buttons , such as the She@@ et Assistant or the Listen @-@ Assistant , are disabled . they will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; function , in this release , the tables or lists must be used tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the examination of style sheets . in contrast to other programs for style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of the style template can be tra@@ cked . &quot;
&quot; to be able to compile successfully , except for &amp; k@@ de ; the libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and Lib@@ XML , which are already present at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de . &quot;
&quot; new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db compatibility mode , orph@@ aned fixing points can be set in a particular file and line number , and later activated . &quot;
&quot; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g returns the full path from a fil@@ en@@ ame without path@@ name . fil@@ en@@ ames in the same folder as the upper@@ most loaded style file named con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g , for example , a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l is possible to enter the following input : &quot;
&quot; in this command , a partial or complete agreement with a pre@@ position named QNAP or a specified mode name is checked . &amp; eg ; template matches with any QNAP that contains the template template . &quot;
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNAP &quot; is extended by the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 will be extended to htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 19@@ 9 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a requested stop @-@ point must be resolved for the associated UR@@ I and line number . this is automatically done when loading the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g .

&quot; several commands require more than one argument . quotes can be used to pass merged expressions as an argument . &amp; eg ; : with the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; &quot; As an argument , a holding point is set in a file named &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; . &quot;

&quot; there are many graphical tools for comparing , so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I wrote . &quot;
&quot; the merge was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation at many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . &quot;
&quot; the program used by me only showed me the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly was changed within these lines . and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . merging these changes was a small night@@ mare . &quot;
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences within a line and changes to white characters . later a lot more useful functions were added .
&quot; for example , if you want to compare text quickly , simply copy it to the clip@@ board and insert it into one of the comparative windows . &quot;
a function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full file browser .
&quot; this is useful when two people work independently from each other on a piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps resol@@ ving conflicts and simultaneously displays the result to be expected . in this editor , you can even directly edit the result . the screen shot shows three source files when merging : &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you comparing and merging complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder merge :
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you frequently have to check code , you will like this function . &quot;
&quot; differences in white characters and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed visible . if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters , one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column at the left side . ( no more anno@@ y@@ ance if someone changes the ind@@ entation . ) &quot;
&quot; if a file is the same and the other differs in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both are different . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name , but in different folders , then you can make typing easier by simply writing the fil@@ en@@ ame of the first file . for example : &quot;
k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 Fol@@ der 2 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder @-@ 1 folder @-@ 2 folder @-@ 1 folder @-@ 1 folder @-@ 2 folder @-@ 3 folder
&quot; open dialog enables manual typing of fil@@ en@@ ames , selecting a file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . &quot;
&quot; when you select a folder , the merge or merge of folders is initiated . if for A a file is selected , for B and C , however , a folder , then used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; if merging is checked , the input field is active for the target and can be edited . however , it is not necessary to specify an output file immediately . you can also do this step later when saving . &quot;
the Set@@ ting button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can set options before starting the same / merging .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison then starts immediately . in Open dialog , you do not need to select files , you can simply close the dialog with the Canc@@ el button . &quot;
you can also use dra@@ gging and dropping : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window .
&quot; sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to figure out how similar these functions are , that would be a relatively big effort . you should first create two corresponding files , load them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then you can simply copy , paste and then compare the relevant sections . &quot;
&quot; note : currently , you can &apos;t remove anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only dropping text into a comparison window will be supported . &quot;
warning : some editors interpret the dra@@ gging and dropping text into another program than cut and paste ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case your original data could be lost .
&quot; the info line of the source pane contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) Every Info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , leave the mouse over the line for a while . &quot;
&quot; the three source windows are the letters A , B and C. A has the color blue , B the color green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these preferences can be changed through the settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; when a difference is detected , one can see the color , which file differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files . that &apos;s good in the next section ( merging ) . &quot;
&quot; in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few rare cases . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line separating the assembly column from the text is interrupted at the places where the source file has no lines . if the line breaks is enabled , the line is dotted with broken lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( below the comparison windows ) also has an info row with the inscription : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; changes &#93; when you have edited the result . usually , it contains already text by automatic merging , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
&quot; ! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use the S@@ prin@@ ge buttons to the next solved / un@@ solved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . ) &quot;
&quot; if only two comparison windows are used , each difference is also a conflict that needs to be solved manually . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows , the group belonging to the row will be marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; this text does not appear in the final saved file , nor in a selection that you may copy and insert somewhere else . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; Conf@@ lic@@ t Conf@@ lic@@ t ; however , appears in the clip@@ board , if you copy such text from the result window . carefully go with this function . &quot;
&quot; note : when selecting sources , ignor@@ ing the options , ignor@@ ing ignor@@ es C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters . &quot;
&quot; when you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , bottom , page on , right , high , bottom , page on , right , end , C@@ trl @-@ Start and C@@ trl @-@ End , Si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs . &quot;
&quot; in the Au@@ ctions window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . with the In@@ sert button , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insertion mode . ) &quot;
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summ@@ aries synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as already explained in the merging and the edi@@ table output window ) .
&quot; the toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous difference ( C@@ trl @-@ Down / C@@ trl @-@ Up ) , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ image ) or to the next / previous un@@ solved conflict . therefore , between resolved and un@@ resolved conflicts must be distinguished . &quot;
&quot; to copy the selection to the clip@@ board , you must press the Copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ In@@ sert ) . there is also the option selection automatically copied . however , be careful with this option , but be careful because you could acci@@ dentally over@@ write the contents of the clip@@ board . &quot;
&quot; new@@ lines are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix variants use a new@@ line character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use cart return + line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not keep the len@@ ders of the source files , so you should not use bin@@ aries . &quot;
the options and the list of the most recently used files will be saved automatically at the end and restored at the next start . ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set up ... )
&quot; select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog also displays fonts with variable width to choose , but you should not use them . ) &quot;
&quot; if you activate this option , differences in recur@@ sive script will be displayed . if the selected font does not support this display , nothing happens at all . &quot;
&quot; in systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors may not be available in its pure form , but would be rendered more ast@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; if this option is enabled , the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressed the tab key . otherwise , a tab character is inserted . &quot;
&quot; when you press Enter or Return , the ind@@ entation of the preceding line is automatically used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; if this option is enabled , each selection is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . copy the manual copy to the clip@@ board . &quot;
you can select which line @-@ end type you prefer to save . the default value is the generally usual selection on the operating system used .
&quot; when comparing files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , to find all fully identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step white signs are not ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) will save a character &apos; \ \ &apos; and a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; at the end of one line , while others will be ignored . if this option is checked , you will be treated as a white character . while merging , this option has to be disabled . in default , this is disabled . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; -@@ &apos; ) are ignored . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments will be treated as changes in white characters . &quot;
&quot; the option is enabled in default . it is effective for complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files . &quot;
&quot; in auto @-@ jump mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next un@@ solved conflict is inj@@ ected . &quot;
automatic selection solves all conflicts in white characters using the selected file as a source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white characters are less important in many files . note that the automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments when the options ignore numbers or ignore ignor@@ es C / C + + comments .
these options are discussed in the chapter to scan folders and run a merge . see for details under documentation to compare and merge .
&quot; if a file is saved and already an older version exists , then the original version will be app@@ ended to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if such a backup file already exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
&quot; adapt the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current program . you need to quit and restart , so that the change is active . ( this option is not available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set globally through the control center . ) &quot;
&quot; the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if this option is checked , the upper setting is used for all entries . &quot;
through the selection fields for the encoding a short note appears what the local code is . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character for you . )
&quot; adjust the file encoding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted . since the encoding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different encoding can be compared and merged . &quot;
&quot; if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding to be used for saving . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre @-@ processing commands , they might not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files could be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII ) . &quot;
switch this to supp@@ ress high@@ lighting changes in white characters in text or reviews . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore ignor@@ es C / C + + comments . )
&quot; this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences between two of three files will be displayed . but sometimes you might want to see only the differences between two of three files . after selecting A &amp; lt ; &amp; gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; C or B &amp; lt ; C or B &amp; lt ; C or B &amp; lt ; C or B &amp; lt ; C or B &amp; lt ; C or B &amp; lt ; C or B &amp; lt ; C or B &amp; lt . &quot;
sometimes you would like to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply remove the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
&quot; sometimes view the differences and then decide ab@@ rup@@ tly to merge the files . a simple click starts the merge and uses the fil@@ en@@ ame of the last source file as default name for output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge operation , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will first pass this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor that matches your requirements . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will first pass this external command . if a standard word processor command is specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is the input of this command command . you can write your own pre@@ processor that matches your requirements . each input line must have a corresponding output line . &quot;
&quot; the idea behind this is to give the user more flexibility in setting up the Di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed and most users do not want to program that by themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l completely sufficient . &quot;
use this word processor command for new@@ lines to convert in capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; This . * refers to the found text in one line . the \ \ U converts the found text in upper@@ case letters .
CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to insert automatically generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / keyword sub@@ stitution ) . * \ \ $ / \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; while you experiment with sed , you might start to understand it and maybe you might like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
&quot; ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for a further processing command for line spac@@ ing . &quot; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and any hit will be replaced by nothing , so quasi deleted . &quot;
sometimes you might want to perform several re@@ plac@@ ements at one time . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the sub@@ stitu@@ tions from one another . example :
&quot; instead of sed you can also use something else like per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos; s / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / replace / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; How@@ ever , per@@ l needs some details . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the leading &apos; \ \ &apos; . example : &quot;
the data after the normal pre@@ processor are retained for displaying and merging . the other operations only change the data that the new@@ line al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ m looks .
&quot; note : in rare cases when you use a normal pre@@ processor , the new@@ line pre@@ processor displays the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hides differences , you may acci@@ dentally notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data . &quot;
&quot; often programmers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge entire folders with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders . &quot;
... makes a proposal for each object to merge ; you can customize the proposal before starting
... can simulate the merging and display the simulated changes without really carrying them out
... &quot; performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) , &quot;
this is very similar to comparing and merging individual files . you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog .
&quot; if three folders are merged , folder 1 will be used as a base . if no destination folder has been specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; Fol@@ der 3 as destination folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not merging . to start merging , you need to select the respective menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( see more details . ) &quot;
&quot; while reading the folder , you will be informed about a small message window about current progress . if you cancel the scanning of the folder , only the files that have been compared then are listed . &quot;
&quot; when scanning the folders is completed , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left ... &quot;
each file and folder that was found during the scan is displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually shown together . you can open a folder by double @-@ clicking on the + / - or double @-@ clicking on the object . the directory menu contains two functions to fold down all sub@@ directories and open all sub@@ directories with which you can open or fold up all folders .
&quot; if you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison will be started and a comparison window appears . &quot;
the icon in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folders , this is visible in the A / B / C columns and in the Details Pan@@ e to the selected object . in such a case the merge action cannot be automatically selected . &quot;
&quot; as seen in the above picture , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C. &quot;
&quot; for identical entries , however , the color is identical , even if the age of entries is different . &quot;
folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical . then folders have the same color . at folders the age is ir@@ relevant for its color .
&quot; the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf that is green , then yellow and later when it is old , red . &quot;
&quot; a and C are identical , but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a , B and C do not have the same type of file ( e.g. if A is a folder and B file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faulty objects exist , the merge operation cannot be started . &quot;
... &quot; A and B do not have the same type of file ( e.g. if A is a folder and B file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faulty objects exist , the merge operation cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; the sync mode is active if only two folders and no explicit target folder have been specified and if the option directories are synchron@@ ized . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that afterwards both folders are identical . if for one entry ... &quot;
... &quot; A and B exist , but not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ames for output file only B ; directly after merging &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. ) &quot;
&quot; if two folders are merged and select the new file instead of merge ( unsure ) then checked &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and displays the newer file to copy . if the files are different , but the date is identical .. As long as such errors are not fixed , the merging of the folders cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; while merging a file is worked after the other . you status column displays the right when merging is successful , and according to other messages when something unexpected happens . if the merge is complete , you should make a final check and see if the status is okay all over . &quot;
&quot; if the file comparison method is selected in the setup dialog , K@@ Diff@@ user will display more columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , deleted , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts will only be displayed if three folders are compared or merged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the merge actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start merging . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you have no destination folder , then in the three folder merge mode C is used as the target , in the two @-@ folder merge , B is selected as the target and when synchron@@ izing A and / or B will be used as a target . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a destination folder , please check that all entries should be in the destination folder , also displayed in the folder structure . there are some options by which certain entries could be ski@@ pped . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises : &quot;
&quot; to merge all entries , select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) . to merge just the current entry , select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 . &quot;
&quot; if conflic@@ ting file types still exist invalid link actions , a message appears that indicates the incorrect elements . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; when you merge all entries , a dialog box appears with the options Browse , simulate and cancel . &quot;
&quot; select Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without actually making any changes . then , you will get a complete list of all actions . &quot;
&quot; if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge @-@ window opens ( note the screen@@ shot ) . &quot;
&quot; when you are finished with a file , select / continue your directory merge again or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , a corresponding dialog appears . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; continue his work with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; if you click on an error , a message and detailed status information will appear . at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to select the cause of the problem . &quot;
&quot; if some entries have been individually combined , remember &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and do not merge them again at the later compilation of all entries . even if the merge action has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be merged again . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again . &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set up ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . separate patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not match this pattern .
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS . many aut@@ mati@@ cally created files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this folder can be configured with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
&quot; in some file systems , files have a default attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems , a preceded poin@@ ter marks a file as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in default . &quot;
&quot; when the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is de@@ activated in default . &quot;
&quot; if the option is turned on , the links will be treated as normal folders and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not checked for possible recur@@ sions . a link to a folder that contains a link to itself would lead to an endless loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; crashes . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; complete analysis of each file and displays the statisti@@ c columns . ( the number of deleted , un@@ resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files that do not contain any text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot;
&quot; if you compare large folders through a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the change date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain degree of security . please use caution . this option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; similar to the date of the change , there is no real comparison . the files are considered identical if they are equal . for example , this can be useful when the change date has been lost . please use caution . this option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; enable the synchronization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder has been specified . in this mode , the proposals for merging will be selected so that afterwards both folders are identical . also the results from merging files are stored in both folders . this option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , the copying of the newer file will be proposed as action instead of merging the newer file . ( this is considered uns@@ af@@ e as it is assumed that the other file has not been modified . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , then the original version will be renamed and the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file already exists with the .@@ ori@@ g extension , it will be deleted without further backup . this also affects the normal merging of individual files , not just the merging of entire folders . this option is enabled in default . &quot;
&quot; normally , the folder merge view will be visible to merge individual files ; you can shift the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want this , you can switch off the main window in the window menu and switch between the list and text windows between the two views . &quot;
&quot; you can also directly merge a single file without having to start the folder merge . to do this , use the current file merge from the merging menu . to do this , use the current file merge from the merging menu . &quot;
&quot; this status , however , is lost when you read the directory again : directory menu : re @-@ read &quot;
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folders to open that are located on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders .
&quot; a path can be relative und@@ one or .. contained . it is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute . &quot;
&quot; special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , empty string &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes by the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations : &quot;
&quot; or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows . then , a file is accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no way to edit permissions or modification date . therefore , the permissions or the modification date devi@@ ate from the original . ( please refer to the confidentiality of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . ) &quot;
the main purpose is currently as a difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP . K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP first always starts the built @-@ in difference viewer . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 click the right mouse button over the difference viewer and then choose In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part view from the context menu .
&quot; normally needed &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two full input files . however , if it is applied as a K@@ Part , it takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names of the original files are removed from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch will start to recover the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the Con@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select Pre@@ view in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since generating the patch file . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part it is performed , it only supports comparing two files , a very small toolbar and menu . merging or comparing folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode . &quot;
&quot; tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now it is compact ) already exist . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ user already indicates that it can perform together like the program diff@@ 3 from the diff tool collection . &quot;
I have been using GP@@ L programs for quite a long time and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs .
&quot; you compiled the program from the sources and probably didn &apos;t tell the configure script the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in default , configure is installed in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is treated as not identical . &quot;
&quot; the editor is aware of any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . however , this is lost if the result is simply saved by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C. This important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could store this information . &quot;
the effort has been too large so far . you can always restore a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit large amounts of text should be used by another editor .
&quot; no sr@@ c has been removed after removing text ; no sr@@ c has been removed , and the text cannot be deleted . what does that mean and how can that be removed ? &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses already many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and missed the purpose . please use another editor for this .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later .
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ user on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .

&quot; to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to compile and install , use the following command in the basic folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution : &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE @-@ dir specifies the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , see more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file . &quot;
&quot; because &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake , you should not have any problems with comp@@ iling . if difficulties pers@@ ist , please report to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mail@@ ing@@ lists of them . &quot;
cut out ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Shift @-@ Rem@@ ove ) into the clip@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ trl @-@ V or Shift @-@ In@@ sert ) insert the text from the clip@@ board at the current cursor position or replaces the current marker .
&quot; show only differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore also not in the destination folder . &quot;
&quot; ( in the current program version , you need to re @-@ read the folder with the Ref@@ res@@ h function after changes to these options . ) &quot;
&quot; if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after merging . ( the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons to select the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini preview of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the work surfaces , change their size , quit them or move them . this works both inside a desktop as well as in several . &quot;
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work areas as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button you can move windows within &amp; p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both inside a desktop as well as on other working surfaces .
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : when cli@@ cked on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the context menu has only the two entries p@@ ager ... and end . if however , the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries minimize , maximize , on desktop and end . &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
&quot; if this check box is selected , window frames can be moved within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other working surfaces . &quot;
&quot; if this field is checked , the names of the virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are shown in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; tick this field lets the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager display ; display numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is displayed along with name , the names are provided with folder numbers , eg ; 1st Desktop . &quot;
&quot; if this field is checked , the background of each desktop is also shown as background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; if this field is checked , the running programs will be shown as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only the empty work areas are displayed to enable their selection . &quot;
&quot; here , the view of the program window is selected . simply displays simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the window with its default symbol and pixel shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems . &quot;
&quot; here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classic lets &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ N grid appear , as from P@@ ager applications in some other window managers ; horizontal displays all virtual work surfaces in a horizontal and vertical row in a vertical row , which is very good for viewing later@@ ally on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , display and move the windows as symbols or with their content . besides , it runs outside the control bar . &quot;
right @-@ click inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then set up switch @-@ down sel@@ ector ... allows the dialog to appear .
&quot; currently , this cannot be changed in the dialog . however , you can do this manually : &quot;
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you don &apos;t have a write permission for the file , you need to login as a user root or turn to your system administrator . &quot;

&quot; this application is interesting for various users : these include artists , web designers and people with visual impair@@ ment . this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; K@@ mag . &quot;
&amp; K@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly expanded to include new features . it is optimized for use on low @-@ performance computers .
&quot; if you start &amp; click , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; K@@ mag ; shows the enlarged area of the screen . below is the enlarged area of the screen . the image shown in the magni@@ fying window is an enlarged area of the screen and is described below as a selection window . &quot;
&quot; in default , it enlar@@ ges &amp; K@@ mag ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter like a mo@@ ve@@ able lou@@ pe . alternatively , you can set a selected part of the screen in the magni@@ fying window ( drop @-@ down mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; at the left edge of the screen ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to avoid that the mouse cursor is displayed in the enlarged window , select the setting mouse poin@@ ter . please note that the mouse poin@@ ter is not yet able to recognize the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the standard k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; mouse poin@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; in the drop @-@ down mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse keys and change its size . this can be done in the following way : &quot;
&quot; move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fying window and hold down the left mouse button , so you can capture and move the content of the magni@@ fying window . this also works with the arrow keys . &quot;
&quot; in addition , if you press the &amp; Shift ; press the button or use the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the selection window . &quot;
&quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the selection window will remain fixed and only the bottom right corner is to move . &quot;
&quot; you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , save into a file , copy to clip@@ board ( to insert later into other applications ) , rotate the image and much more . &quot;
starts / stops the update of the display . stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go against 0 .
&quot; select the refresh rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the refresh rate , the more CPU time is required . &quot;
&quot; in this mode , a selection window will be displayed . the selected area will be displayed in a window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ mag ; uses automatically your set short commands to save files , open a new window , print , rel@@ o@@ ad ( with the button document rel@@ o@@ ad in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and cr@@ ushing &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; K@@ mag is also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; it is a screen lu@@ pe . you can use &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; for this purpose , you can use a magni@@ fier to view the small print in a newspaper or a photo . this application is useful for various people : from research or artist to web designer or visually impaired . &quot;
you can find more detailed user documentation with help : / K@@ mag ( either type this URL to the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; one or start k@@ help@@ center help : / K@@ mag ) .

&quot; m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click , as soon as the mouse cursor freezes for a while at the same location . it is intended to help people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome ( peti@@ tive @-@ Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury syndrome ) and which each mouse click prepares pain . &quot;
&quot; m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click , as soon as the mouse cursor freezes for a while at the same location . it is intended to help people who suffer pain from the peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and which each mouse click em@@ ulate . however , this requires little practice . &quot;
&quot; m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain arising when you click the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you may also consult a doctor if this has not happened yet . &quot;
&quot; to make it clear again : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain caused by moving the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic tools , the result can be different for everyone . &quot;
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and runs a mouse click once you break the movement briefly .
&quot; move the mouse , wait until the mouse button is pressed . now move the mouse , wait until the mouse button is pressed . in this way , you can drag the mouse with pressed mouse button . the smart move requires a little exercise , but you get used to it quickly . &quot;
this residence time must be pet@@ ri@@ fied at the end of the mouse movement before you click on the m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool .
&quot; if Intel@@ lig@@ ently shifting is enabled , the shooting time ( 1 / 10 s ) is activated . here , the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after dropping the mouse button , wait before it release the mouse button again when no moving of the mouse occurs . &quot;
&quot; if this function is activated , a slow moving to the right and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow moving to the left and back results in a double click . &quot;
&quot; if the sound appears delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; to shor@@ ten the response time . go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System , and here the General tab . there is a sli@@ ders sound buffer , which you set to lower value to shor@@ ten the response times . &quot;
&quot; this setting is marked , and k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is started ; at any start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only available under &amp; k@@ de ; available . for G@@ NO@@ ME or other Window Environ@@ ments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically . &quot;
&quot; reset all settings to the values set while opening the dialog . if you already press the App@@ ly button , the settings will be reset to the status after the user has been pressed . &quot;
&quot; use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool at first ; first with the default settings . in particular , the smart move should be switched off first . if you have become accustomed to the automatic click , you can later take the smart move away . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response time of &amp; k@@ de ; with sounds . &quot;
&quot; first of all , you should be aware of which places a mouse click remains without effect : clicking on the neutral constitu@@ ents of windows or in places in the browser window that does not display any link leads to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park your mouse in such places until you want to use them again . &quot;
&quot; when your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually pretty simple . the trick is that you not only clean the mouse ball , but also the rollers that come into contact with the mouse ball . &quot;
&quot; first you have to remove the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be clear when you see the under@@ side of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . the dirt and the dirt can easily scra@@ pe with a flat blade or the f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you use an intelligent shift in this case , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button . &quot;
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use another window manager and move a window .
&quot; the solution to this problem is that you can run a mouse click yourself . as a result , the status of the m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is reset and you can continue working as usual . &quot;
&quot; problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to run mouse clicks and insert the cursor to another location . &quot;
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cursor over where you want it . however , use the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop when you want to make a ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ ke . secure zones for the mouse poin@@ ter are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the toolbar and menus and the title lines of windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with intelligent shifting , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text . &quot;
&quot; intelligent shifting is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes time before you can handle it . it is very likely to select this way to copy it to the clip@@ board , or to insert any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . here are some advice : &quot;
&quot; use the smart move not when you just start using it . instead , select a mouse click at one end of the text area and hold the Shift key while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again . &quot;
&quot; use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this will each time , when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse click . later , you can use the intelligent shift also without the audi@@ ble mouse click . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window needs to be installed . this should be the case on most systems . &quot;
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse @-@ click is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and these are correctly set up .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; press the mouse button once the mouse cursor freezes for a short time . this program is designed for people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome and which causes pain to be pressed .
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to begin a certain time that a drag process starts , before the mouse button is released . in this way , dra@@ gging and dropping can also be performed with the mouse . &quot;
a more detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ( either type this &amp; URL ; enter the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; one or start k@@ help@@ center help : / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ) .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that allows dum@@ b users to let their computer speak for themselves .
&quot; with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , dum@@ b users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can select sentences from a list with the conversation history that are to be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; on the first page of the wizard ( left screen shot ) , enter the command which will be used later for the text output of text . for more details see the description of the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; on the second page , you can choose the standard text passages . from the text passages , you can often choose used text passages without typing them . the text passages can of course be edited . &quot;
&quot; on the third page ( right screen shot ) , you can define the vocabulary for words . &amp; k@@ mouth ; read the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of each word . additionally , you can synchron@@ ize the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words can be included in the vocabulary . &quot;
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and contains essentially an input field for the ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ kes of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen shot ) and a running memory of the already spoken sets ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
&quot; when you have k@@ mouth ; correctly set up , you can enter the pro@@ positions in the input field you want to hear . each spoken sentence is app@@ ended to the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . you can select sets that are to be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; with the menu entry settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; . this dialog contains two learning flash@@ cards , voice output and settings , the Vor@@ ter@@ gän@@ ger page as well as the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the voice output box , enter the command to call the language generator . in the drop @-@ down box below the input field , you specify the character encoding , with the text transmitted to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box , if the text should be passed as default to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command to voice output depends on your language generator . you will find this command in the documentation to your language generator . examples of this are included in the app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; when it &apos;s successful , the other settings on this page will be ignored . the t@@ t@@ d language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ da@@ emon , der &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standardized interface for voice output is currently being developed . the choice of this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection box action after selecting a text passage , you decide which action is triggered by the keyboard short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the Text passages menu or in the bar for text passages . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of Instant Mess@@ ages , the chosen text passage is directly spoken and added to the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage is entered only in the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second drop down of the editing window for text passages , you can specify whether the text pass@@ book should be saved automatically when closing the editing window . &quot;
&quot; save the book with the selection of text passages . if you choose to reject changes , the text message book will not be saved . if you want to ask before saving , ask &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text pas@@ sage@@ book is to be saved . &quot;
&quot; the list of words contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the words of words . in the main window beside the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a drop @-@ down box , if this list contains more than one dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons on the right of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . &quot;
&quot; select the desired language for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then read the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of the individual words is simply determined by counting the assignment . additionally , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only correctly written words into the new dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with this option , you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then asks what dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they should be weigh@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; with this option you create a new , empty dictionary with no entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically add to the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time . &quot;
&quot; the main section of the window for editing text passages is divided into two . in the upper part , the text passages are represented as tree structure . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the corresponding keyboard short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passage book , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; add actions such as new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books , you can either get through the selection in the menu bar , in the toolbar , or via a drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
&quot; the order of text passages or text passages can change by dra@@ gging with the mouse to the new position , or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; key . &quot;

&quot; the selected text is copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used otherwise the selected areas of the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . &quot;
&quot; the currently active proposition is spoken . if text is in the input field , it will be used otherwise the selected sentences of the exp@@ iry date . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is checked , a sliding tool bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . by default , the tool bar is located directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the sh@@ aded left side and pulling the toolbar can be moved to another location . &quot;
&quot; this menu entry is checked , a narrow strip is displayed in the lower part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if not checked , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is checked , a sliding bar for text passages is displayed with entries . the bar is placed directly below the editing pane by default . by clicking on the sh@@ aded left side and pulling the toolbar can be moved to another location . &quot;
&quot; you probably did not set the command for voice output correctly or not fully . open Settings ... , open the General Settings page and enter the language output command on the voice output . ( see settings dialog for voice synthes@@ iz@@ ers for more details . ) &quot;
&quot; the festival is a language edition system from the University of Edinburgh . currently , only English , Spanish and Wal@@ is@@ isch are supported . the license allows to use the festival free of charge and without any restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival directory . &quot;
Free@@ T@@ TS is an in &amp; Java ; written language generator . currently it only supports the English pron@@ unciation .
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ et folder . the voice output is then possible with one of the following command examples : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option must be enabled as default input . ( this is the recommended example of Free@@ T@@ TS application . ) &quot;
&quot; MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the lyrics in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications . &quot;
&quot; in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax likes to swallow the last character of the text so that an additional character has to be added . therefore , the complete command is more complex than in the other examples : &quot;
( Cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; art@@ sp@@ lay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option to send data as default input must be enabled .
&quot; the voice output dem@@ on by &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language service , which provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice output systems . &quot;
&quot; since the setting of the language generator takes place only in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use frac@@ t@@ d as language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set . &quot;
&quot; to setup , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in the settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ mouth , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; needs about 15 MB of memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , but it depends on your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application that allows people who cannot speak , can output text by the computer . a list of already scann@@ ed sentences is stored , which the user can always make new editions . &quot;
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no speech synthes@@ izer is included . a speech synthes@@ izer must be installed on the computer .
you can find more detailed user documentation with help : / k@@ mouth ( either type this URL to the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; one or start k@@ help@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; - the voice @-@ output system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is a modules of existing service , which allows each application to read text about the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; is a sub @-@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; programmers , with which their applications can be equipped with T@@ TS skills . &quot;
read texts ( or parts thereof ) in text editor and posters ; even if &amp; posters ; embedded in other &amp; k@@ de ; applications .
&quot; speech output takes place via the program speech dispat@@ cher , which uses various background program such as e@@ Spe@@ ak , festival , &amp; etc . &quot;
allows the generation of voice output on the command line ( or shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; help program .
&quot; Z@@ U@@ K@@ UN@@ FT : support for Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up languages like Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Met@@ a @-@ Language ( SM@@ ML ) . &quot;
&quot; the voice output service of &amp; k@@ de ; , an application without visible windows that offers T@@ TS services via &amp; d@@ bus ; &quot;
an application with &amp; GUI ; for configuration and setup of kt@@ ts@@ d over kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the system section .
a module for the web browser &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a website or parts thereof .
a module for the text editor and posters ; with which a text file can be read completely or partially .
&quot; in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( htt@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you will find the list of htt@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ liche . the developers can also be found in the IR@@ C ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , channel # k@@ de @-@ liche ) . &quot;
&quot; before you can use it , you must install program speech dispat@@ cher and set it right . see also &quot;
&quot; at the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no actors have been set up , the card map is displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker installed , the card map General will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set up several variants for a synthes@@ izer . you should at least set up a speaker before using it ; otherwise the program speed dispat@@ cher is otherwise used by the default speaker . &quot;
different speakers for the same synthes@@ izer are comparable to several printer queu@@ es for the same printer .
&quot; when you click on the card @-@ card reader in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the card @-@ card reader is displayed . this will appear automatically when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up yet . &quot;
all speakers already equipped appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear on top of the list . the top speaker is used for voice output if an application does not present a speaker .
&quot; select a speaker from the list with a mouse click , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; select a speaker from the list with a mouse click , and click on this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; select a speaker from the list with a mouse click , and click on this button to push the speaker in the list one line further down . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority . &quot;
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the running &amp; t@@ ts ; system .
&quot; choose a voice type here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boys and girl &apos;s voice to choose from . &quot;
&quot; if you click here , the new speaker will appear on the board map . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit . &quot;
&quot; now you can use &amp; frac@@ ts ; almost to use . go back to the General tab and check whether voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled , so that the T@@ TS service starts . see . now you can use it ; to create and manage text messages . &quot;
&quot; if you have at least one speaker installed , you can start the language dispens@@ ing system from &amp; k@@ de ; click on the General tab to open this card . here you can set up some general options . &quot;
&quot; this starts the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the card card orders will be displayed and you can create and read text orders . see . remove the marking , will stop K@@ TT@@ SD and the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; de@@ activated . &quot;
&quot; when kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is terminated , it runs and t@@ ts ; further , if the field is activated ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is checked . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr appears automatically in the system area of the control bar , it disappears again once the reading is complete . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this row you can start , pause , pause and resume text orders . &quot;
with the buttons in this row you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; clip@@ board or open a text file for reading . you can also switch the speaker for an order .
&quot; click App@@ ly or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all sides . &quot;
&quot; the cart@@ on card orders are only displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click the General tab and check the voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed web page . first check the text that is to be read , and select the text read in the main menu . after a short time , the voice output should start . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a web page . you can also skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; he@@ aders and other invisible marks are also read . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read displayed text . first check the text that is to be read , and then select the text read in the main menu . then the voice output should start . &quot;
&quot; this also works if &amp; posted ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; &quot;
&quot; K@@ Noti@@ fy is the mess@@ aging system of &amp; k@@ de , which informs you about events you have set up . you can also read the text of these messages from &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can set up different types of messages . you can set up &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; for example , set up a message where your nick@@ name appears in an IR@@ C channel . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can then read the IR@@ C news text . &quot;
&quot; supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , a menu entry appears in the menu settings of this program . the here possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ depending on the application . &quot;
&quot; the k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml file is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by K@@ Mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as it can be assumed in most cases as provided . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of frac@@ t@@ ts ; for normal work with frac@@ t@@ ts ; filters are not required .
&quot; in Fil@@ ters , text is processed before it is sent to the program speech dispat@@ cher . they are useful for improving pron@@ unciation in order to replace un@@ spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , to select a suitable language and speaker , or to avoid certain short@@ com@@ ings of speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the functioning of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech dispat@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &quot;
&quot; the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the received orders will be resum@@ ed . &quot;
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is subject to hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will resume after the output of the warning .
&quot; news have the next highest priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you can read a long text on a website , you can come with &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone who is entering the room . &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ noti@@ fications are also messages . read more . &quot;
&quot; the rest are simple text orders . any job you shoot from the card card orders is a text order . K@@ Sa@@ y@@ it is an example of a application that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the output of long texts , which do not have any particular ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; all four types of job are processed in queu@@ es , with the exception of the output of screen readers . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one of these reads , this output is stopped and finished . &quot;
&quot; first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages . &quot;
&quot; filter edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently , there are three types of filters . &quot;
filters are designed as modules . in the future there can be further types of filters .
string replacement parts replace parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . it is supplied with pre@@ defined string replacement filters that allow replacing chat @-@ emoti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for format@@ ting messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understandable way .
&quot; XML ; reform@@ ers use a X@@ S@@ LT file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format to another format . in delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts , some X@@ S@@ LT files are included in the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML . &quot;
&quot; you can use speaker selection filters to send orders depending on the content of the text , or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; for example , if you have set a female voice on the card @-@ card reader , you can read text of K@@ DE messages about it . si@@ bi@@ e. read about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these different filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied for voice output . if the filter determines that its rules do not apply , it will pass the text unchanged to the next filter . &quot;
&quot; when a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the page . the processing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of normal filters installed . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and the following setup di@@ alogs are displayed . &quot;
&quot; for the creation of string replacement filters , you must enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison patterns . if these patterns are found in the text , then the text is exchanged for the corresponding replacement text . &quot;
&quot; enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name at any time , it only has to be distinguished from the names of the other filters . &quot;
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column agreement and replaces it in accordance with the string of the columns . the list is processed in the displayed sequence from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or the regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . download a list from a file , the entries from the file are attached to the existing list . &quot;
&quot; if a language is entered here , the filter will only be applied if the speaker speaks one of the languages listed here . click the button to view a list of languages . &quot;
&quot; if a value is entered here , the filter will only be applied if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
&quot; the application @-@ ID of running programs is available with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; d@@ bus ; numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example , and q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 indicates , you may only enter copied . &quot;
&quot; the string replacement filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen Filter if match . if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; when comparing words , the string replacement filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s. the words must be limited on both sides by separ@@ ators ( spaces ) . &quot;
&quot; in this manual you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 , for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the package node . &quot;
XML ; Trans@@ former translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ S@@ LT files from one format to another format . X@@ S@@ LT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W3@@ C standard for such modifications . but it can only be applied to well formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility needs to be installed on your system .
&quot; enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is reachable using the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c will suff@@ ice . &quot;
&quot; the speaker selection filter allows you to send texts to a certain speaker , who is set up on the card @-@ card speaker or to a speaker with specific features . for example , you can specify that texts should be read by a female voice by k@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; the speaker is selected based on the speaker characteristics , which pre@@ tends the program , which sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker sends , and the properties of the speaker appointed on the card card . with the speaker selection filter , you can over@@ write the selected speaker . &quot;
&quot; if a value is entered here , the filter will be applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can call it by clicking on the button to get help in entering . &quot;
&quot; to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; specify the properties of the speaker you want . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker will be selected to match the desired requirements . click the button on the right to display the dialogue selection dialog . &quot;
use these buttons to save or load your subscri@@ ber settings or delete all settings .
the speaker selection filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen Filter if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
&quot; the voice output API , from &amp; k@@ de ; , with which programmers can give their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD about &amp; d@@ bus ; . &quot;
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API can be added to K@@ TT@@ SD with the speech synthes@@ izer so that it &apos;s possible to use this synthes@@ izer .
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the voice output API of &amp; k@@ de ; . see the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( htt@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require voice output services via the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface from &amp; k@@ de ; from the kt@@ ts@@ d program to the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
&quot; text of the text for reading and an option is a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ; &quot;
there are even more commands you can use . for a list of all commands please enter
&quot; open two &amp; console windows . only start kt@@ ts@@ d in a window , then kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the other . &quot;
none of the mentioned speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers support my speech . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my language ?
&quot; I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; re@@ forming filter , but when using the module for festival web pages are not read out . &quot;
&quot; due to a mistake in festival 1.@@ 95 beta you have to install the ( male bri@@ tish ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone , so that S@@ able does not work at all . you have to do that even if you do not use this voice to read web pages . furthermore , make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and found on the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . &quot;
&quot; certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation characters appear to cause errors in the synthes@@ izer , so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or only ch@@ ewing @-@ cat@@ fish is spent . what can I do about it ? &quot;
&quot; first ensure that the character encoding option is set to the correct value for the appropriate language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , they may be fixed by a string replacement filter . &quot;

&quot; the language synthes@@ iz@@ ers used by &amp; kt@@ ts have their own license , which you can find in the related documentation or on the websites concerned . there are also voices that own a license . &quot;
&quot; if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can download the package with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can download it . you will also find the code of k@@ de@@ compos@@ ing under ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / . &quot;
&quot; contains many languages , a list of all currently supported languages can be found on the project page htt@@ p : / / es@@ pe@@ ak@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es.@@ html . &quot;
&quot; English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and Ibiza . &quot;
&quot; K@@ T@@ TS works with any speech synthes@@ izer , which can be started on the command line in a console . &quot;
&quot; the list of the above languages can be incomplete or outdated . therefore , consult the description of the synthes@@ izer to the supported languages . also check the kt@@ ts webpage ; , according to information which is not included in this manual . &quot;
&quot; the program &quot; &quot; speech dispat@@ cher &quot; &quot; uses an adap@@ table module architecture for voice synthes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand it for the use of another synthes@@ izer , contact the development team . &quot;
&quot; the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter , but is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . &quot;
&quot; to compile and convert , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including k@@ deli@@ bs and development files for the program &quot; speech dispat@@ cher . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you have downloaded the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source archive for k@@ de@@ compos@@ ing or have downloaded the tar@@ ball currently created each night , compile and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you use it , first check if speech dispat@@ cher is working properly with your speech synthes@@ izer . you can use the shell script of the SPD @-@ conf file . &quot;
&quot; frac@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of frac@@ t@@ ts used by speech dispat@@ chers . the kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr utility is to be developed in such a way , that the setup of speech dispat@@ chers is directly possible and the SPD @-@ conf script is no longer needed . &quot;
&quot; a long text is broken down into individual sentences . the user can leave sentences or sentences , repeat , stop or cancel the output . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and whose gender is female , it will be used , otherwise the best matching speaker will be chosen . if you want to learn more about how and kt@@ ts ; select a speaker , you will see in . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the Spe@@ aker tab on the Add @-@ in tab , and then click Edit or click Edit , the box map speaker setup will be displayed . as an example , the setup of the module for Festival Interactive will be shown below . details of the modules can be found below . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to festival is included in P@@ AT@@ H , you must enter only festival . &quot;
&quot; select the text encoding for text that is passed to festival . in case of voices that are known , this setting is automatically done . generally , Western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; this slider allows you to adjust the volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some regul@@ ators and display them in grey , the voice selected by you does not leave these settings . &quot;
&quot; some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need to be loaded several seconds due to their size . when you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so that ( with greater memory usage ) the first set is synthes@@ ized faster . &quot;
&quot; if this check box cannot be selected , you have not set up any speaker or click App@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected , t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will show the program window kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , only the kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr symbol in the system section is visible after the start , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to view the program window . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not yet run , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . thus , you have the option to stop reading or otherwise control . &quot;
&quot; here are all orders listed in the queue , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the currently edited sentence . &quot;
buttons in this row can be set or rec@@ alled in the order specified in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
&quot; with a click on OK , all changes in the settings ( also on the other card cards ) will be changed and t@@ t@@ m@@ gr will be reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to view the program window . &quot;
&quot; if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click the Audio card . see also . &quot;
&quot; text orders are performed and managed here . issues of screen readers , warnings and messages are not displayed . read more about the message types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in . &quot;
&quot; select here the type of audio output . if a component cannot be selected , it has been frac@@ t@@ ted ; either compiled or t@@ k@@ ts without support for the corresponding audio module ; cannot load the required libraries . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de for the audio output , select the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must install at least one module . if you have AL@@ SA selected , select the PC@@ M device . &quot;
&quot; set the talk speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % corresponds approximately half and 200@@ nbsp ; % about the double normal talk speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed . &quot;
click App@@ ly to take over the new settings for the running &amp; t@@ ts ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you have to find out which device works with you .
&quot; on this card card you can set up special actions , which are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of speech orders : &quot;
&quot; the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders . once the output of the screen reader has been read , the received orders will be resum@@ ed . &quot;
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is subject to hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will resume after reading the warning .
&quot; news have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks messages . if you want to read a long text on a website , you can with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless greet someone who is entering the room . &quot;

&quot; this audio file is always played when a normal text message is interrupted . if both recorded sound and introductory message are active , the introductory sound is played before the introductory message . &quot;

&quot; use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . if you click the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list . &quot;
&quot; this event reads the message , the &amp; conversation ; sends whenever someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an IR@@ C message . &quot;
&quot; all events , for which nothing else is stated in the list , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored . &quot;
use this drop @-@ down box to specify what &amp; t@@ ts ; do when an event arrives . you have the following choices :

&quot; you can enter the properties of the desired speaker here . standard sel@@ ects the speaker , which is displayed in the list on the card @-@ card speaker as the top entry . &quot;
&quot; note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a certain application , the action is executed for all other events of the particular application . otherwise , the action will be applied to all other events of the particular application . &quot;
the Event All noti@@ fications for the Application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this you can set the default noti@@ fications as follows :
&quot; use the Save button to save the settings for the noti@@ fications into a file . use the Lo@@ ad button to load saved settings from a file . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except All Noti@@ fications are deleted . &quot;
&quot; the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W3@@ C standard to highlight text for voice output . this standard contains trademarks for controlling voices , speech speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch . &quot;
currently supported &amp; t@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in the basic functions . the following restrictions exist :
&quot; you need to install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) , since this is the default voice , the festival is used in the issue of SS@@ ML . &quot;
&quot; if the setting for speed or sound in the Festival configuration dialog is not set to 100@@ ml ; % , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ous . &quot;

&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and pro@@ posi@@ tional filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds sub@@ divide text into individual sentences . this can start &amp; frac@@ ts ; faster with the read @-@ in , since only the first set can be synthes@@ ized or stop or stop , even if the speech synthes@@ izer does not directly support this . &quot;
&quot; here you can see the set @-@ up filters . at the first start of frac@@ t@@ ts , a set @-@ level detection filter is set up automatically . you can modify its settings or add additional set @-@ up filters , but beginners will get away from it . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to get to know the setup of the speaker selection by trying out . switch off the speaker selection and enter text to read . switch off the speaker selection , change some properties and check how the selection of the speaker is changed . of course , you have to set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; to start reading faster with the read , because only the first sentence must be processed and not the whole text block , which can take a long time , &quot;
&quot; you can then stop or cancel text orders on the card card , even if the speech synthes@@ izer does not support this function . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the normal set @-@ up filter is automatically set up when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only removed . do not change anything in this filter unless you know what you are doing . &quot;
text recognition filters compare text with a regular expression for by@@ laws and add a tab character ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to the set @-@ up boundaries ( tab characters are automatically removed from the text before the filter ) . note that the default set @-@ up filter retains the character set .
&quot; S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( flas@@ hers ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen readers . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the normal set @-@ up filter , you can paste it again by loading the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file contained in &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; on the card selection sel@@ ector , you can over@@ write the subscri@@ ber settings for the application . &quot;
use of the standard speaker ( the top of the card reader ) . in other words : no speaking abilities are specified .
&quot; use of the most appropriate subscri@@ ber that has all the features of an equipped speaker . if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker , select &amp; dict@@ ts ; otherwise select &amp; dict@@ ts ; the speaker who is most likely to comply with the originally set characteristics . &quot;
select the method to enter the desired subscri@@ ber properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
&quot; select the properties of the desired speaker here . if this property does not play a role , do not enter anything . &quot;
tick this check box if the property should have priority over other properties . you can also set several marks here .
&quot; because the language is a critical factor when publishing the output , it is always treated as a primary property . you will rarely use this feature . the only case you might want to specify the attribute language is above , if you know that a particular application will send text in another language than the one set in the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to use all the features in the field of spokes@@ persons who are most likely to er@@ ase the following , click on the Def@@ ault spokes@@ man and use on Spe@@ aker who is closest to the following . &quot;
&quot; in this case , 0 will be in queue for the last text order . you can also specify an order number . ( no order number is required 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; t@@ t@@ m@@ gr immediately crashes when it is started . I have compiled the Deb@@ u@@ g support , but I don &apos;t get any tracking . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is crash and frac@@ t@@ ts ; it was stopped . probably you have to register G@@ Stre@@ amer . if the problem is not solved by this , a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; the audio output via AL@@ SA doesn &apos;t work when I play music simultaneously with another application . if I receive a text message , it freezes and t@@ ts ; one . on the &amp; Con@@ sole ; appears a message that says : Un@@ able to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; there is a problem on your system that conflicts occur with AL@@ SA , which prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . you can find clu@@ es for possible solutions on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; I have uploaded an additional voice for festival from the internet . I have installed it and can use it in festival , but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not show this voice . &quot;
&quot; add $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tiv@@ al@@ int / voices in the file . as a guide , you can use the other entries . if this is successful , send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice , to the developers . &quot;
&quot; in order to do this , the program must be so@@ x installed and be discover@@ able via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . some syn@@ th@@ esi@@ ze modules such as Festival Interactive provide a setting for speed on the card interface . depending on the selected voice , it is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the talk speed are ignored when &amp; t@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; pre @-@ read . ( this is because the HTML is converted into SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for conversion of &amp; HTML ; to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite courageous , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ to @-@ SS@@ ML re@@ form@@ er@@ filter , and set up the speaking velocity . &quot;
I don &apos;t manage websites to be read with a female voice . I have set up a female festival speaker but &amp; k@@ ts ; reads the websites with a male voice .

&quot; I have added an own drawing filter replacement filter and now I am able to go back or forth in &amp; k@@ ts ; no more items are presented , the order consists only of one sentence . what am I doing wrong ? &quot;
&quot; you may not filter inter@@ pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks ( dot , question mark , ex@@ clamation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) . instead use a filter for set @-@ up detection instead . &quot;

&quot; some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts with the audio output . if your system is also included , you can not simultaneously play music and read a text . &amp; t@@ ts ; also freezes when you stop a text order and then start another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) . &quot;
&quot; as of July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de does not yet support real breaks . if you hold a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current sentence will be read yet . &quot;
&quot; the audio program so@@ x is used for the general setting of the speaking velocity , but is otherwise not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install so@@ x using apt @-@ get install so@@ x . the program is already included on most &amp; Linux ; CDs already included . &quot;
&quot; after downloading tar@@ ball ( with tar @-@ packed archive ) , login as a normal user and un@@ pack the tar@@ ball into a suitable folder . switch to this folder and enter the following commands : &quot;
in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 the module &amp; arts ; probably removed or at least only created on request .
the following modules for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers are created by default . some of them have a run@@ time dependence of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the guidelines of the Deb@@ ian distribution ) .
&quot; default ; in / opt / K@@ DE@@ 3 installed . if this folder is not listed in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you must specify as an option --@@ pre@@ fix = target . for example &quot;
&quot; on Deb@@ ian systems , / usr / local is the right folder for programs that are translated from the sources . &quot;
CD k@@ de@@ compression echo kt@@ ts@@ d &gt; in@@ st @-@ apps make -@@ f Mak@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ c@@ vs . / configure cd t@@ ts@@ d make su make install
&quot; before you use it , check first if your speech synthes@@ izer works properly . follow the instructions you received with the synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; the festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . &quot;
&quot; you must install at least one language . help can be found in the instructions provided with the festival . if you want to read web pages , you must install the ( male bri@@ tish ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on sharing . &quot;
&quot; this voice pres@@ upp@@ oses festival 1.@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ zip the software in festival / li@@ b / echo / r@@ ussi@@ an / . when you set up the Russian voices , you need to enter the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . select a Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding as for example ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
&quot; festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . so , look for the first one on the CDs of your distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding option must be set to an 8 @-@ bit Ky@@ ri@@ l@@ lic as for example ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
&quot; festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Synthes@@ izer . then , festival takes over the le@@ x@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from &quot;
please note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; not a complete language distribution system . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates voice from di@@ phon files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone . festival creates this by &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; required di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also be generated from German texts Di@@ phone . more information can be found here .
&quot; in this procedure , additional wra@@ pper code will be added to the festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices to voice synthesis . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice files are not installed in the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folder , but in the folder festival / li@@ b / . instructions can be found at &quot;
&quot; I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of festival for German &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices . required is either festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first , install festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then download the MS German Festival from &quot;
&quot; you will find instructions in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file in the package you have downloaded . ( for using with Festival 2.0 the recording of the error correction is not required , you only need to re@@ compile the festival ) . then add the following lines to the file festival / li@@ b / sit@@ ein@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m . &quot;
&quot; German Fem@@ ale , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 1 &quot; &quot; / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 2 &quot; &quot; German Fem@@ ale , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 2 &quot; &quot; / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 3 &quot; &quot; German Fem@@ ale , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 3 &quot; &quot; ) &quot;
&quot; on some systems you need to edit the file / etc / fes@@ tiv@@ al@@ .@@ sc@@ m . just add the lines for your installed German voices . replace the correct path in / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / . at the time of creating this manual , the German de@@ 4 , de@@ 5 , or de@@ votes do not work with I@@ MS German Festival . &quot;
this method uses special code to give the language over the festival with a Czech &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA . get and install first festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and make sure both work . then load Festival @-@ Czech from
un@@ zip the program with tar into a suitable folder and create the dictionary . the exec@@ utable file will have to be in your P@@ AT@@ H .

&quot; EP@@ OS is a free speech synthes@@ izer for Czech and Slovak language . it is a simple language synthes@@ izer with enough voice quality . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can adjust only the volume of this speech synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; click Add . select the Czech or Slovak language and epic T@@ TS language syn@@ ths . if the epic programs are not in your P@@ AT@@ H , enter the path to the programs on the card box . enter in a &amp; Con@@ sole ; epo@@ s -@@ h or say -@@ h to get more information . &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ oping speech synthes@@ izer written in &amp; Java , i.e. you need to install the &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . with &amp; Java , you can set neither pitch , volume nor speaking speed . &quot;
&quot; the command module allows you to use it ; any speech synthes@@ izer , which can be controlled in a console , can be controlled from the command line . &quot;
&quot; best use a command that writes the voice output to a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) , rather than sending the output directly to the audio device &quot;
&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allowing management of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a series of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf file has been developed to allow users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks :
&quot; after installation , a new module network settings are displayed in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the network settings module ( k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu . &quot;
&quot; it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; network hardware cannot be installed . physical devices and their drivers need to be installed and configured , so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices will be installed and set up . if network devices are added later , the drivers need to be loaded by custom@@ izing the following files according to the kernel version : &quot;
&quot; the Network Set@@ ting module is loaded when the Network Set@@ ting option is selected in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; when starting the module network settings , it tries to automatically detect the used platform on the system . &quot;
&quot; if the platform is not recognized , the hands @-@ on selection is offered . it is the platform to select from the list that best matches the distribution and the release date . by marking the setting of non @-@ recurring questions , the setting can be set permanently . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is only possible in system administrator mode . previously , all options are grey represented , which means the settings can only be viewed , changing is not possible . &quot;
&quot; in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three tab@@ s : &quot;
the Ri@@ der Network interfaces are used to manage network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed from the network interfaces tab :
the settings displayed on the network can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button &apos; button &apos; ... in the dialog box .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click Advanced Settings to show the dialog with further options . &quot;
&quot; in automatic mode , TCP / IP settings are done by a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . the D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at any system start , so no further setting is required . in the selective list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system . &quot;
&quot; the option Manual can be used without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP TCP / IP configuration . in the IP address input field , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface at boot . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be enabled . &quot;
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
&quot; it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked . &quot;
network devices can be activated or switched off as needed . switch on an switched network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface .
&quot; network devices can be activated or disabled , depending on your needs . disable an activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface . &quot;
specifies the IP address of the computer in the local sub@@ net which con@@ veys the physical link to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets .
&quot; if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface has to be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located . &quot;
&quot; a computer with DNS support replaces a full domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the host requests htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS triggers this name to an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
&quot; the name resolution calcul@@ ator will allow you to easily manage this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS records can be re @-@ ordered by selecting an entry or gra@@ ding in the list with the buttons Hin@@ ds or Her@@ under in priority . &quot;
by clicking the button Add ... from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution a DNS server can be added . it will display the New nam@@ eser@@ ver dialog .
first you must enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . then the entry will be inserted in the list .
&quot; from the group calcul@@ ator for name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button . the Edit dialog will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; the name @-@ known calcul@@ ator describes the host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address reference for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily when bo@@ oting , if there are no DNS servers available . in small , closed networks it can replace DNS servers . &quot;
&quot; usually , the list of name @-@ known hosts contains some entries , which support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . this still in the test version of IP should be replaced in future version 4 . &quot;
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known computer and click Add .... Add New Ali@@ as to appear .
&quot; enter the name of the familiar computer and click the Add button . if the familiar host has several alias names , press the Add button several times and enter the alias name . &quot;
select an entry from a name @-@ known machine from the list and select Edit .... Edit your acquainted computer will be displayed .
&quot; it can be executed one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts . &quot;
the settings made in the Network Set@@ ting module are not immediately effective in the system . to enable the changes must be set in a &amp; Con@@ sole ; the following command will be removed .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for installing the binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm packages ) it is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
installation of the finished compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a game console ; with rpm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a graphical interface like k@@ package or the installation tool of its distribution can be used . &quot;
&quot; for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; not , but in addition , the development packages with libraries and other tools are required . &quot;
&quot; this is recommended to experienced users only . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; the following commands should do this . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter important information about basic network technology is given , in the second all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; modi@@ fiable configuration files are discussed . &quot;
&quot; in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network will be provided . &quot;
IP networks are currently being operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 6 has never been widely used . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future . this description is currently focusing on the common IP@@ v@@ 4 .
&quot; one of the most important information is knowing which IP address is to be assigned to a network interface . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg , the network administrator is the contact person to use a valid IP address or , if available , D@@ H@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address cannot be simply chosen arbitr@@ arily ! &quot;
&quot; when setting up a small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet , so their use is possible . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be made possible by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways . &quot;
&quot; for smaller networks , addresses in the range of 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 are usually used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all computers are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ 15 ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own machine ) . the default route is required for IP forwarding . &quot;
&quot; the 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 network address is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address is 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 of its own lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle . &quot;

&amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; is an application that lets you run other programs after a schedule in the background . it is a graphical interface for the &amp; UNIX ; system program cr@@ on .
&quot; when starting at &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; you can see a list of already set tasks and related environmental variables . if you use &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; as root , this will appear for all users of the system as well as for system internal tasks . each folder can be opened and folded . &quot;
&quot; if a task is disabled , program name and parameters are not displayed and the description will be de@@ activated . &quot;
the environment variables that appear here do not use the otherwise existing environment variables for all listed tasks except power . if a de@@ activated variable appears as a description .
&quot; to create a new task , first select the tasks folder . then go to Edit New ... Altern@@ atively , you can also right @-@ click on the tasks folder and select New ... or press C@@ trl ; N in the pop @-@ up menu . &quot;
&quot; enter the name of the program to be star@@ ved . you can either specify a relative or an absolute path name . if you want to search the program first , press Select ... &quot;
select the minute ( s ) to which the task should be executed . with &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; you can specify the minutes in five steps .
&quot; if you select both Mon@@ thly Day ( s ) and week@@ day ( s ) , the task will be executed at a suitable date as well as on a suitable week@@ day . for example , if you select the 1st and 15th and Sunday , the program will be executed on the 1st and 15th of the selected months regardless of the day of the week , and also every Sunday of the month , no matter what date they fall . &quot;
&quot; as with the creation of new tasks , changes will only become active when the c@@ ron@@ tab was stored . &quot;
&quot; to cut out a task , first select the task to be removed . then go to Edit Cut . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can right click on the task and select Cut , or press C@@ trl ; X . &quot;
&quot; to copy a task , first select the task to be copied . then go to Edit copy . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can right @-@ click on the task and select Copy , or press C@@ trl + C . &quot;
&quot; in order to insert a task , first you have to cut or have been copied to the clip@@ board . only then , inser@@ ting is available at all . select the task folder . then go to Edi@@ ting In@@ sert . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can right click on the tasks folder and select past@@ ing , or press C@@ trl ; V . &quot;
&quot; to make changes to a job , first select one . then go to the Edit Change menu item . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , with the right mouse button click on the task and modify ... select , or you press C@@ trl ; O. It will then appear the dialog task in which you , as described above , can edit the selected task . &quot;
&quot; to delete a task , select the task to delete . then go to Edit Del@@ ete menu item . &quot;
&quot; to enable or disable a task , select them , and specify the state with the Edit Activ@@ ated menu item . in@@ active tasks are marked with In@@ active in their description . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can right @-@ click on the task and select Activ@@ ated . make sure that program name , parameter and description are displayed correctly . &quot;
&quot; to execute a task immediately , select it and then proceed to Edit Now . &quot;
&quot; to create a new environment variable , first select the variable folder . then go to Edit New ... &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can right click on the variable folder and select New ... or press C@@ trl ; N . &quot;
enter the name of the variable . you can also select a variable from the list of the most commonly used environment variables ; click the arrow next to the variable name field . these are :
to send e @-@ mails from the starting program to another as the normal address
&quot; as with the creation of new variables , changes will only be made when the c@@ ron@@ tab was saved . &quot;
&quot; to cut a variable , first select the variable to be removed . then go to Edit Cut . &quot;
&quot; to copy an environment variable , first select the variable to be copied . then go to Edit copy . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can right click on the variable and select Copy , or press C@@ trl + C . &quot;
&quot; to add an environment variable , first you have to cut or have been copied to the clip@@ board . first , the option In@@ sert is available at all . select the variable folder . then go to Edi@@ ting In@@ sert . &quot;
&quot; to change a variable , first select the variable to edit . then go to Edit Change ... Altern@@ atively , you can right @-@ click on the variable and modify ... select , or you press C@@ trl ; O . then you can edit the dialog , in which you can edit the variable as described above . &quot;
&quot; to delete an environment variable , first select the variable . then go to Edit Del@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; to enable or de@@ activate an environment variable , select it and specify the state with the Edit activated menu item . if a de@@ activated variable appears , Description : &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can right @-@ click on the variable and select Activ@@ ated . make sure the name and value of the variables are displayed correctly . &quot;
&quot; if all tasks and environment variables have been entered or changed , you still need to save the c@@ ron@@ tab . to do this , select File Save . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can press C@@ trl + S . changes or additions to tasks or variables will only be activated . &quot;
&quot; it appears the default k@@ de ; -@@ Print dialog . if you choose to fold out , you will see that there are two additional &amp; k@@ ron@@ on ; -@@ specific options in the dialog . &quot;
print the c@@ ron@@ tab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible to users who have advanced permissions .
&quot; cr@@ on , for example , Vi@@ x@@ ie @-@ cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses the c@@ ron@@ tab command to change the time schedule of the users . &quot;
&quot; a PO@@ SIX compliant &amp; UNIX , for example gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands of &amp; UNIX to learn time and date . &quot;
&quot; and dat ; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar . it offers the possibility to store several archives on a tape . the first objective was to create a surface for tar , which provided the capability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for quick , selective un@@ packing . the second goal was to answer a question that my wife asked : how much longer does it take if you secure ? &quot;
&quot; before a tape can be used , it must be incorporated by &amp; k@@ dat ; it can be done in three ways : &quot;
&quot; dat ; how@@ l the band back and read the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the tape . if you don &apos;t know the band , you &apos;ll be asked if the tape is to be format@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; detects &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre @-@ set , searches for the right index on your disk . if this is not found , you &apos;ll be asked if the band index is to be recre@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; if everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape was integrated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the volume of the tape can now be searched for the volume by folding the entry . &quot;
&quot; before throwing the tape , the integration needs to be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this : &quot;
&quot; by changing the symbol for the tape , there is a change of the symbol for the band that the integration for the band has been solved and displays a corresponding message in the status bar . the tape can now be ej@@ ected without danger . &quot;
&quot; before a tape by &amp; dat ; can be used , it must be format@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; a band type must be format@@ ted before you can be used to store data . if your tape drive requires format@@ ting before use , this must happen before you can format it . flo@@ ppy tape drives usually require a format@@ ting of the tape , DA@@ T drives do not . &quot;
&quot; after entering the band name and the capacity drives &amp; k@@ dat , continue with the tape format@@ ting . all data on the tape will be lost ! after completion of the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and ready for use . &quot;
&quot; before you start the backup process , you need to select the files to be secured . this can happen in three ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder will be backed up .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are backed up .
right click on the local file tree and select Save ...
&quot; once the backup has been started , the dialog will open for backup . in this dialog you can review the selected files and change the settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it will only check the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives in the record for the tape with a check box . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right click in one of the archives and select the menu entry ...
&quot; once the test procedure has been started , the dialog will appear for checking . in this dialog you can review your selection and change the working folder for checking . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for checking , the dialog will appear . this dialog shows the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining . &quot;
&quot; before you can initiate re@@ producing , the files that are to be recovered must be selected . this can be done in two ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive . it will only be restored to the selected file or the sub@@ folder .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore in the Rest@@ ore menu ....
&quot; once the restore process has been started , the dialog for Rest@@ ore appears . in this dialog you can review your selection and change the working folder for recovery . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the restore settings , the dialog will appear . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining . &quot;
sometimes it turns out to be necessary to recre@@ ate the band index file using the band content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this volume . you can create the index in two types of the volume :
this creates a safety profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder in which the backup should take place . the list of files to be saved will be automatically updated according to the currently selected working folder .
&quot; for all the files listed under backup files , only the files located in the same file system will be backed up as the folder . folders that are located on other file systems can be stored separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar independent of the others . &quot;
&quot; to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then are backed up . &quot;
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delete the snapshot file before the tar call . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; lt ; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set up the settings using the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ winding version of the tape machine .
&quot; this setting is active , transmitted and dat ; before the tape is inserted , the load is loaded to the drive . for some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed . &quot;
&quot; if the option is turned on , try to lock the tape drive . maybe this setting does not work on all tape drives . &quot;
&quot; if the option is turned on , the tape will be dis@@ car@@ ded ; the tape will be dis@@ car@@ ded automatically . do not use this option at Flo@@ ppy Stre@@ am@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you need to report the block size for your tape drive . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; dat ; a tape format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only cover one memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are composed as follows : &quot;
&quot; ( n Byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is the host@@ name : seconds , where the host@@ name is the full name of the system on which the tape was format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the period in which the tape was format@@ ted . &quot;
the band ID is used to find a file named in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
&quot; the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not about incre@@ mental back@@ ups . &quot;
check the contents of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a tape is integrated .
&quot; the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system , or where the system stores the different protocol files . in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system stores the different protocol files .
&quot; in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log allows experienced users quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore , tries to provide some advanced features that can be filtered and analysed using the protocol files of certain programs . &quot;
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
&quot; support for many different types of log files , for the format of the sy@@ slo@@ g server and Sam@@ ba &quot;
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you can see in the following screen@@ shot , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions are available to easily filter and sort the individual protocol lines of a log file . the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering will be shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after startup , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first try to open the main protocol file of the system - the system log - will not show you , and it opens up instead of a small message window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; very likely not to have permission to read under Linux in the / var / log file , for the normal user typically . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar to filter by a selected criterion or entered string . in the default setting , the selection box next to the filter will display the entry All . then a log line will be displayed next to the filter . then a log line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is contained in one of the columns . &quot;
&quot; you can of course select another entry at this point . for example , in the protocol file system protocol , select the column process , and also enter the name of a process in the filter bar , so you will see &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all log lines that were sent or created by this process . &quot;
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol rows . protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a more eye @-@ catching color than protocol lines of the level indicator . the colored representation of protocol rows can be switched on setup dialog .
&quot; if you want to display only a certain process ( e.g. in the system log or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( PID ) in the process column . for example , this can be useful if you want to examine the output of a certain command such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bar . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can activate the option To create new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all new incoming protocol rows . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows you to view multiple log files in separate sub @-@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on htt@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you will find more current information about the sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; you will also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; archive
&quot; welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , more known ( and named in the following ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; This section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the V In@@ it system is rapidly becoming the standard for controlling the program starts when starting the system in the &amp; Linux ; world . it is because it is easier to use , more powerful , and more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it . &quot;
I will not go further into historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
&quot; the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone might try to change a machine on System V in@@ it without re@@ installing and re@@ format@@ ting it . the &amp; Linux kernel first looks under / etc after an in@@ it file . therefore , you need to make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one . &quot;
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD in@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c@@ .d@@ . D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders :
&quot; system services do not include such things like network , NFS , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , ht@@ tp@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is started only once . such calls are r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; for your part , r@@ c.@@ local should be in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . you can also create a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port . &quot;
the kernel searches in different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one that it finds .
the default run@@ level is entered in / etc / init@@ tab . you should see a line like the following :
&quot; at this point you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default running level 3 is . if you want to change this , then you can edit / etc / init@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . if you have mess@@ ed up , then you can fix it by re@@ boot the system and run the following : &quot;
&quot; but how does it start all the correct scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following : &quot;
&quot; you will notice that there are no right files in this folder . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the init@@ .@@ d directory . &quot;
how does and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop . you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line :
&quot; this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if a K contains , the script will be called with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script will be called with the argument start . &quot;
&quot; some people wish to set up a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could have a server @-@ running level which can run only ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc . in addition , I could also have a user @-@ running level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , Network &amp; etc . &quot;
here you will learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another pointing device is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six running levels to start ( or stop ) at this level .
you can also move scripts between Run@@ modes or change the position within a level by moving it elsewhere . this will not happen if you pull out an entry from the range of available system services .
&quot; note : entries are moved when you move them into a new area . to only copy them to a new running level , you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert them in the target area -- even if the same entry already existed in the target area of the action . &quot;
&quot; the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you must edit the sorting numbers of the resulting entries before you can try again to insert the system service . &quot;
&quot; note : currently , there is no way to restore entries that were thrown into the tr@@ ash . so be careful . &quot;
&quot; you can use the Tab@@ ul@@ ator button to activate the different working areas ( available system services , run@@ level 1 start , run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one . &quot;
&quot; to move one entry to another run@@ level , move it into the clip@@ board by cutting into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and insert it into the desired run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ trl ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually , press the input button to change the Properties dialog . use the Tab key to change between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed . &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are removed from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise they will be recovered by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
&quot; I experim@@ ented with the standard running level@@ ers , and now the machine is rest@@ art@@ ing constantly . what can I do ? &quot;
enter the LI@@ LO prompt lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single user mode . then edit the / etc / init@@ tab file and change the default level to a reasonable value ( 3 should usually be fine ) .
&quot; I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for running under run@@ level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( DL@@ D ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual . &quot;
&quot; the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions facilitates the configuration of the proprietary set @-@ up programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you are using another distribution , please check that all configuration files are present ( and whether they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as eg ; Apache or ht@@ tp@@ d ) simply quit without a message , if their configuration files are not present or in@@ correctly set up . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; running level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use any other distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level so that they can be added to this manual . &quot;
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
&quot; to begin with &amp; k@@ user ; to begin , it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read . &quot;
&quot; after you &apos;ve made changes , you need to save it . either use the corresponding toolbar icon or entry in the File menu . &quot;
&quot; the main window consists of two cards , the user and the user group list . to edit , select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry . &quot;
&quot; some card @-@ cards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings . only if you have enabled space restrictions ( quot@@ a ) for users , a card card is generated that you can make individual settings . other card cards appear , if shadow passwords or , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as installed in BSD Uni@@ xes . &quot;
&quot; the card pass password management appears , if shadow passwords or , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d like in BSD Uni@@ xes are installed . &quot;
&quot; this card card only appears if it is enabled and initi@@ alized for at least one @-@ bound file system constra@@ int ( quot@@ a ) and initi@@ alized ( recognizable by the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here , parameters can be changed for each user . &quot;
these parameters can be individually set for each file system . the current fil@@ esystem is selected using the field file system with limited space limitation .
&quot; the group , to which the user belongs , can be found in the Prim@@ ary Group field . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field . &quot;
&quot; the Di@@ alogue properties of the group contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or group , select Add from the Users or Group menu or click the appropriate Add button of the toolbar . editing or Del@@ ete the selected user or group works analogue . &quot;
&quot; with this module you can install the LI@@ LO system manager , add , remove and change the boot password , change the time up to boot of the default operating system , add the default operating system , remove , change operating systems , remove , change , and more . &quot;
