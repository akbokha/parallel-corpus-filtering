<seg id="5">"package & package; contains different modules for & konqueror; despite their small size, they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of & konqueror; by making them easier to access."</seg>
<seg id="6">More information about the use of & konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the manual to & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="7">"to load these modules in & konqueror, select Settings add-ons.... Open the card card tools and select the desired modules."</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of standard setup modules from the kde; addons. please note that maybe more modules are on your system if you have additional software installed.</seg>
<seg id="9">"you should install the kdebase package, which & konqueror; contains before you compile this package."</seg>

<seg id="12">"to use DOM tree view in & konqueror; select Extras DOM tree... and open a new window with DOM of the currently displayed web page. as default, the display starts with the root node of the document, for example: documentelements, all other nodes are sub-elements of this root node."</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; provides a further view of objects with the MIME type inode / directory on local files. it can be used as an alternative to the various symbol and text views in order to view the contents of your local filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the special feature of & FSView is to graphically display nested folders hierarchies with the help of a so-called tree map. each object is represented by a rectangle whose surface is proportional to its size. this size must have the property, that the sum of the sizes of the child objects is smaller or equal to the size of the object."</seg>
<seg id="15">"for & FSView; the size of a file or folder shows the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries in it. in this way, large files can be easily recognized when they are far down in the folder hierarchy. therefore, & FSView; as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX command you can be considered."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in & FSView; an entry in the Treemap representation is a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your file system. for easier navigation, the rectangles have meaningful color and labelling settings."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the color of a rectangle that is switched over view color mode can represent either depth for the easy detection of the nesting depth or the illustration of another file property, such as name, owner, group or MIME type."</seg>
<seg id="18">"a rectangle can be labeled with the various properties of the corresponding file or folder. for each feature, you can specify whether it is displayed at all, only if there is enough space to display or if the area of child-related rectangles should be used (whereby the display error may be caused by restrictions in the character of the Treemap). furthermore, you can set the relative position of the caption in the rectangle."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the case of representation algorithms for treemaps, the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. in the Treemap in & FSView, this goal is not always respected."</seg>
<seg id="20">"the allocation of the area of an entry for the subordinate entries remains up to the implementation. in this case it is easy to divide the areas in such a way that rectangles are created, which are as square as possible. the best methods in this regard are lines, columns or recursive divisions."</seg>
<seg id="21">"you can set the minimally displayed area for an entry on the menu entry View Viewing of Area. instead, a space pattern is drawn into the area of the superior entry in order to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry."</seg>

<seg id="62">You can also visit the digicam; homepage to see news about released versions and other information about & digikam; to learn.</seg>
<seg id="63">"the best start to participate in & digikam; to participate, is the registration in the developer mailing list. instructions for announcing in the developer mailing list of & digikam;."</seg>
<seg id="64">"when you launch & digikam; for the first time you'll be asked where you want to save your pictures and your database. you can specify a local, remote or removable folder. simply enter the path name or click the Folder icon to select a folder."</seg>
<seg id="65">"in the second field you have to specify a local folder on your computer. here, the data abnk will be saved. this path remains the same for all folders."</seg>
<seg id="66">"later you can add as many folders as you want. & digikam, you will additionally use as an Albenlibrary."</seg>
<seg id="67">"if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk, you can specify the top folder that contains pictures, as base folder. & digikam; viewed any subfolder as an album. no image will be changed."</seg>
<seg id="68">You cannot exclude sub-folders unless it is in hidden folder. you can do this by inserting a dot in front of the name of the subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="69">"if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My Albenliste do not have photos as symbols. you can change them by taking any photo from the album and using it on the folder symbol."</seg>
<seg id="70">"once you have configured the base folder, you can set up & digikam; set up your digital camera. after that, you should learn how to use My Albums and My keyworths to manage your photos in the albums."</seg>
<seg id="71">"raw file support: if you are using the raw mode of your camera, you can use it. the support is based on the libraw library. if you want to figure out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported routers in the Help channel support menu."</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Roh-DecoderSettings and Roh workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">"an easy-to-use camera interface will be provided to you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digikam. more than 1,000 digital cameras are supported by the library gphoto2. of course, every media and card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digikam."</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. the camera is then used as a disk drive. the connection can also be realized via Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may connect the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">"gPhoto2 is a free, distributed software collection for digital cameras that supports an ever increasing number of more than 800 cameras. gPhoto2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol, a widespread protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers."</seg>
<seg id="76">"many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer. since photos are generally large files and transfer over the serial port is slow, this connection is now obsolete. & digikam; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link."</seg>
<seg id="77">"libgphoto2 has to be created with libexif support to reliably read the preview images of digitiam. if the if support is not present in libgphoto2, you may not see thumbnails or the generation could be very slow."</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things in & digikam; is how easy its functionality can be extended by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">"KIPI modules: the KDE image plugins Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digikam;, KPhotoAlbum, Shovmg and Gwenview. the goal is to provide modules to all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section."</seg>
<seg id="80">"modules can manipulate images in virtually any way as a user can. their advantage is that it is much simpler, & digikam; by writing a small module to complement one function, as the changes in & digikam; even carry out."</seg>
<seg id="81">"to simplify the window, you can either remove pages with & LMB; remove or switch to full-screen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F."</seg>
<seg id="82">"moving and dropping images works everywhere: you can store an image in another part of the Albenedim, via the horizontal line of partition or to another application window. the only restriction is that one image cannot be stored in keywords, date list or search."</seg>
<seg id="83">"- a file type selection allows you to differentiate the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, Movies and Audio"</seg>
<seg id="84">"the text filter will only be used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view. thus, the filter will work on the filename only if it is displayed in the symbol view. which fields are displayed you can configure in the dialog of the AlbenSettings."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the view & quot; My Albenlistequot; provides an organized view to your photo albums. all photos stored by & digikam are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted by the folders where they were created on the hard disk, after the name of their collection in the albendy properties or after the date the album was first created."</seg>
<seg id="86">"if you have set up a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. you can also select an album to scan images. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album."</seg>
<seg id="87">"to copy or move an image from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it down. in the then appearing menu you will need to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. you can also move or copy several photos in the same way. simply select all photos and move them to the target album."</seg>
<seg id="88">"an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to input information about this collection. to access the album features, right click on the album and select the album title menu in the context menu."</seg>
<seg id="89">"album collections: are a method to mark your albums so that you can group under a common name. the collection used by you will be used to sort your photos, when you choose to add or delete new collections. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do this in the settings for collections."</seg>
<seg id="90">The album date: is used when you sort your albums by date with viewing albums by date sort.</seg>
<seg id="91">"buttons eldest, average, new testers: these put the date on that of the oldest, the latest image or average of the album. to do this, first attempts to calculate the average of the images from their EXIF information. if this fails, instead the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder."</seg>
<seg id="92">"when you first created an album in & digikam, the first picture in the album will be selected as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlistequot; this will help you to remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you may want to select another photo as a symbol."</seg>
<seg id="93">"to select another photo as an album icon, click the right mouse button and select" "Default" "in the pop-up menu. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol."</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can only be contained in a collection and collections cannot be nested.</seg>
<seg id="95">The collection includes all photos of the album. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">"the image window provides you with the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all images are displayed in this album in the image window. each photo is displayed in a preview, you can customize the size of these preview with the two magnifying buttons in the toolbar."</seg>
<seg id="97">"when you open an album for the first time, you have to wait short while the thumbnails are generated. you can avoid this by regenerating all thumbnails in the Extras menu."</seg>
<seg id="98">"information about each image is displayed below the corresponding preview. what information is, you can change settings digikam; set up the albums page and adjust the preview pane to suit your preferences."</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails have help window that appear. the help displays the most important features including all the tags of a photo. the screenshot above in the introduction to the main window displays such an help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">"albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you. image editing displays your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to them. you can choose between viewing the images, a slide show or editing pictures."</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the image editing with a photo by using either F4 image editing... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and Edit... select. in the digikam; image editing you can see a tutorial on how to edit your photos.</seg>
<seg id="102">"it can happen that & digikam; the functionality you need is not available. you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the submenu of opening. to do so, and how to customize it to your needs, if your program is not listed, you will find information in & kde; manual."</seg>
<seg id="103">"some programs do not store this data when you save the changed image. thus, this information is lost from EXIF and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture etc."</seg>
<seg id="104">& digikam; provides two options for rotation. the easiest way is to click on the thumbnail to preview and rotate it. in the submenu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>

<seg id="152">"professional photographers have other requirements, such as versioning of photos, archiving, workflows, constant supply of images to different topics and a large number of all. within 10 years 95% of archives and 5% working files will have and you will then not want to reorganize your structure for this content."</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier. separate new old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived image.</seg>
<seg id="155">"we also recommend the metadata option in the creation page of the metadata in & digikam; to activate. this ensures that EXIF and IPTC data are written into the file. if you forget this, you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album menu."</seg>
<seg id="156">"now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change them? add & digikam; they provide a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important ones."</seg>
<seg id="157">"of course you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value. this makes sense, as you can focus on the best photos when working."</seg>

<seg id="189">"while most electric devices do not matter too much, the devices with computer chips and high speed processors are different. these can cause serious damage. thus, these anomalies can cause serious shortcuts, complete data loss, hardware aging, destroyed motherboards and other defects."</seg>
<seg id="190">"the most widespread protection against power peaks is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs part of the energy heat and grooves the rest. it is usually available in the form of a plug-in connector, but remember that not every connector bar also contains an overvoltage protection."</seg>
<seg id="191">"if you are looking for an overvoltage protection, you should make sure that it meets the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection."</seg>
<seg id="192">"since an overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected. this also applies to telephone lines and cable modems as well as a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modem and the TV card."</seg>
<seg id="193">"if you have a notebook, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are especially developed for notebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem. this makes you ideal for on the go."</seg>
<seg id="194">"while an overvoltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines, it won't really help you with a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be useful to invest in a break-free power supply."</seg>
<seg id="195">"besides the protection against voltages, these devices can automatically provide cordless power when a power failure occurs. this gives you the possibility to save your data and run down the system. if you buy a USV then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. in addition, the lifetime of the battery and the enclosed software is interesting."</seg>

<seg id="199">"the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images. this is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution."</seg>
<seg id="200">"Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are available on photos. your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want your pictures in full resolution online."</seg>

<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer. all transfers are prone to transmission errors. the file system ZFS and btrfs ensure at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">"the worst thing is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred, not if it happened in your hardware. all of these disturbances remain undetected until you one day you open a photo and this to your surprise is destroyed. it is quite disturbing that there is no protection in your computer. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data route than that in your computer."</seg>
<seg id="204">"unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses, because they generate interferences in data streams. in normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed."</seg>
<seg id="205">"even if you are not affected by transmission problems at the moment, you should look into the future. already in 2010 you will see thousands of faults per year."</seg>
<seg id="206">"ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle disk errors on a low level and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it will soon be available for Linux and Windows. read this article in English."</seg>

<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. creates multiple snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup was made. this backup comes with a versioning system the next with the exception that it is only aborted and not continuous.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts rsync only copies the difference of files that were really changed. this is compressed and if you want to increase security over ssh.</seg>

<seg id="227">"so that valuable pictures survive the next 40 year that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:"</seg>
<seg id="228">"since the future is unpredictable due to your nature, you have to consider everything that is said today with caution and re-evaluate while time passes. unfortunately, you should ask yourself how the current system is backward. the less variants you have used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future."</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document. use or change to open standards supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">"virtualization is available for everyone today. so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures, then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use."</seg>
<seg id="231">"on the other hand, the council is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your memory and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards."</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the professional expression for the possibility to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>

<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary patented format that slowly disappears from the market. so you should not use it any more.</seg>
<seg id="238">"PNG is a lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16 bits per color channel and full transparency. PNG can store gamma- and chromaticity data for improved colour allocation for heterogeneous platforms. the disadvantage is that there are relative many administrative information, but not as many as TIFF and has a slow compression."</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF is widely used as image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with lossless compression algorithm (Deflate). it manages images in high quality but requires very large files.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative file format is a license-free and open-format image format developed by Adobe Systems. DNG is developed on the TIFF / EP format and is obliged to use metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers now provide DNG and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon can use it at some point.</seg>
<seg id="241">"this is possibly one of the reasons why, around 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML based XMP technology to replace the & quot; image resource blockage; XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platforms quot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. the file information is stored with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; which stands for XML / RDF."</seg>
<seg id="242">"many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording, mostly in the raw format. XMP fits because it stores the metadata separately from the image file. however, it can cause problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file and as mentioned above, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put it all together."</seg>
<seg id="243">"the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization that supports fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models.

<seg id="302">"if this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used."</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white balance is not set. standard is a fixed color balance based on a white card photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images get more details in four steps. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>

<seg id="306">"this is possible because blue pixels are generally not as fast as green and red. & digikam; and dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions from the still unsaturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question of how much color or white you want."</seg>
<seg id="307">"if you select the reconstruct option, you get the option to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each picture."</seg>
<seg id="308">"set the luminance value according to your taste. you probably have to set it slightly higher than the standard 1. however, this can also be done later in the image options of the & digikam; image processing. to keep the time for the demosaicing small, you should proceed conservatively."</seg>
<seg id="309">"a demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the partial raw data that many cameras have, and which provides a matrix of color pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or color reconstruction."</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections which can improve a picture in most cases. therefore use it before attempting any further manual editing.</seg>
<seg id="389">"the functions normalize, matching, automatic matching and contrast extend from the Corrigible Automatic correction menu try to automatically make the most of your colors. you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo."</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scales the luminaire values over the entire image so that the darkest point is black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or full-washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">"similar: this method adjusts the brightness of the color of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible. sometimes the result achieves very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it also produces trash. it is a very powerful operation which either causes miracles in an image or it destroys it."</seg>
<seg id="392">"automatic adjustment: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel. it detects the dark and light boundary tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram range."</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method enhances the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the widest possible range and a new jib of all values in between. this is only visible in full-washed pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">"the white balance correction is slightly limited because a color space with 8 bits per color is worked. if you are able to run too far from the original image, areas with overexposure may occur. if you can do the white balance in raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction will be better."</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is copyrighted by Pawel T. Jochym. you start it via the menu entry color white balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">"the preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left side, both the original image and the preview of the target image can be seen. the preview is dynamically adapted to the settings of the tool."</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red marker. the pixel of the pixel under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">"at the top right, a histogram shows that dynamically changed once you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit images, most pixels very small luminance values. with one button, you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum will be displayed. the sum is called Luminance."</seg>
<seg id="400">"the contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. the shadow adjustment lets you improve or dimming the shadow details of your photos."</seg>
<seg id="401">"to play anstat with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance. in this way, the temperature and green values are set automatically."</seg>
<seg id="402">"in addition, you can set the white balance with the list of default settings. the following settings are available:"</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixels is overexposed.. You will get the combined result displayed in the white balance. this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The Save As and Load buttons do exactly this. each setting of the white balance you have set can save you to a text file and reload later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The preset button sets all the filter values back to their default values and the associated neutral white balance. note that even neutral settings will result in another photograph as your original. if you save it your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">"you can set the encoding depth per color channel of the processed image here. 8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better for high quality images. however, this coding needs more disk space, computing time and is only available for PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG formats."</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as used for the processing of color profiles. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color mapping can be done through the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed guide for using color profiles allows you to consult the chapter Color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">"this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously, allowing you to use them for multiple photos. this is helpful if your camera or scanner always make the same mistake and you will always need the same correction."</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility to correct exposure issues is the tool for gradation that you can find in colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">"the & digikam; tool color effects provide you with four color effects, a solar installation effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter."</seg>
<seg id="411">"in times of chemical processing, Solarisation, also called Sabatier, was an effect of the photopaper from the additional light. this had the effect that the lighter areas darker and the colors were inverted by the second illumination. the result was a partial negativity of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine."</seg>
<seg id="412">"the intensity controls the solar polarization. at approx. 50% intensity, the picture shows what is chemically possible. a further increase ultimately creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photographic paper."</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar installation effect. the original image is the (1) and the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation by making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it simply to embellish many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an inverse color film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth texture. Velvia offers highly saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="416">"the neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repetitions the strength of the neon light. for large images, the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment."</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not uncommon to correct the color contrast and luminosity of the photos. you can experiment with the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors.</seg>
<seg id="418">"also in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation rather than increase it. all changes you can perform can be viewed in the preview. if you like the result, you can confirm the changes with Ok."</seg>
<seg id="419">"between the complex tool Gradation and the simple luminous / contrast / gamma the tool is set to improve the exposure. even if the dialog with this tool works very complicated, you only need the area of the sliders for the purpose intended here. concrete the three sliders below the histogram."</seg>

<seg id="479">& digikam; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">"sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but creates, especially in dark areas, grainy images."</seg>
<seg id="481">"the sharpness mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture sharper. in fact, it does not sharpen a bit, it works rather psychosocial. you can use it to remove atmospheric vapor and it makes a really good job. the algorithm has been taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang."</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is possibly the best of the three since it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="483">"images without focus as well as most digitised images need a correction of the sharpness. this is because the digitization process must be summarized with only minimal differences to a colour point. therefore, the same phenomenon can be observed when colour points are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally require more retrosharpening than normal cameras for private users."</seg>
<seg id="484">"in JPEG pictures, a camera is often applied to internal sharpness. images in the raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanners turn a field filter while reading the image. if you disable it, you will get control of your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">"in some situations, you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpness of the sharpness. you can use the menu entry to apply correcting the sharpness."</seg>
<seg id="487">"you should deal with caution because the results do not work very naturally: the sharpness increases the sharpness of the edges, but also amplifies noise. generally, the most suitable technique is to refocus the sharpness of an image. you can refocus further information and a comparison of all techniques to focus."</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to draw the image a little soft is much easier than to sharpen. use the tool for soft sign with the menu entry of correcting softeners and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unsharp masking is a very good tool to remove slime from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview help to edit the image. the preview window shows the filter output with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the standard values often generate good results and should be tried first. if you make the sharpness mask too strong, noise and the impression of grates will produce close to sharp edges."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii.</seg>
<seg id="493">"the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred image, which is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set."</seg>
<seg id="494">"the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applying difference amount. thus, you can define a minimal difference with that for an edge of the filter. thus, areas with a soft change between the sounds are exempt from sharper and hence, beauty errors in faces, skies and water surfaces are avoided."</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example of the unsharp masking filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image is applied (2). unsharp masking was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digikam; tool refocused refocuses a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyright-protected escaping filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is a better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filtering. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a blurry mask. refocus mostly results better results as vague masking. you can start it from the menu by refocusing on colors in image editing.</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice the circular folding works much better than the Gauss's folding. the Gauss's folding has a very long tail, which results in the mathematical result also from the source pixies that are far from the original source pixel."</seg>
<seg id="499">"this is the most important parameter for using this module. for most images, the default value should result 1 good results."</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help to reduce artifacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and values close to 1; eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for correlation reduces the sharpness effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">"filter can take values of 0-1. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, the image quality is very bad. a usable value is 0,03. a high value will continue to smear the image even further."</seg>
<seg id="502">"Gauss's sharpness: this is the radius for the palate 'sharpness. use this parameter if your sharpness is Gauß' sch. in most cases, you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you use a value non-zero, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">"this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the size of the die can produce good results, especially if you select large values for this parameter. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocused parameter you have set will be stored for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">"try to perform all trimming, color and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise you should use the module before changing the image otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations that are not visible immediately, but later leave unpleasant artefacts."</seg>
<seg id="507">"when you read and compress images, eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image."</seg>
<seg id="508">"in general, imsharp masks produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by the blurry masking a larger neighborhood than sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="509">"theoretically, imsharp masks must always create artefacts. even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of blurred. for the Viennese filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal Lineare filter. practically, the result of the FIR Wiener Filters is always as good as the sharpness mask. the FIR Wiener Filter is often better in processing small details."</seg>
<seg id="510">"below you can see a comparison between the different filters, applied on a small unfocused image:"</seg>
<seg id="511">This image has been made with an analog camera. the unfocussed result is due to insufficiently light for the car focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the sharpness correction methods in digital pictures you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The regulators smoothen the sharpness of the area that has been darkened to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">"the ink ink enables a customized colour for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, you can adjust it here."</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most developed tools to remove unwanted artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various default settings as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available default settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">"if you want to adjust the filter settings fine, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings."</seg>
<seg id="519">"detail conservation p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to a uniform smoothing over the image. a value of 0.9 should be maintained in such a way that no sharpening is necessary afterwards. note that the detail-keeping should always be subordinated to the direction of direction."</seg>
<seg id="520">"alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions while a value close to 1 is only smoothed in one direction. if you have a film graining or CCD noise will produce a high value wave-like pattern. JPEG artifacts are best removed with a value near 1."</seg>
<seg id="521">"smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above allit. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore set this value to the degree of noise in your image."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothed. this is necessary if a lot of noise is present, since it is difficult to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="523">Repeat: specifies how often the algorithm is going through. normally 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">"angle increments da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if alpha is selected small, it should also be small. make sure that small angles have a long run time. therefore, you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs."</seg>
<seg id="525">"integrated stride length [0,1, 10]: integral step width in pixels. you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2."</seg>
<seg id="526">"use linear interpolation: the more quality you receive by selecting this option is only slight, but it doubles the runtime. we recommend it to let it out."</seg>
<seg id="527">The Save As and Load buttons make this happen. any adjustment of image errors can be saved to a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">"correcting image errors is relatively quick at work. however, it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the Cancel button."</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors can be corrected with small artifacts. the module is applied in a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see there is a peculiar black artefact in the foreground that caused by a bad film storage during the journey. the original image is under (1) to see and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digikam; noise reduction is a very powerful tool for reducing noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts that come from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">"if you need more information about the sensor noise of digital cameras, you can read them in this tutorial."</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene that was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grained noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">"in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the subwindow Advanced Settings can remain with the default settings."</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) used for the filter. large values increase the time the filters are used per pixel and can blurb the image. the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smoothed and thus minor errors are cleaned.</seg>
<seg id="536">"sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel pitch when the filter looks forward to determine luminance changes. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or smearing occurs again."</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong it can not be removed the entire noise or noise peaks can occur. set it to a value near the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artifacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend changing either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend changing either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gamma: controls the tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which are typically more raucous, but also lubricates the shadow areas."</seg>
<seg id="541">"attenuation: controls adjustment of phase noise attenuation. this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius reacts to variations of the luminance. if it is increased, the edges appear smoother when it is too high."</seg>
<seg id="542">Save under and load: these buttons are used exactly for this purpose. all parameters to reduce the noise you have set can be saved to the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). noise reduction was applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">"the solution to draw the image a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use the tool for soft sign with the menu entry of correcting softeners, and experiment with the smoothing. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo."</seg>

<seg id="546">"this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artefacts from your images. it is very well adapted to remove Gauss's noise, film gradation, scratches, compression artefacts and local errors that occur in digital, original or subsequently digitalized images."</seg>
<seg id="547">"the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / Frannkreich, and is part of the Cimg project."</seg>
<seg id="548">"reduce JPEG artifacts: compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far from it. as a lossy compression algorithm, it creates a few compression & quot; Artefacts quot; - small standards that are seen in the uncompressed image. this setting is intended to correct these problems."</seg>

<seg id="568">"many center filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 of the aperture filter, which increases the necessary shutter time under certain circumstances so that it is impossible to use the camera with the hand. wide-angle lenses should, even with center filter, have an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, otherwise there will be no blurred effects caused by movement."</seg>
<seg id="569">"with the large exposure of today's film and colour or grayscale depth of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a center filter by applying an equivalent transformation on a blank image that was made without this filter. the algorithm is protected by John Walker's copyright."</seg>

<seg id="571">"density: this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of the largest density filter. the standard density is 2.0, which corresponds to an optical filter with an aperture of 1, or by chance of a luminous intensity of 2, reduce the density to compensate for a greater degree of vignetting."</seg>
<seg id="572">"brightness, contrast and gamma setting: editing an image with the vignette correction reduces the brightness of pixels. you have to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the controllers only provide you with positive values, since you only need to increase the settings."</seg>
<seg id="573">"if you want a fine adjustment of the exposure of the target image, leave the values for brightness / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digikam; image processing from the Color Gradation menu."</seg>

<seg id="579">"the coefficient of the fourth grader corrects the distant corners towards that of the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometrical distortion can be almost eliminated."</seg>
<seg id="580">"general: this value controls the strength of distortion second degree. with negative values, tension-shaped distortions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion."</seg>
<seg id="581">"corner: this value controls the thickness of the distortion fourth count. this value acts more strongly to the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses, the 'corners' has the inverse insignia of the parameter General."</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scaled the image size and thus results in a correction of the first degree. negative values enlarge while positive image decreases.</seg>
<seg id="583">"brighten: this value adjusts the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values increase them."</seg>
<seg id="584">"to help you find the best filter settings, the dialogue with a preview illustrates the distortion correction. the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start."</seg>

<seg id="594">This is an example of the infra-red filter applied to a landscape photograph from New Zealand. the original image is shown below (1) and the processed image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">"the & digikam; filter film grading is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film grading on your pictures. this is known from classic high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, the makers mix large silver grains of photographic emulsion."</seg>
<seg id="596">"the film grading effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past. the treated image gets a timeless atmosphere loosened from everyday life. if you want this special, gallery-like, street photographic, grainy sight especially in your monochrome photos, you must use this filter."</seg>
<seg id="597">"the controller can calibrate the ISO sensitivity to check the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are needed, on ISO-2400. if you need even more grains, you can apply the filter several times."</seg>

<seg id="615">Zoom sharpness: blurred the image alongside star-shaped lines that emanate from a center. this simulates the blurring a zooming camera and thereby creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blurring: blurred the image by rotating the pixels by one focal point. this simulates the blurring of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance blurb: blurred the image to produce the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to resign in the background.</seg>

<seg id="619">Softening blurb: blurred the image softly into the dark and strong in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits or glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Sham sharpness: blurred the image by random shifting of pixels and thus simulates the blurring of an arbitrarily moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blurring: find the color basins in the picture and blurred them without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: shares the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it by filling with an average pixel value.</seg>

<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of the drops. since the droplet size doesn't automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops.</seg>
<seg id="626">"you can hold with the & digikam; image processing an area free of raindrops. use the selection tool to choose the area, e.g. a face that should stay free. if you then start the filter raindrops, the area will remain free of raindrops."</seg>

<seg id="651">"golden center: the golden middle is a division of different natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus mussel or the leaves of a sunflower."</seg>
<seg id="652">"the golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks to build your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden division at all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty."</seg>
<seg id="653">"the number derives from Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc. the resulting divider is 1: 1.618 the golden center. a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious."</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides smoother guides when you put together a picture. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">"in comparison with the third rule, the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition leads the gaze of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetric visual flow in this way."</seg>
<seg id="656">"a further rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. there should be something that directs the eye to the center of the composition. this can be a line or different objects."</seg>
<seg id="657">"the golden triangles are also derived from the golden spiral above. your vertices are the center points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are no equal triangles. diagonal to place these lines can cause a static object to appear more dynamic."</seg>
<seg id="658">"if you use golden triangles to break up your frame, you create an effect of dynamic symmetry called by professional photographers. try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles."</seg>
<seg id="659">The Horizontal options are mirrored and vertical mirrors can be used to mirror the harmonious divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">"with the color button, you can set the color of the guides. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the guides can be invisible. in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image."</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">"when you make a photo, it's easy to keep the camera vertically or horizontally. this creates an image in which things are rotated by an angle. you can fix this with the & digikam; image processing and the tool free rotation. select" "Transformers Free Rotation" "and adjust the target angle."</seg>

<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command-line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original quote from him is: do not expect from dscw not to create the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get better results with dscw!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the RAW file to be converted and start the module. the Raw Image Converter Window will then appear in mode for a single image. with the Preview button you can view the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">"you can now adjust the values to adjust the conversion process. the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for white balance. the main parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the image later."</seg>
<seg id="857">"a four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch does not have any effect."</seg>
<seg id="858">"once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the filename will remain the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossless algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it."</seg>
<seg id="859">"the Tagged image format, TIFF, retains all the information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compression."</seg>
<seg id="860">"if you plan to edit your pictures frequently or otherwise you should not use the JPEG format, since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality is deteriorated. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data."</seg>
<seg id="861">"if you select JPEG as a storage format, the metadata that contains in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the exif information."</seg>
<seg id="862">"if you have customized your settings, you can start the conversion with the Run button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel."</seg>
<seg id="863">"batch processing mode allows you to convert various images at one time. so use this mode if you are certain, e.g. by testing on a single image, which are the best settings."</seg>
<seg id="864">"the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. however, you have the possibility to override existing file automatically. however, this is helpful if they were created in a previous attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progressed."</seg>

<seg id="1042">"these images often have a Moirè pattern or tier effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than one pixel. this effect is called aliasing."</seg>
<seg id="1043">"& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the impact of this error. generally, pictures with this feature are better."</seg>
<seg id="1044">"when you turn on anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray; more than one beam per pixel. this technique is super-sampling."</seg>
<seg id="1045">"Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as a standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling uses the adjacent pixels. the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursively because each pixel will be split up again and again because the rector depth depends on the calculated color values."</seg>
<seg id="1046">"if you choose the first method, POV-Ray tracks a beam per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the defined threshold, then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 5 x5 (25) will calculate additional beams per pixel."</seg>
<seg id="1047">"the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: r 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel."</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">"the recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are individually followed and checked for further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion can be set with the depth value."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"another possibility to reduce the aliasing effect is the creation of noise for the ray process, called Jittering. if you turn on jittering, change & Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns."</seg>

<seg id="1521">"--preset standard '= This setting should usually provide acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces, and has already quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice."</seg>
<seg id="1523">"--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. requires always 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality."</seg>
<seg id="1524">"-h '= 128 kbps CBR joint stereo, compression rate about 11 128 kbps for all songs of a title. good Genug for music of young people, portable devices and autoclays. but not good enough for better hi-fi stereo systems."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want the highest quality regardless of file size, then select this setting."</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that is manually entered or fetched by the program automatically from the freedb over the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can pass / use it with & kaudiocreator; and the coding program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">"in connection with coding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoders explain the switches for these programs."</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for example, to add the CD; titles to the keywords (English: tag) when MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameters of & kaudiocreator; the result looks like: '... -tt {title}...'."</seg>

<seg id="1530">"this is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read / enter the audio CDs, so that all others can download this information instead of entering the computer. it's important to note that only text is spoken: & CD; Titles, artists, names of the pieces & etc;, not by the audio file itself."</seg>

<seg id="1536">"there are rumors that cdparanoia is used; if you want to know more about it, look in the source code....

<seg id="1537">"for saving the read WAV files, the encoder and thus the desired file format can be selected. when opening, predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) can be added on the tab to set up the encoder. other encoders can be added on this tab itself."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The encoder package must be installed from the Linux distribution in question before the encoder can be used. this is also required for predefined encoders. more information about codec are in the chapter Welcher Kodiver.</seg>
<seg id="1539">"after installing a encoder, more information about its switches can be obtained by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console)."</seg>

<seg id="1651">"the temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this does not play a role since it is not saved when leaving & kmid."</seg>
<seg id="1652">"this is absolutely necessary for synthesizers who are not General MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map translates general MIDI events into events that the synthesizer understands."</seg>
<seg id="1653">"for example, you can create a MIDI map that transforms all occurrences of the Change patch to Bright Piano in events of the Change patch to Trumpet type and thus always lets you sound a trumpet if originally a piano should play."</seg>
<seg id="1654">"if you only have a sound card, you don't need MIDI map because all sound cards are GM-compatible (incl. Awe - and GUS cards, FM devices and so on)."</seg>
<seg id="1655">"unfortunately, there are no programs to create MIDI maps. so you have to edit the appropriate file from hand (with your favorite editor)."</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI map is a text file that stores all required implementations for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">"each section may appear only once, except for the keymap section, which may appear as often as desired. however, the requirement for this is that each occurrence has a different text ID (see below)."</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define keymap "name of keymap"... END Define keymap "An additional keymap..." END Define CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">See that Define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as email so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support can offer for devices that are not General MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">This section specifies how the patches of General MIDI are displayed to your specific keyboard. general use looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">"please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the optional AllKeysTo M is used to show all tones that this instrument needs to put on the sound with the number M. if your keyboard does not support a gun shooting (GM-Patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with clay 60) which sounds similar to a gun."</seg>
<seg id="1664">"so if now a MIDI file should play a note with Patch 127 (gun shooting), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the tune 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"please note that here is the term drum patch of the patch, where each sound is a different percussioning instrument (drum, cymbal, maracas & etc;) and not the one where the sound means the pitch of the same drum (as some keyboards have)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to indicate how sounds are displayed on a particular channel or instrument.</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as with the PATCHMAP section, the order of the lines is very important, as well their presence. so you have to create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several key maps for each channel and each instrument. you only have to use different names in the first row.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are mainly used to map tones on the percussions channel. see for example the included keyboard maps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to exchange the first and second channel, simply do it in the CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a particular channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"if you use the keymap option, the keymap is used with the name Name for this channel. of course, if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored that try to change the patch on that channel. in this case, patch x is always used."</seg>
<seg id="1674">"for example, the ForcePatch option can be useful to always use the percussions patch on the percussion channel."</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for PitchBenderRatio indicates in which ratio pitch-bender events are multiplied. if a MIDI file sends a pitch-Bender event with the value n, it is converted with the n * (r / 4096) and then redirected. the value 4096 is used to make no decimal commas in the map file."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting is needed because GM shows that a keyboard, which receives a pitch-Bender event with the value 4096, should play a sound higher. unfortunately, some keyboards try to play two notes up to one octave. to find the correct value on your keyboard, you have to try a bit with & kmid."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"to use a MIDI map, simply open the MIDI Settings dialog. you will find this in the menu under Settings, point MIDI Settings"</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole set of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you see which sounds are being played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">"you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel. for each channel, there is a selection list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used."</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (up to now) two different views to display the played sounds. view the view in the Settings menu under the View Channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">"the speed LCD displays the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the higher the speed."</seg>
<seg id="1682">"you can change the tempo of a song. so, for example, if you find a song too fast to follow the lyrics, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows left and right of the LCD."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music. it contains the notes, rhythm, speed, & etc;. this can lead the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results, just like two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"well, I can't force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while a mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you get a similar sound quality."</seg>
<seg id="1685">"this can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) by & kmid; this happens because & kmid has been compiled without AWE support. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example by kmid; 's home)"</seg>
<seg id="1686">"I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all files separately."</seg>
<seg id="1687">"agree, therefore support & kmid; drag & drop. simply open the folder you want to add in & konqueror;, select all the files and drag them to the & kmid; window."</seg>
<seg id="1688">"before, enable automatic addition to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection."</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow button on the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow down playback. to restore the default tempo you can double-click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">"I have a & konqueror; window with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this desktop (if I play a karaoke file) or attached (if I play a karaoke file), I need to switch to the & konqueror; window and drag the desired file into the window of & kmid."</seg>
<seg id="1691">"if you just want to quickly listen to a file without adding it to a collection, switch automatic addition to the collection, and the new one; file will be added to the temporary collection."</seg>
<seg id="1692">"let's suppose you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.M. and C.mid. first you just want to play the first file. so, set the setting automatic addition to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file."</seg>

<seg id="2081">"in & quantaplus, there are some key concepts. to understand them and to gain full benefit from & quantaplus, one must first familiarise themselves with these fundamental concepts. this chapter tries to bring these concepts to them without their understanding and quantaplus."</seg>
<seg id="2082">"in & quantaplus, the working area is divided into three sections: global, local and project-related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus."</seg>
<seg id="2083">"global elements are available for everyone who uses & quantaplus. from toolbars to actions everything that is marked as global is stored in the shared folder structure of & quantaplus. this allows the group of administrators to back up different tool bars, actions and patterns in the global tree that will then be available to everyone in a multi-user environment."</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be everything from & CSS; samples to toolbars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project. simply said this is the most restricted size. all elements are stored in the project folder of the project which empowers the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">"the & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of several main areas: the editor window, the tree view, the cartons with information and the toolbars. please check in and for more detailed information about these areas."</seg>
<seg id="2087">"you can click the file leader with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document passable entries, such as close the current, other, or all file formats, reload, delete or upload the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document."</seg>
<seg id="2088">"right-click in the editing pane will lead to a further context menu concerning the edited document content, such as the basic editing steps (cut / copy / paste), edit the tag under the mouse pointer or open the file, when the string is called a file under the mouse pointer."</seg>
<seg id="2089">"at the top end of the editor window are the toolbars of the editor. currently, & quantaplus, & HTML; 4.01 Transitional serves as a standard for which a set of toolbars is shown."</seg>
<seg id="2090">"the use of toolbar buttons is really easy. if you want to insert a single tag, e.g. & lt; in your document, then click the icon that represents the tag. now you can insert the data for this just inserted tag. if you want to insert a day that has multiple attributes (such as anchors), you can fill in a dialog with different fields."</seg>
<seg id="2091">"the building manviews (QIT;) allow it to navigate in the information to & quantaplus. to navigate, open it and to strip it. in the presentation with cartons are available for files, project, sample templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation tree views."</seg>
<seg id="2092">"project Management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus. this view shows all the files in the project and allows to manage the files in the project by right mouse click. actions such as adding, removing, uploading or deleting the files from the storage medium can be done with the displayed context menu."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"a further possibility of & quantaplus, is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc; all possibilities are open to you."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"templates can be divided into three categories depending on what context they are used. the category depends on the & quantaplus, workspace. global templates are always available, local templates only available for the respective user and templates in projects are available only in the project."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"here you will find information about the available scripts. the concept of the integration in Global, Local and Project works here too. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can access the available information to a script."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"this view shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element, the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element. by right-clicking an element, a list of commands opens in relation to the navigation and refresher of the tree."</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears under the other tree views. it can quickly change attributes and namespaces. the application-oriented application system allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">"here is the complete documentation about web technology for your development. it can be downloaded pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus, from the quantaplus, 'documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project can be added, edited and viewed project-specific documentation."</seg>

<seg id="2281">"there are many graphical tools for comparing, so why & kdiff3;? let me briefly explain why I wrote."</seg>
<seg id="2282">"the merge was very complicated, because one of the contributors made many changes and at the same time corrected the indentation at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file."</seg>
<seg id="2283">"the program used by me only showed me the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly was changed within these lines. and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a small nightmare."</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could display differences within a line and changes to white characters. later a lot more useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">"for example, if you want to compare text quickly, simply copy it to the clipboard and insert it into one of the comparative windows."</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a full file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">"this is useful when two people work independently from each other on a piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps resolving conflicts and simultaneously displays the result to be expected. in this editor, you can even directly edit the result. the screen shot shows three source files when merging:"</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you comparing and merging complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; folder merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">"& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you frequently have to check code, you will like this function."</seg>
<seg id="2290">"differences in white characters and tabulators are displayed visible. if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters, one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column at the left side. (no more annoyance if someone changes the indentation.)"</seg>
<seg id="2291">"if a file is the same and the other differs in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both are different."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"if all files have the same name, but in different folders, then you can make typing easier by simply writing the filename of the first file. for example:"</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 folder 1 Folder 2 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder-1 folder-2 folder-1 folder-1 folder-2 folder-3 folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">"open dialog enables manual typing of filenames, selecting a file browser (file...) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop-down list."</seg>
<seg id="2295">"when you select a folder, the merge or merge of folders is initiated. if for A a file is selected, for B and C, however, a folder, then used & kdiff3; the filename from A in the two other folders."</seg>
<seg id="2296">"if merging is checked, the input field is active for the target and can be edited. however, it is not necessary to specify an output file immediately. you can also do this step later when saving."</seg>
<seg id="2297">The Setting button opens a dialog with Settings. here you can set options before starting the same / merging.</seg>
<seg id="2298">"sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison then starts immediately. in Open dialog, you do not need to select files, you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button."</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use dragging and dropping: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">"sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to figure out how similar these functions are, that would be a relatively big effort. you should first create two corresponding files, load them in & kdiff3; then you can simply copy, paste and then compare the relevant sections."</seg>
<seg id="2301">"note: currently, you can't remove anything from & kdiff3; only dropping text into a comparison window will be supported."</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the dragging and dropping text into another program than cut and paste (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"the info line of the source pane contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Every Info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, leave the mouse over the line for a while."</seg>
<seg id="2304">"the three source windows are the letters A, B and C. A has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these preferences can be changed through the settings menu.)"</seg>
<seg id="2305">"when a difference is detected, one can see the color, which file differs. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files. that's good in the next section (merging)."</seg>
<seg id="2306">"in some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (at C / C + + for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in few rare cases.)"</seg>
<seg id="2307">"the vertical line separating the assembly column from the text is interrupted at the places where the source file has no lines. if the line breaks is enabled, the line is dotted with broken lines."</seg>
<seg id="2308">"the result window (below the comparison windows) also has an info row with the inscription:, the filename and [changes] when you have edited the result. usually, it contains already text by automatic merging, but often it also contains conflicts."</seg>

<seg id="2310">"if only two comparison windows are used, each difference is also a conflict that needs to be solved manually."</seg>
<seg id="2311">"by clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows, the group belonging to the row will be marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed."</seg>
<seg id="2312">"this text does not appear in the final saved file, nor in a selection that you may copy and insert somewhere else."</seg>
<seg id="2313">"the text & lt; Conflict Conflict; however, appears in the clipboard, if you copy such text from the result window. carefully go with this function."</seg>
<seg id="2314">"note: when selecting sources, ignoring the options, ignoring ignores C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters."</seg>

<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summaries synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as already explained in the merging and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">"the toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous difference (Ctrl-Down / Ctrl-Up), to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-image) or to the next / previous unsolved conflict. therefore, between resolved and unresolved conflicts must be distinguished."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"to copy the selection to the clipboard, you must press the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Insert). there is also the option selection automatically copied. however, be careful with this option, but be careful because you could accidentally overwrite the contents of the clipboard."</seg>
<seg id="2320">"newlines are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix variants use a newline character\, and Win32-based systems use cart return + line feed\\ r\. KDiff3 does not keep the lenders of the source files, so you should not use binaries."</seg>

<seg id="2330">"some editors (on some systems) will save a character '\\' and a newline '\' at the end of one line, while others will be ignored. if this option is checked, you will be treated as a white character. while merging, this option has to be disabled. in default, this is disabled."</seg>

<seg id="2333">"the option is enabled in default. it is effective for complicated and large files, but slowly with very large files."</seg>
<seg id="2334">"in auto-jump mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next unsolved conflict is injected."</seg>
<seg id="2335">Automatic selection solves all conflicts in white characters using the selected file as a source. (default is manual selection.) This is useful when white characters are less important in many files. note that the automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments when the options ignore numbers or ignore ignores C / C + + comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are discussed in the chapter to scan folders and run a merge. see for details under documentation to compare and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">"if a file is saved and already an older version exists, then the original version will be appended to the suffix .orig. if such a backup file already exists with the suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further backup."</seg>
<seg id="2338">"adapt the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the current program. you need to quit and restart, so that the change is active.

<seg id="2339">"the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry. if this option is checked, the upper setting is used for all entries."</seg>

<seg id="2343">"if you define pre-processing commands, they might not work with your codec. (for example, your files could be 16-bit Unicode, but the processing command can only handle 8-bit ASCII)."</seg>
<seg id="2344">Switch this to suppress highlighting changes in white characters in text or reviews. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore ignores C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">"this selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences between two of three files will be displayed. but sometimes you might want to see only the differences between two of three files. after selecting A & lt; & gt; C or B & lt; C or B & lt; C or B & lt; C or B & lt; C or B & lt; C or B & lt; C or B & lt; C or B & lt; C or B & lt."</seg>

<seg id="2347">This can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">"sometimes view the differences and then decide abruptly to merge the files. a simple click starts the merge and uses the filename of the last source file as default name for output file.

<seg id="2351">"the idea behind this is to give the user more flexibility in setting up the Diff results. however, an external program is needed and most users do not want to program that by themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl completely sufficient."</seg>

<seg id="2949">"you can of course select another entry at this point. for example, in the protocol file system protocol, select the column process, and also enter the name of a process in the filter bar, so you will see & ksystemlog; all log lines that were sent or created by this process."</seg>

<seg id="2956">"welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, more known (and named in the following) as & ksysv; This section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv."</seg>
<seg id="2957">"the V Init system is rapidly becoming the standard for controlling the program starts when starting the system in the & Linux; world. it is because it is easier to use, more powerful, and more flexible than the traditional BSD init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further into historical aspects (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because maybe someone might try to change a machine on System V init without reinstalling and reformatting it. the & Linux kernel first looks under / etc after an init file. therefore, you need to make sure that the old Init was removed from there if there was one."</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init also differs from the BSD init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">"system services do not include such things like network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things as setserial, which is started only once. such calls are rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"for your part, rc.local should be in / etc / rc.d if you need it. you can also create a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches in different places after the program init and starts the first one that it finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default running level 3 is. if you want to change this, then you can edit / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you have messed up, then you can fix it by reboot the system and run the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it start all the correct scripts? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">"you will notice that there are no right files in this folder. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory."</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop. you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if a K contains, the script will be called with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script will be called with the argument start."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people wish to set up a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could have a server-running level which can run only httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc. in addition, I could also have a user-running level, the & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you will learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointing device is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six running levels to start (or stop) at this level.</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between Runmodes or change the position within a level by moving it elsewhere. this will not happen if you pull out an entry from the range of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries are moved when you move them into a new area. to only copy them to a new running level, you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert them in the target area -- even if the same entry already existed in the target area of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you must edit the sorting numbers of the resulting entries before you can try again to insert the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">"note: currently, there is no way to restore entries that were thrown into the trash. so be careful."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the Tabulator button to activate the different working areas (available system services, runlevel 1 start, runlevel 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move one entry to another runlevel, move it into the clipboard by cutting into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually, press the input button to change the Properties dialog. use the Tab key to change between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed."</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings are removed from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise they will be recovered by & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2982">"I experimented with the standard running levelers, and now the machine is restarting constantly. what can I do?"</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single user mode. then edit the / etc / inittab file and change the default level to a reasonable value (3 should usually be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">"I have some system services with & ksysv; for running under runlevel X, but they are not executed."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"if you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution manual."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the way system services are started in these distributions facilitates the configuration of the proprietary set-up programs of these distributions, but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you are using another distribution, please check that all configuration files are present (and whether they are in the right directory). some services (such as eg; Apache or httpd) simply quit without a message, if their configuration files are not present or incorrectly set up."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the meaning of the & Linux; running level varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use any other distribution, please send me information about the runlevel so that they can be added to this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">"to begin with & kuser; to begin, it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser; to read."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"after you've made changes, you need to save it. either use the corresponding toolbar icon or entry in the File menu."</seg>
<seg id="2992">"the main window consists of two cards, the user and the user group list. to edit, select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"some card-cards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings. only if you have enabled space restrictions (quota) for users, a card card is generated that you can make individual settings. other card cards appear, if shadow passwords or, for example, / etc / master.passwd as installed in BSD Unixes."</seg>
<seg id="2994">"the card pass password management appears, if shadow passwords or, for example, / etc / master.passwd like in BSD Unixes are installed."</seg>
<seg id="2995">"this card card only appears if it is enabled and initialized for at least one-bound file system constraint (quota) and initialized (recognizable by the file quota.user / quota.group on the file system). here, parameters can be changed for each user."</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be individually set for each file system. the current filesystem is selected using the field file system with limited space limitation.</seg>
<seg id="2997">"the group, to which the user belongs, can be found in the Primary Group field. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"the Dialogue properties of the group contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list."</seg>
<seg id="2999">"to add a user or group, select Add from the Users or Group menu or click the appropriate Add button of the toolbar. editing or Delete the selected user or group works analogue."</seg>
<seg id="3000">"with this module you can install the LILO system manager, add, remove and change the boot password, change the time up to boot of the default operating system, add the default operating system, remove, change operating systems, remove, change, and more."</seg>
