&quot; although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is exceptionally great .
&quot; like many of my generation , I grew up with American movies , danced to American music , read American authors and ran their sport . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had a profound effect on me that I was a journalist mainly because of an American film . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Peli@@ can Let@@ ter , a fear@@ less re@@ porter who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , revealed the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil magn@@ ate , who wanted to occupy the supreme federal court with judges who were interested in his interest . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free to Method Man , &quot; I was it as if it was the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the USA was only strengthened . &quot;
&quot; I always said , &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I even wrote a very black@@ ish love letter concerning his great@@ ness .
then Donald Tru@@ mp came .
much has been written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
&quot; in his opinion , he never stops the mountain , as one says so beautifully . &quot;
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague puts it , and publicly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ amer@@ ic@@ ans and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the people responded to his statements and voted in dro@@ ves for him . &quot;
the 13 million votes he won in the Republi@@ can elections was the highest number one ever won by the Party .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
&quot; who are the Americans who support this big@@ oted person , I asked myself ? &quot;
I couldn &apos;t reconci@@ le Tru@@ mp and his voters with the people I met in Phoenix during my time .
&quot; for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program that people from all over the world receive , a deeply believing person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s view of the world did not coinci@@ de with that of Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati Inqu@@ ir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
&quot; Tru@@ mp@@ s intoler@@ ance also contrasts with the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fought the environment for her life , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son . &quot;
she is still adapting to the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es who always helped me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
&quot; then there were Andrew leak@@ ey , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , their wis@@ er advice helped me a lot in my career . &quot;
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love of America .
&quot; while Tru@@ mp suspected his way to the nom@@ inate republi@@ can presidential candidate , she offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on November 8 , 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly White , gave the pres@@ idency to a man despite - or perhaps because of his contemp@@ t for non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the debate with the idea that people voted for Tru@@ mp because they shared their racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart . &quot;
perhaps it is unfair to design@@ ate the Tru@@ mp voters as ra@@ cists .
&quot; to classi@@ fy people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot;
this is superficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful and indicates an inability to understand those who act in a different way and think .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their congregations are not taken into account .
&quot; could it be that these voters , most of whom are white , voted for Tru@@ mp because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they might say they are still important in this America ? &quot;
maybe .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick who comment@@ ates on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down upon those who look different from him . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( note d . d . : white against all other ethnic groups , &quot; stem@@ ming white against the wh@@ ites and whi@@ pl@@ ash , which means so much like s@@ ling@@ shot trauma ) , as the big Van Jones called , has exactly what America has done so magni@@ fic@@ ently . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter if myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which belief or background one may have , America welcomes everyone . &quot;
&quot; this land chose as its president twice the son of a Ken@@ y@@ an@@ ers , whose history as he says himself , nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; but with the election of Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s , however , there is a huge part of the White America that promises and says : to Hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is again at the helm , say they . &quot;
&quot; with all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
&quot; on a demonstration for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp , would my son , captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot;
&quot; the crowd answered with a loud &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; ro@@ ared the crowd .
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they cried , and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot;
&quot; if someone , who is not like you , would have a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; NO &quot; !
&quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tru@@ mp , this is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
the country for which his son had fallen sent him a message .
&quot; this is now Tru@@ mp@@ s Land , said the message . &quot;
&quot; and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , couldn &apos;t find a place in this new America anymore . &quot;
and that breaks my heart .

from misery to the stars : these Latin American children can &apos;t spoil their love for music by rub@@ b@@ ish

what does the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero commune in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca have in common with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an city of C@@ ate@@ ura ?
&quot; the music played in both places not only changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the outskirts of a large garbage dump , only 16 kilometres south of O@@ ax@@ aca and # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; an old colonial town , which is very popular among tourists -@@ but worlds away from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; for several years now , La b@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( Music ban@@ de ) has been playing in the congregation : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty with their musical instruments . &quot;
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the church of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the community , located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for its abuse of drugs and gangs of gangs . &quot;
&quot; but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot , who launched a musical project and offered the youth such a rare hop@@ el@@ essness . &quot;
&quot; the young band members take their obligations towards the music group very seriously , writes the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI : &quot;
&quot; as soon as they come out of school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion . &quot;
&quot; they always come laugh@@ ing and with shiny eyes and play in the hu@@ stle and they learn the day for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , Wald@@ horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , bon@@ gos and the con@@ ga . &quot;
music from rub@@ b@@ ish
&quot; more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero are the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village that is located practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with re@@ manufactured instruments , made of local solid waste materials , produced in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ur@@ ura , where the recycl@@ ers under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez began to transform parts of waste into instruments . &quot;
&quot; instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double bass , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and percussion all produced out of the rub@@ b@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , Paragu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music from the Beat@@ les , Frank Sin@@ atra , etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article of the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , recalls the beginning : &quot;
first it was very difficult because we had no room for rehear@@ sals and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in tr@@ ash The children didn &apos;t know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children .
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something that he had never seen before : a violin made from waste .
today there is a whole orchestra playing instruments made of recycled material and which is called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
a documentation called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) records the musical performance :
&quot; every year , the world generates approximately one billion tons of waste . &quot;
&quot; those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est - like the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring performance of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played its music in front of Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can successfully combat illegal fishing
photo Â© F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that comb@@ ats wild illegal fishing .
&quot; this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published by En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports on international , practical solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
the re @-@ release happens within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices to share content .
&quot; in West Africa , it was known at that time that this ship had already run illegal fishing in Liberia &apos;s waters before it sought the other coast of Africa . &quot;
the East African countries were accordingly upset and little inclined to welcome a law break@@ er of this kind on their coasts .
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ ores , Mozambique and the Seychelles were quickly mobil@@ ised against the ship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries who simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; recalls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority . he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at its time . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was then distributed from the waters of the region : it was not possible for him to catch fish there . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars in Liberia , because of lo@@ oting the country &apos;s fish stocks . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal fishing stop ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries that then expelled the prime ministers from their waters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and work together . they exchange information and stand each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project provides technical support for F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , therefore it is extremely difficult to detect . thus , illegal fishing is a main cause of over@@ fishing of regions . &quot;
&quot; due to the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws , by which certain habitats and species are to be protected , illegal fishing may harm ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance . &quot;
&quot; but while actions against illegal fishing were once ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also through the sn@@ ail stamp , with which information circul@@ ated between individual countries , the actions are happening now in real time , trac@@ eable to F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; there the individual countries can exchange , for example , lists of existing licenses , news about suspi@@ cious activities or details that one had noticed or experienced during a harbour inspection . &quot;
&quot; fish @-@ i also atten@@ ds the activities of ships very attentive when they move on the open sea , via satellite data . &quot;
&quot; this allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in forbidden areas . also , such suspi@@ cious routes can be discovered - such as those suggest@@ ing that a ship invites its caught fish on the way to other ships . &quot;
&quot; ideally , such investigations show whether the participating ships have a fishing license where they were on the road and possibly also if they were a criminal . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of this information , countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse the adoption of such vessels in their ports . which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about substantial financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; this is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm that advoc@@ ates the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the already mentioned platform was created to rec@@ la@@ im estimated 20 million USD to lost revenue , which will lose the eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network every year because of illegal fishermen who enter East African waters . &quot;
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish@@ eries in which the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world .
&quot; such practices include sailing under false flag , fake license papers , specification of phant@@ asy names , fish @-@ protected species and fishing in nature reserves . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately exploit the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of a not completely organized control system , &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; in the past , a ship was able to fish illeg@@ ally and a country could say &quot; You dar@@ ed not go on my harbour . &quot; &quot;
but another country could say &quot; Come to me . &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i now .
&quot; so far , the closed front works . &quot;
&quot; since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i has participated in more than 30 studies of suspi@@ cious ships . &quot;
it has uncovered criminal networks that had spread fal@@ si@@ fied licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has pursued and found escap@@ ing ships .
&quot; due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to combat crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; Ber@@ gh says . &quot;
&quot; he builds a system that will help F@@ ISH @-@ i , locate suspi@@ cious ships more precisely . &quot;
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly being developed , also helps to track down the illegal ships that are happy to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO which also deals with fisher@@ y data and provides technical support for F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships , for example , turn off their automatic identification systems with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Cop@@ eland helps build a system that connects different levels of information . F@@ ISH @-@ i shall help to find criminal ships with greater precision . &quot;
a model program
but can F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations really influence the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO sky@@ Truth , believes that . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Sea Conservation Organisation ( Oce@@ ana ) : a platform that provides satellite data and by means of which the position of each tra@@ ck@@ able ship can be displayed worldwide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighbors , to get a better picture of who is doing what is doing - that &apos;s simply meaning , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and join their resources for investigation . &quot;
&quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust has to run a similar project where a global system allows the tracking of ships . &quot;
&quot; there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect criminals , but also deter them . &quot;
ships that were previously fishing without a license and had hardly to reck@@ on with consequences are now aware that they are being watched .
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH @-@ i have meanwhile recorded a 33 % increase in fishing sales , since fishing boats buy more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped to track Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found tow@@ ing nets where they were banned . &quot;
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we have become a study object . &quot; &quot; in West Africa several hundred million dollars annually disappear through illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; there six countries joined together in 2015 , the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they also fight against illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; security is the goal of allowing even more of such initiatives and structures to be created in other regions , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; only recently F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member of Somalia could make their first big triumph : in October , it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship sailing under false flag . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also im@@ bu@@ ed in forbidden waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; by taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they proceed against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i , this is another success of many . and at the same time the evidence that such a special , collaborative approach to the protection of the oceans really works throughout the world ocean . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London . there she writes about the environment , technology and nutrition . &quot;
&quot; their articles appear in Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela is escal@@ ating further : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of &quot; capturing the country &quot; &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are considered a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the inauguration of President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro .

&quot; after the government of Venezuela rejected the motion of opposition to a referendum on a referendum , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans , in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country , ran into empt@@ iness by gathering themselves in the streets . &quot;
&quot; under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( for example : the recovery of Venezuela ) , images of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them can be found . &quot;
&quot; the debate will also be conducted in other parts of the country - among others in the Bar@@ inas area , in the An@@ de@@ an regions MÃ©@@ ri@@ da and T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a , in the central @-@ north Bun@@ de@@ State Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the political and economic situation of the country is worsen@@ ing continuously , which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute shortage of food and medicines . &quot;
&quot; many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity for a fundamental change in the opening of the current President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro , but in the end the reluct@@ ance of a new election was blocked by the official authorities . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ Ã­@@ az , co @-@ acting with Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summ@@ arises in her latest article the context of the government decision as follows : &quot;
&quot; in the context of the social , political and economic crisis , where inflation and violence are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % at the end of the year ) and a serious and far @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine , the referendum was considered the only way to give the country the chance to re@@ conquer its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance . &quot;
&quot; the election alliance between Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ Ã¡@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic Union ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined forces , called for a mass rally to support the National Assembly in 2015 , and a march to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government seat , continued to pers@@ ist . &quot;
the call was commented on Twitter as follows :
&quot; it is as far as Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday nationwide civil strike and on 3 November all after Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace . &quot;

&quot; the first demonstration in the context of the action programme &quot; &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday , October 26 . &quot;
&quot; the pictures of the mar@@ ches published in real time testify among other things an overwhelming participation of the people in numerous areas of the country , but also confron@@ tations with polic@@ emen and advoc@@ ates of the government . &quot;

&quot; on Twitter , images that relate to disputes , as well as reports of oppression and mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment . &quot;
especially big waves beat the news of police repression in the centrally located town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there the demonstr@@ ators moved back to the local cathedral to protect themselves from the government and armed advoc@@ ates of the government according to their own statement .
&quot; hours later , they were able to leave the cathedral again safely , but the protests continued . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country , some prot@@ esters tried to stop the police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an State of T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a : &quot;
&quot; the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a do not wear skir@@ ts , because otherwise you could see something that many National Gu@@ ards do not have ! &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , an inf@@ ographic already makes the round that forms the level of suppression per day : &quot;
thus the dictatorship has oppressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for an appeal procedure - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of innum@@ erable people on the streets .

Nicol@@ Ã¡s and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of the sign@@ atures are fal@@ si@@ fied .
here is your pen@@ it@@ ement !

&quot; others evaluate these protests as a further step in the struggle against a government which , from their point of view , under@@ took little against the devastating economic crisis and would rather have dealt with critical voices : &quot;
they took us so much - but also the fear !
mar@@ ches are increasing in frequency and intensity .
&quot; some Venezu@@ el@@ ans told the media they were too hungry to take part in a strike , rather than to work or go shopping . &quot;

&quot; this is an adapted version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ Ã³@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , who was published on August 23 , 2016 at D@@ Ã­a a D@@ Ã­a , an Argent@@ ine@@ an news site . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to visit the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine city of CÃ³rdoba . &quot;
&quot; as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano has now spoken against his father as part of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial in the province of CÃ³rdoba . &quot;
&quot; in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were investigated which were committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not choose his life .
&quot; starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father right up to the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough . &quot;
he kept the family secret for 34 years .
&quot; in the situation at that time , I believed that it was fine . &quot;
I felt like a secret .
&quot; as a child with 15 years of age , one does not notice that one is being manipul@@ ated by his father . &quot;
&quot; at that time I could not see that my father was a th@@ ief , tor@@ turer and mur@@ derer . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was a gendar@@ mer@@ maid . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of state terrorism , his father was the deputy commander of the intelligence department in La Per@@ la from 1976 to 1978 . &quot;

&quot; but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor who is accused of kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ an@@ os &apos;s son , a man who , over the years , recognized the extent of atro@@ cities he had seen as a boy , and who testified before a Federal Court against his own father . &quot;
his story shows what great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a path of redemption for himself .
from the sports hall to the base of the military base
&quot; when my father started taking me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall with us . there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts . &quot;
everyone named him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and called on me to identify my friend .
he said :
&quot; you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you are friends with one of the ERP . &quot;
just watch out that they don &apos;t have to kidn@@ ap you one day and I must save you .
&quot; the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ Ã©r@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Revolutionary Workers &apos; Party of Argentina . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s why he for@@ ba@@ de me to go back to the gym . a few days later , he took me to work on the military base . &quot;
&quot; he told me , I would become a secret . &quot;
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine .
&quot; on the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; these were all sorts of documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , just everything . &quot;

&apos;@@ cause the prisoners are tortured
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la with everything in 1976 .
at first and last time he let me wait at the entrance of the car .
&quot; when he took me for the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a barracks , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - just everything possible . &quot;
everything was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a little pack@@ et wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big l@@ ump of silver in it . &quot;
&quot; on that day I went to the other end of the barracks , where the stolen objects were par@@ ked and kept me with a guard . &quot;
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tortured .
&quot; I sp@@ ed in , and saw a couch that was tortured to men . &quot;
it looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they attached the one end of a cable . the other end was attached to the person &apos;s body that was tied there .
&quot; they seldom put a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs on the bed , over@@ threw him with water and ch@@ ased him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts in the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the sten@@ ch there was horri@@ fic ... like a dirty wine .
&quot; years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came from his room . &quot;
I instantly recognized the smell and it became clear to me that this is the smell of a body in need .
I could never forget this od@@ our .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a person can do so much harm to another ?
I knew these people were killed &apos;
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were bound and bound with hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
&quot; he spoke to &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , a civilian who was also indic@@ ted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people were lying with the face downward - all were tied at hands and feet . &quot;
&quot; near the entrance , people c@@ rou@@ ched quietly on the matt@@ resses . &quot;
&quot; when my father saw that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; What do you think so , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot;
&quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; Why have you brought me otherwise ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know that because my father told me at home .
&quot; in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero smote and killed a man there .
&quot; according to the survivors , the civil war Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process , beaten the student Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death . &quot;
&quot; the following video shows Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the head of the La Per@@ la Memorial , through the former torture chambers . &quot;
the way you came in here is also the way on which the ab@@ duc@@ ts came here .
&quot; if you look on the map , you will see that they took about this path and then were tortured for the first time . &quot;
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
&quot; if they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came that they should be laid . &quot;
this was the lie - eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; war of war &apos;
my father brought home all sorts of stolen things .
&quot; at that time I had no idea what the &quot; &quot; war spo@@ ils &quot; &quot; - as they called it - was . &quot;
&quot; but when I was in the military later , - I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war ra@@ ids are a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military bad@@ ges , which one takes off an enemy whom one has fought . &quot;

&quot; but if one goes to a house and the refrigerator , the record player , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then this is not war @-@ yield , but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I have always wondered how my father , the leader of the security forces , could join this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I just don &apos;t understand it .
I was also an officer at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have liked to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; once he called me a criminal , and I answered , &quot; &quot; You who are driving cars on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded with rage , hit me and scre@@ amed : &quot;
&quot; when you go so far , I will find you and kill you . &quot;
we don &apos;t need anyone else to do that !
so my father was .
I have no good memory of him .
&quot; when I said in the process , I showed a photo from then on which I wore a jacket and a tur@@ t@@ len@@ eck pul@@ lover . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he still brought clothes to his home . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the defence accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator with this crime . I replied , no problem , they can lay down on me what they wanted . &quot;
I was there anyway to testify .
&apos;@@ the disappearance of corp@@ ses is the last abom@@ in@@ able act &apos;
&quot; now that I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; I have children . once you have children , you can recognize the value of a life . &quot;
one continues to develop and realize that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; well , you were exec@@ uting people during the dictatorship , but why did the corp@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
why kidn@@ ap children ?
&quot; one day , my father brought a girl home , whose mother had been killed . &quot;
&quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I always asked myself the question : they were tortured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
they could have simply put them into prison .
&quot; I guess it was just decided to kill these people , but why their corp@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
did these people not even have families to whom one could hand over their mort@@ al remains ?
the disappearance of corp@@ ses is the last abom@@ in@@ able act that one can do to a person .
&quot; my father told me when the democracy was introduced , they brought machines to remove the mort@@ al rem@@ nants of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were crushed and dispos@@ ed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; my father said . &quot;
&quot; but , of course , something remains . &quot;
I &apos;ve seen how you killed people !
only to clarify it : I have nothing against the military .
I was even in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 criminals - including my father .
the thought of showing my father arose during a conversation when he was placed under house arrest .
I repro@@ ached him for all the atro@@ cities I had to experience because of him .
&quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have killed anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly rejected and asked myself what all the exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; they allegedly defended , were good . &quot;
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me ?
I saw how you killed people !
you committed terrible crimes and you were forced to join me as a child .
&quot; he replied , &quot; &quot; Well , let me tell you . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is exactly what I did .
&quot; in 2010 , I reported the first ad . &quot;
finally I realized that he was a criminal .
nobody can repro@@ ach me that I am pre@@ occupied . I finally said against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest pending before the end of the trial .
&quot; he was charged with 4@@ 16 crimes : including serious , un@@ lawful de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 very serious cases , torture with subsequent death in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of a child under 10 years of age . &quot;

the judgments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the magnitude of the judgment in the Spanish .
&quot; after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process ended because of the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims , finally in August . &quot;
&quot; 43 oppres@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases , the court was sentenced to life imprisonment and in nine cases prison sentences ranging between 2 and 14 years . in six cases , there were acqu@@ itt@@ als . &quot;
eleven out of the 54 defend@@ ants died during the trial .
&quot; # La@@ Per@@ la@@ Jud@@ gement : murder , torture and rape by officials . &quot;
&quot; all the defend@@ ants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police officers and civilian employees . &quot;
Pier@@ o De Monti was ab@@ duc@@ ted together with his pregnant wife in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the silent chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by im@@ human heads .
the Court of Jud@@ gment is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for years on justice for victims .
&quot; Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ ine organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , founded in 1995 , who represents the children of people murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said : &quot;
&quot; the trial lasted more than three years , but the search for it lasted 39 years . &quot;
&quot; in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government passed the country on which La Per@@ la was located so that there could be a memorial to be established by human rights organisations . &quot;

&quot; translation errors make older people in Kyoto &quot; &quot; terrible car drivers &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the sign with translation errors at a centre in Kyoto , where you can extend your driver &apos;s license . &quot;
the photo was spread in the social media .
editing the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre where you can pro@@ long your driving licence , have witnessed a very un@@ successful translation last month . &quot;
&quot; on a sign , the Japanese word ( kor@@ ei@@ Bel@@ sha ) , which means &quot; older mot@@ orists &quot; means wrong@@ ly - but perhaps also with vi@@ cious back @-@ thoughts &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; as &quot; fear@@ ful mot@@ orists . &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building from 1 to 20 September .
&quot; editing the original photographs by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which has been widely shared in the social media . &quot;
&quot; the mistake was the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers . &quot;
&quot; the Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n , which appeared in Kyoto , wrote : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an insul@@ t to older people and in an international city like Kyoto , &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot;
&quot; the faulty English translation was first removed . the term &quot; &quot; bad drivers &quot; &quot; was later replaced by the appropriate , if also gram@@ mati@@ cally not quite correct name &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture was sorry for translation errors . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text they received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published . &quot;
a blo@@ gger reported as follows on the ap@@ ology :
&quot; we are really sorry that older people felt offen@@ ded by the inadequate correction ( the translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News made a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older mot@@ orists . according to the police , the proportion of older mot@@ orists who are embro@@ iled in accidents in the country are quite a cause of concern . &quot;
&quot; in Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19,@@ 460 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 . this corresponds to a share of 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors generated 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
&quot; as a result , their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % . &quot;
&quot; while the number of accidents decreased overall , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has increased in the same period . &quot;
&quot; the so @-@ called re@@ porter introduced comments to light in the version of the article published on Yahoo , which show what prejudi@@ ces some Japanese apparently he@@ ap against older drivers : &quot;
&quot; the article on Yahoo across the translation mistake received , among other things , the following comments : &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; dre@@ ad@@ ful mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; ) about not reality ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; So faulty is the translation not at all , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a real translation mistake . &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre mistakes in English .

the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold .
&quot; for transl@@ ating , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the initial text and active language skills in order to transfer it to the target language . &quot;
&quot; the latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case in native speakers . generally , the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - should be native speakers . &quot;
&quot; for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from the French into English . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r users Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies do not employ English as their native language , translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers that learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies that do not have a foreign workforce allow translations to be produced in @-@ house . then , the Japanese staff , whose English knowledge is considered to be the best , is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r users Karl Baron .
machine translation is also widespread - often with funny results .
&quot; the confused and en@@ ig@@ matic sentences , which arise through machine translation , show that this technique can not replace a human translator for a long time . this applies to some languages quite special . &quot;
&quot; some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the pu@@ zz@@ ling prints that often decorate t @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or even understood . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry . but from large companies or government that have the means to ensure higher standards , one can expect more careful translations . &quot;
&quot; in the future , the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more rep@@ utable source for their translations . &quot;
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship on the Internet and television
&quot; main page of the &quot; &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; &quot; portal ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay online . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that the internet presentations of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ oli@@ o TV were no longer accessible . &quot;
&quot; other online broad@@ cast@@ ers also carried photographs of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , organized by opposition groups , which oppose the government of Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ u@@ ros . &quot;
&quot; the protests began at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dissolved parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s duties to the executive and the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author of Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . &quot;
# C@@ ens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that the Internet pages of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are again blocked .
this is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
&quot; offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with the Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; traditional media have been hes@@ it@@ ant in reporting protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for Telec@@ ommunic@@ ation threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call for violence . &quot; &quot;
&quot; without cable TV and informative national TV channels , I signed up again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net . &quot;
&quot; surprisingly , that it is still cheaper than buying 2 litres of le@@ mon@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ S@@ fil@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . this also applies to the website where the National Assembly sends its sessions . &quot;
&quot; previous research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique by which the DNS server requests specific domains answer er@@ ron@@ eous . &quot;
&quot; if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server rep@@ lies incorrect or ref@@ und@@ able when calling on such a website . &quot;
&quot; we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net &quot;
&quot; V@@ PI@@ TV , a third blocked channel , was suspended on Thursday April 6 , when the V@@ PI@@ TV cam@@ er@@ aman El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who carried the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was imprisoned . &quot;
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in police custody .
he was released eight hours later and V@@ PI@@ TV went on stream again .
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government has also reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections , making it more and more difficult for Venezu@@ el@@ ans to access multimedia coverage of the current events in the country . &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to get education . &quot;
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child in Cri@@ adi@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
&quot; today T@@ ina fights for the rights of children and collects testim@@ onies of other Cri@@ adi@@ tas , who were victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;

the following article is the abri@@ dged version of a CSR report published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors .
&quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying C@@ ows , deca@@ ying schools &quot; ) edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot;
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university she once again returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; the one that has become something , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
but T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old she began working as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ tas , in Paraguay , the more than 4@@ 6.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a large family with little money transfers her under@@ age son or her minor daughter to another , ri@@ cher family . in exchange , the child receives food , training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; what is not mentioned , however , is that the children have to pay for it countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can become - and all this within the framework of a contract that cannot be raised . &quot;
&quot; this practice , referred to as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , is widespread in Paraguay due to its participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organizations . &quot;
&quot; after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a number of years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls were affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collecting testim@@ onies , resear@@ ching and den@@ oun@@ cing . &quot;
&quot; she tried to name things by name , as the feeling of gratitude that is ino@@ cul@@ ated with the cri@@ tique will generally be silent . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family , who has her daughter in faith , is able to complete her education , improve her position in society and &quot; &quot; make something out of herself &quot; &quot; to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family who receives the girl with him and whose exploitation is justified by faith is that they give someone a chance that otherwise would not receive education and maybe even star@@ ved . &quot;
the victims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will learn about it many years later . &quot;
sometimes they never even learn about it .
&quot; in January 2016 , the previously unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the hidden in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , got a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n came to the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº , her body showed signs of violent blows . shortly afterwards she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
&quot; she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military officer Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as a civil servant at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt . &quot;
&quot; Mar@@ Ã­n lived with them in her house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ rei@@ ra attacked Mar@@ Ã­n with a cane until she suffered deadly injuries . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
&quot; a few days later , the media reported about the incident . &quot;
they stressed that the murdered child was a cri@@ cket .
organisations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela accounted for the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl deeply rooted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society .
they called the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest in protest and demanded that there was &quot; no other Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered as children , &quot; &quot; T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a compla@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children . &quot;
&quot; without official documents , it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbors of the married couple and almost 60 civil society organisations demanded a rapid investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
&quot; if the case comes before the Court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n might be directional - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes in court . &quot;
the everyday life of a cri@@ adi@@ ta
&quot; the Cri@@ adi@@ tas are not only exploited as labour power , they also live isolated from other girls in their age . &quot;
&quot; T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , in which her father worked , had to opt @-@ in bankrupt@@ cy and her father lost his work . &quot;
&quot; their brothers now had to go to work , and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to earn money . &quot;
but they all went further to school .
only T@@ ina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n as Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
&quot; in the house of their employers , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day . &quot;
she had to divide the time in such a way that she could still have time to learn .
she stood at five o &apos;clock every morning and prepared breakfast for her employer .
&quot; for example , she cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor . &quot;
&quot; when the school was over , she went home again and had time to learn . &quot;
&quot; the sooner she finished learning , the more free time she had . &quot;
but also this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employer .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but she didn &apos;t get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to pick up more books from the house library as a food from the fridge , &quot; she recalls . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ant of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 , to the opposition . &quot;
&quot; on some evenings the owner of the house Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced him to stand next to him and read editorial from opposition papers like &quot; &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo &quot; . &quot; &quot;
he tried to persu@@ ade them to give no faith to the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; he thought she was intelligent , but did not stop with her . &quot; &quot; the master had found someone to listen while speaking about politics , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they didn &apos;t often allow me to visit my family because they thought that I would &quot; &quot; learn bad habits &quot; &quot; there again . &quot;
&quot; their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had made possible , she explains . &quot;
&quot; she was completely clear , however , that she had paid her hard work for everything she got from them . &quot;

the Society appro@@ ves the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share job advertisements for cleaning staff and children &apos;s girls in Paraguay .
&quot; the administrator of the group is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city coun@@ cill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ Ã³n district . &quot;
Hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
for learning .
please contact you .
&quot; starting from Monday , if possible . &quot;
&quot; the ad received five &quot; &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot;
a woman from the place Ã@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a eleven @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her telephone number .
&quot; another woman , who also came from Ã@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes little children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; the third comment was written by &quot; a girl from the interior , who wants to work . &quot; &quot;
then the summary of the advertisement turned again :
&quot; dear friends , I found one . I &apos;ll see if it works with her . &quot;
&quot; thank you , I am writing again , if something is . &quot;
the business was completed .

bill writes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
&quot; sixty Egyptian Par@@ liam@@ entary Committ@@ ees recently agreed to draft legislation on &quot; &quot; the regulation of use and benefits of social networks &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when it is adopted by the Parliament , users of social media in Egypt must register with a government agency in order to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law , a place would then be established that is mand@@ ated to give citizens permission to use social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months with the adoption of the law , users would have to register on the website of the site with their proper names and ID numbers in order to be able to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; if this fails to do so , this could bring a penalty of up to six months imprisonment or a fine . &quot;
&quot; the bill , which consists of six paragra@@ phs and cur@@ ses in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that runs over the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice , video alignment and text . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is adopted , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities can impose the registration . it is not clear how they should account for those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is not currently able to ensure regulation on the level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , Par@@ liam@@ entary deputy and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users received a username and password from the telecommunications ministry to get through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
&quot; this could mean that Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . due to that , it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information about their identity in order to access the network . &quot;
but so far it is not known that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; senior research techn@@ ologist &quot; ) at the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egypt Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I doubt the technical capacity and understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine that just as they viol@@ ently control physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; if I take them seriously , it means they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who seek permission or not . and that is a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to lead them to a trial . &quot;
&quot; this is technically not realistic , but in Egypt everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to be passed as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the Parliament &apos;s legislative and constitutional committees , before it enters the plenary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether his acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft is in line with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and it should be ensured that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration is present on the screen , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , the parliamentary deputy , T@@ amer El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y , proposed a bill against cy@@ ber crime in which a life sentence for those who are found guilty of threatening the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot; &quot;

&quot; high up in the mountains of the Kurdist@@ an region in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the animal prot@@ ector H@@ ana Ahmed Raz@@ a and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organisation Nature Iraq work to protect the ghost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ard . &quot;
&quot; a sub@@ species of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards wander@@ ing through Africa and Asia belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus Sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether , it is endangered between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . &quot;
why is this specific type of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; as Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; &quot; the Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining predat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; &quot; and the health and the flour@@ ishing of the ecosystem also depends on a large predat@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the free wilderness is small and goes against zero . as the team in the video determines that they have a recording of a big cat in the cam@@ era@@ woman , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy . &quot;
&quot; as a bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a is passion@@ ately fond of a different side of her country , which is not only of war and conflict . &quot;

&quot; a huge earthquake , ts@@ un@@ ami and an nuclear accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had caused the catastrophe . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , located in the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was an important pre@@ f@@ ecture in Japan &apos;s Nor@@ theast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami . &quot;
&quot; hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to evacu@@ ate , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had caused entire coastal cities to disappear from the map . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma experienced a nuclear accident , already alone that 160 000 people had to leave their homes . &quot;
&quot; the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows , from a local point of view , what progress has been achieved six years after , in order to rebuild the lives of the local residents . &quot;
the detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics from the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as survey results of the victims themselves .
&quot; housing construction in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that by December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses ( on the outskirts of Sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures was Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , where 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate completed 75 percent of such homes , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma with 70 percent forms the final light . &quot;
&quot; however , even six years after the catastrophe , it is still endeav@@ our@@ ing to reloc@@ ate evacu@@ ation of residential accommodation ( to the &quot; &quot; ca@@ ets@@ u ju@@ ch@@ ak@@ u &quot; &quot; ) in final replacement houses . &quot;
&quot; after the thre@@ ef@@ old catastrophe nearly 80@@ ,000 people saw themselves forced to live in shel@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 more than 36@@ ,000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such homes . &quot;
&quot; almost 40 percent of the evacu@@ ated people in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters , while Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 per cent of the evacu@@ ated people who were homeless in shel@@ ters were reloc@@ ated into final houses . &quot;
&quot; for I@@ w@@ ate , the figure is 34 percent . &quot;
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
&quot; as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper was able to determine , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools that were affected by disaster have re@@ opened their doors by December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; six years later , industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult . &quot;
&quot; while nearly 100 per cent of the fishing har@@ bours in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are in operation , only 30 percent of the fishing har@@ bours have resum@@ ed their operations in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of the agr@@ arian country , the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident have suffered large @-@ scale farming . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of the agricultural land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed agricultural land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that this is just a consequence of the nuclear accident , as only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of land destroyed by Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma are located in the &quot; nuclear barrier zone . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered largely , but here too Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far removed . &quot;
&quot; the tourist figures in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are up to 90 percent on the same level , as before the mis@@ fortune . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can show only 75 percent here . &quot;
&quot; however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal dwell@@ ers , it is more difficult to earn their livel@@ ihood . &quot;
is the local population prepared for the next great earthquake ?
&quot; in order to obtain an overall picture , the newspaper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and the evacu@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in her introduction to the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains : &quot;
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the local population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents took measures to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
&quot; however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 per cent of the respon@@ dents find that still not enough in things disaster prevention was done . &quot;
how it is about those who had to be evacu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture
&quot; in her issue on the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the evacu@@ ated people from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to experience not only the enormous earthquake and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture was also witness to the worst , disaster @-@ induced nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed . &quot;
&quot; of 160@@ ,000 Ev@@ acu@@ antes from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , nearly 63 000 people were transferred to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 some more than 23@@ ,000 people were transferred back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , in permanent replacement houses . &quot;
&quot; after the 2017 stand still 40,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma live outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; in the disaster areas most of the evacu@@ ated ones , who still live in residential shel@@ ters , are older than 50 years old . they are known to fail because the efforts to rebuild Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma will compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020 . &quot;
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; when one encounters people from other countries that speak a different language , the differences seem to be bigger first than the simil@@ arities . &quot;
&quot; after a while , however , one often recognizes that one more connects than it seems at first sight . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , we look at these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast , we deal with topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve . &quot;
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment when they have felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country boundaries .
&quot; Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ kon@@ i speaks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ manu@@ man explains how the love of music has strengthened the lack of common language skills during a journey in rural China ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences , which he collected in a small village in Madagascar . &quot;

&quot; a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week : last Friday , a police officer had killed him in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with a stroke against the head . millions of demonstr@@ ators participated in a protest march against austerity measures across the country . &quot;
&quot; Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who studies social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures . &quot;
doctors operated on this Saturday and moved him into an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
&quot; the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which quickly spread quickly in Brazil within a few days . &quot;
&quot; on the pictures is also the face of the police officer , who attacked with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o . &quot;
&quot; after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s known that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the investigation of the incident was suspended from the active ministry . &quot;
the pictures show the police officer as he strikes in Go@@ i@@ ana with his punch on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
&quot; if a police officer would be beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and land on the intensive care unit , his face would be on television for six months and the entire repression would be justified with it . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; &quot; Des@@ ol@@ aliz@@ ador &quot; , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ ana , shared the video taken by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z in the net , in which one can see how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ edic shortly thereafter . &quot;
&quot; another video with the same scenes , but filmed from another perspective , is also immersed in social networks . &quot;
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus down the 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the Mat@@ eus family who lives in another state , Internet users have now donated $ 10,000 in Brazil to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to enable his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ ana while lying in the hospital . &quot;
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus . &quot;

&quot; on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s : &quot;
&quot; Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s is experiencing a wave of political violence : here , the activ@@ ist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish was assass@@ inated by his father in order to crimin@@ alize the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . &quot;
police attacks
&quot; Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only state in Brazil , in which there was brutal police intervention against demonstr@@ ators last Friday . &quot;
&quot; police officers were in protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a stage for or@@ ators , rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas . &quot;
&quot; the MEP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , the Socialist and Pe@@ ac@@ ekeeping Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to refrain from violence against demonstr@@ ators via loudspeaker announcements . &quot;
&quot; this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media have covered street protests by focusing on another unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window pane . &quot;
the Fol@@ ey de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo were pur@@ pos@@ efully reporting a broken glass window to illustrate their front pages illustr@@ atively with a photo .
&quot; on the other hand , O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a bus set on fire . &quot;
&quot; there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic cause , more about a broken window @-@ window than about the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special cause . &quot;
you must also recognise this if you are strictly against any kind of damage .
&quot; here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; ob@@ serves absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate significance , and the typical violent acts of the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; demonstr@@ ators on confrontation with the police . &quot; &quot;
the Un@@ char@@ ted Villa@@ ges of Cuba
&quot; with the introduction of the law of Ã@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in all of Cuba joined the doors ( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta ) &quot;
&quot; Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , who is located in the western Cuban province of May@@ ab@@ que , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - not@@ withstanding that there is no significant sugar harvest on site . &quot;
it is two years since the activities were paraly@@ zed in the sugar cane factories .
&quot; after the earthquake , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory gradually lost its plants until only the ru@@ mo@@ urs of steel and concrete remained . &quot;
about 27@@ 2 workers had to re@@ inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the job .
others res@@ igned and commu@@ te daily to the factories that are still grinding .
&quot; N@@ ene , a soldier @-@ veter@@ an who rises every day at 4 : 00 am , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which are in operation after a long in@@ active period , because they were obtained . &quot;
that was something he did not expect .
&quot; N@@ ene seems to have heard exactly that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar cane industry already resist@@ s the pla@@ gues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , poor administrative decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 . &quot;
&quot; the message would have been a motive for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no news anymore . &quot;
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off ?
the old platform of the municipality already saw better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated , and hardly competitive they were un@@ sustainable for the country . &quot;
&quot; the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tonnes . &quot;
they left only the factories which can produce sugar for maximum 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution to unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of the sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 Report &quot; Regional economic perspectives &quot; by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organisation . &quot;
&quot; if current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate about 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; the present day will certainly go into history , &quot; these were the first words of the Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro in his speech on October 21 , 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander . &quot;
from then on the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
&quot; in the following years , the shut@@ down of a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people , received their full salary for further education . &quot;
&quot; the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 . &quot;
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez has been working in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , talks about the closure of the factory , the word he repeated the most is &quot; sc@@ am . &quot; &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents said the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
&quot; in order for the place to be preserved , they constituted a full @-@ time working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first closing year , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; it was officially recorded documents , which differ only concerning the parts that would be removed , the address and the date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could appro@@ ve of any withdrawal . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the responsibility was taken over and the letters were getting more and more frequent . &quot;
&quot; Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the shut @-@ down factory for two years , and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in operation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , wa@@ its for retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory , in whose construction he helped . &quot;
&quot; with every part he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 years of work . &quot;
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important work@@ station was wi@@ ped out .
&quot; in many cases , there were no alternatives for the jobs and services that the plants generated in the communities in which they were located . &quot;
&quot; we will never know if during the mam@@ mot@@ h speech of October 21 , 2002 , the former president saw in the eyes of the people present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would run well . &quot;
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar cane factories
&quot; since 2004 , sugar cane is extracted only highly by milling . &quot;
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; after two years Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar cane factory closed , or rather , when they began to dis@@ assemble them , they also stopped to gr@@ ate the road , this dis@@ advant@@ aged other companies . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to pick up other factories . &quot;
they became spare parts .
&quot; without prospects for the future , many young people left the region . &quot;
&quot; in the area , a food factory was created whose production does not even serve for the care of the community . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
&quot; at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene returned to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the site of the site where he began to work . &quot;
&quot; forty @-@ nine harv@@ ests bring the old soldier a pension of two thousand pes@@ o per month , to spend the years in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich . &quot;
&quot; Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a re@@ warding person , yet he for@@ gives the lies that he told him . &quot;
they have been tor@@ menting him for ten years .
&quot; N@@ ene goes into retirement with 65 years , not because it lacks power , but because he is bit@@ tern@@ ess . &quot;

first Nations youths use Hip @-@ Hop to express their own culture and get their own culture
recording of a song from &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .

&quot; young people from the First Nations communities all over Canada are dealing with topics that are important to them . they do it with hip @-@ hop , thanks to a number of hiking workshops . &quot;
&quot; as part of the N &apos; we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour , workshop leaders have been bringing mobile audio studios to schools and youth centres since 2014 , in order to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances . &quot;
&quot; the original workshops were led by the pedago@@ gue David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North @-@ Que@@ bec with ten C@@ ree communities and then collabor@@ ated with the C@@ ree Hip @-@ Hop @-@ Group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars . &quot;
&quot; the workshop is thus increasing that the young participants learn about topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , debate , love , self @-@ acceptance &quot; or whatever comes to mind . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the protagon@@ ists .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ Yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ eb@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a section in western Canada , where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered . &quot;
the cases were largely not solved .
&quot; the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka C@@ ree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs , despite the influences of globalisation . &quot;
&quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the youths do not always know the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i C@@ ree First Nation has recorded , the refrain is sung on C@@ ree . &quot;
&quot; the young people involved got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ stars hip @-@ hop group , who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay C@@ ree dialect . &quot;
&quot; on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , the stan@@ za is available in Um@@ schrift , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German here : &quot;
sometimes I feel like no one ever is interested in me
but I try to continue my days on earth
that is the day when you will take our cry
because we as youth have lost our way in life
but I believe we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
&quot; in this way , they can grow and also move forward to our youth &quot;
so they can do what they intended for the Creator .
&quot; in the comments section , the reader and advocate of the C@@ ree @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also makes a contribution and adds the st@@ rop@@ he in sy@@ ll@@ ables ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) : &quot;
&quot; in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant &quot;
plastic dishes ( on the other ) outside of a typical restaurant in Japan .

in Japan you can see plastic dishes almost every restaurant .
&quot; to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , are displayed near the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( the &quot; &quot; plastic models of the dishes &quot; &quot; ) of each food served in this restaurant . &quot;
the customers see themselves in these plastic dishes and then decide if they enter the restaurant or continue .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
&quot; there are a variety of small businesses in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which produce those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them any more . however , a new trend is turning them into show@@ y mobile accessories and other gad@@ gets today . &quot;
&quot; at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published a number of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
&quot; now in special sales : new mobile tapes decorated with plastic , as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store . &quot;
&quot; many of these artificial foods have been transformed into kit@@ sch collection objects , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets : &quot;
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin cooling cabinet magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in food supplements is becoming increasingly more complex .
&quot; in this case , ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular rice dish with seafood ) was turned into a mobile support . &quot;
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lol ) we found a good use as a mobile support .
we have also produced this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple that holds your mobile phone :
&quot; designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is a great design . &quot;
and that is only the beginning of an increasing flight into the com@@ ical .
&quot; some mobile support and mobile phone designers allow you to make your own work of art . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a or laugh@@ ed @-@ s@@ wine is used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice . &quot;
&quot; on Twitter , some users had their doubts : &quot;
&quot; is there someone who would say : &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile phone with laugh@@ ing ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I &apos;ll be the only one .
&quot; this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appeti@@ zing form , for example to surprise colleagues or family members . &quot;
our latest mobile phone stand has the form of melting ice .
&quot; in addition , we also offer rice balls ( oni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ tapes of dried salmon . &quot;
further qu@@ ir@@ ky plastic dishes can be found at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter to the h@@ ash@@ tag # to as well as the other .
&quot; if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the part of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry . for example , the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
the following video shows how Japanese plastic dishes are actually manufactured .
a Mexican project tells the stories of survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the fight against the drug traffi@@ ckers . &quot;

&quot; in reports of domestic and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; &quot; fighting against drug trafficking &quot; &quot; in Mexico , the mixed and killed regularly appear only in statistics . however , these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; reporting on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , the head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the ber@@ eav@@ ed or the churches that have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; behind every body , behind each bone find find hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co has launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co . &quot; &quot;
animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co describes the project like this :
organised crime does not just let us fear our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
&quot; for example , if businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and whole communities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk . &quot;
the pain of the victims
a video entitled &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how fear is changing life &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
&quot; a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who searches for secret tom@@ bs after his son every weekend . &quot;
&quot; Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her four brothers , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ew on just one day . &quot;
&quot; priests : &quot; &quot; like every Sunday , we prepare ourselves today for the task that we have asked ourselves to go and to graves , to the people we have loved . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never returned . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very hard for me , because I am now alone with three children who need education . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , who is here with me too . &quot;
at the moment she has no income .
&quot; you are entitled to the insurance of my father , but they do not pay them out because they demand a death certificate . &quot;
where should we get this ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and state leadership . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports from journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co , wrote this article from Tax@@ co , in the federal state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal , no matter what form it occurs : &quot;
I have been familiar with disease and sensation@@ alism for several years now .
&quot; every day , I come by newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the front pages with images that can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from experts from specialists . &quot;
it brings me out of the frame .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one that is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different to this or consider this as normal .
she writes on :
&quot; no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old cous@@ in thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) if he is big . and it &apos;s not normal that people listen to songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me , this is as if they ridi@@ cu@@ le those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something has happened to them . &quot;
I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statisti@@ c .
&quot; the in@@ action of the people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified with the fact that they were &quot; &quot; so@@ aked &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think they try to persu@@ ade themselves to be spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies , if they do not stir and remain silent . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the capital district : how a family was lo@@ oted with threats , &quot; she describes how armed criminals forced money from their business for month until they destroyed not only the business , but also tore their family apart . &quot;
you think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
&quot; pain never passes , the trauma stays , the fear comes up again when you are alone . &quot;
&quot; habits have changed , phone numbers too . &quot;
we will only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the farther we are away from each other , the better . &quot;
she closed her report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will kidn@@ ap or kill you . &quot;
&quot; in these terrible days I asked if tears would dissolve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I must learn to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : a Generation of Viol@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement at the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care about them . &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan is an orph@@ an and he tells us how to cook an egg , cook potatoes , make tor@@ till@@ as warm and make &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for each year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
&quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood had passed two years before , when he saw only a few blocks from his home , the bloody corp@@ se of his father , who had been shot by armed men from a passing car . &quot;
&quot; when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez looked like this : &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , as violence by organised crime and the fight against it mixed with the already existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world because of the number of mur@@ ders according to the citizens &apos; council for public security and government of the United States government . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the public prosec@@ utor called 3@@ 103 mur@@ ders . this corresponds to the average of 8,5 mur@@ ders per day . &quot;
these are just a few hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country .
&quot; only a few stories continue to live in the face of ever new head@@ lines , but this project reminds us of those who are not allowed to forget . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose objective is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed battle against drug trade , which has tor@@ mented the country over the past four decades . &quot;
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
sharing is Car@@ ing by the Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this article and the pages to which it is linked contain pictures on which violence is represented .
the fact @-@ check is important at a moment when it comes to raising a report or to expose a fal@@ si@@ fication .
&quot; but how is the year after something has appeared for the first time ? content in social media , no matter if true or un@@ true , tends to pers@@ ist . &quot;
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
&quot; since its first publication , it has been mis@@ leading to portra@@ y trage@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this false link between picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample thorough coverage of events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but it raises questions about our desire for pictures and messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a tank truck crossed the village of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , collap@@ sed and explo@@ ded . 230 people died . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country has been neglected for years and thus devast@@ ated . the streets in the region have become dangerous path@@ ways full of pot@@ holes that were difficult to navigate . &quot;
&quot; tra@@ gically , the tank wagon fell victim to it . &quot;
&quot; officials described a fire@@ ball , which envel@@ op@@ ed dozens of houses including a cinem@@ as nearby , which was full of people who looked at the football world champi@@ onships . &quot;
houses burned and char@@ ted corp@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burnt to infin@@ ity .
&quot; a picture entitled &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from the Im@@ g@@ ur User Mysti@@ cal Monkey , January 12 , 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident illustrate the dre@@ ad@@ ful scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of char@@ ted bodies lined up on the ground while people look at it .
but here the story does not end its end .
&quot; over the years the same photo was repeated several times on social media , blogs and other platforms and wrong@@ ly attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
&quot; on 3 January 2015 , comb@@ at@@ ants of B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on . &quot;
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dr@@ astically about atro@@ cities they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and corp@@ ses were lying in streets and bushes .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; no one left behind to count corp@@ ses , &quot; &quot; said a citizen to Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many were dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned . &quot;
only on the basis of satellite images the follow @-@ up time could be depicted visually .
&quot; the cause for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the military base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military of Nigeria and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to win the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
&quot; and here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again , as it was fal@@ sely presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack : &quot;
this is Nigeria .
&quot; a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris . &quot;
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a series of abor@@ tions ; Africa Check has documented regulations on Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in all these cases , the picture was presented as a cover for mass kill@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; one step further , personal comments such as this example wrong@@ ly bring the image from DR Congo to sources of mass media in order to deliver arguments . &quot;
the image from S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a lightning report , published by the United Nations , those who were fle@@ eing could flee , rape and several dead , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported about the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Post@@ s appeared like the following who brought these descriptions together with photos from DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this image comes from an Saudi Arabian news site , which fal@@ sely claimed to be President Myanmar &apos;s Th@@ an Being , monks and politicians allegedly participated in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , they used the image from DR Congo to capture this information . &quot;
&quot; the original contribution , which was accessed last on 26 April 2017 , can be called here . &quot;
&quot; other news organizations , called AF@@ P as their source , also wrong@@ ly attributed this statement to Th@@ ein &apos;s existence , but had not associated with the image of the DR Congo . &quot;
the worldwide range of false information
&quot; traces of these false links go back to 2011 and 2012 , and indeed come from all over the world . &quot;
&quot; using an &quot; inver@@ ted picture search , &quot; you can see how far more information can cross borders . &quot;
&quot; an inver@@ ted picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures below 18.@@ 8 billion images ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) , which are similar to the said picture from DR Congo . &quot;
&quot; they come from a mixed mass of private sites , social media platforms and common and national publications , and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
&quot; some have forwarded incorrect reports , some have attempted to expose the fal@@ si@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; we have del@@ im@@ ited examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use and linked them to the respective countries , on the basis of what they have been published on which page they have been published . &quot;
several examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use can originate from the countries listed below ( which in some cases have been linked together ) .
here are some cases that can now be fully detected ( on the map in orange ) :
map : news frames .
case studies of wrong coupl@@ ings of the image from DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries point to pages or servers which are still available through the examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or false noti@@ fications .
&quot; the countries in Gra@@ u are examples that , according to the metadata and information available about Tin@@ Eye , are probably also examples of for@@ gery . &quot;
&quot; as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;
&quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what is happening in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the picture from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread on the &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot; &quot;

&quot; in this article , a blo@@ gger from Que@@ bec City not only comm@@ its fal@@ seh@@ ood , but also discusses the mis@@ use of the image from DR Congo in connection with Nigeria and further questions about the intentions of the people and the trage@@ dies involved in it ( in DR Congo and beyond ) . &quot;

&quot; even within Nigeria , the photo from DR Congo was shown as evidence of the bom@@ b@@ ings of B@@ oko Har@@ am in K@@ ano in public discussion forums . &quot;
&quot; Malaysia , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Malaysia offers two extreme examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from DR Congo , on the one hand a tweet that expresses sympathy with the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger , the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are being pursued , because the photos were ab@@ u@@ sive . &quot;
&quot; Myanmar , 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the Myanmar government has issued a judicial review of what it advoc@@ ated as &quot; deliberately false news and photos , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings with regard to Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this judgment , published exclusively in English , also includes references to fake images of od@@ ors that H@@ ate Spe@@ ech used and used by extrem@@ ist groups to declare that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and other sr@@ um ( which is often spread by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) . &quot;

&quot; this post , addressed to the members of the Orthodox Church , clearly shows that the image of the DR Congo does NOT show Muslims to kill the Christians . &quot;
&quot; Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this news site fal@@ sely claimed that the president of Myanmar Th@@ ein stated his 2012 , that monks and politicians had participated in killing the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image from S@@ ange . &quot;
&quot; the article was updated in 2014 , and at the time of this publication the picture is still included in it . &quot;
&quot; Spain , 2015 / 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this article from 2014 about students who had been killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the An@@ Ã¡@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital news site , has expressly declared that the picture is not of the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it represents a &quot; &quot; similar jihadi@@ st attack &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when the picture was put into circulation in the context of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 , the El Pa@@ is newspaper tried to refu@@ te the fact that there were connections to Nigeria . &quot;
&quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ Ä±@@ y@@ or@@ dung y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burns , the world is asleep ) . &quot;
&quot; the image of the DR Congo emerged , marked with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion among Muslims following the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to achieve greater attention to these events , which allegedly took place in the name of Islam . &quot;
&quot; United States , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the picture was twe@@ aked as proof of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ) . but the messages associated with it were not taken up in any religious context . &quot;
&quot; instead , the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
&quot; Vietnam ( Portuguese ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message that was allegedly written by a &quot; &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums like this one in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it to be false . &quot;
&quot; the organisation of the Francis@@ cans Mission@@ aries and Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dist@@ anced themselves from the message , in which the image from the DR Congo was included . &quot;
&quot; there are other confirmed examples of incorrect use of the picture from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the cap in Gra@@ u ) also point out , but are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the craw@@ ler and occasionally they have image file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
&quot; in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original piece of 2010 , the picture may ultimately contribute to a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and pictures
there are two strong themes or frames ( frames ) that pass through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used in relation to greater discussions about silence in connection with the kill@@ ings of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the assass@@ inations of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fr@@ aming uses the picture to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued compared to a European or French life .
&quot; to understand religion and the value of human life is important . therefore , it is worthwhile to examine how images are used in connection with these efforts . &quot;
&quot; a deeper question is , however , what happens when readers can no longer believe these images . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are tens of people who in@@ adver@@ t@@ ently have a share of the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; this mood of mis@@ - and fal@@ seh@@ ood suggests that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and dimin@@ ish the real horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ? &quot;
the spread of forci@@ ble pictures has already been extensively deb@@ ated ( here for example ) .
&quot; one argument is that the retention of images of a refusal is equivalent to acknowled@@ ging the tragedy . occasionally , these images are even demanded by the victims themselves . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the concern is that violent pictures sensi@@ ti@@ ze readers and viewers and take the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which investigated how forci@@ ble media works to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot to discuss with violent portra@@ y@@ als in the news media , it is a fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting . &quot;
&quot; techn@@ ologists are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something , which can actually be solved by context or in an entirely ab@@ u@@ sive way . &quot;
&quot; however , each examination of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how internationally they can be . &quot;

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy Sim@@ mons uses CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
&quot; a blog named un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g. uns@@ ett@@ able ) tries to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world , which are difficult or not to translate at all . &quot;
&quot; there are such words in every language : they express certain situations or feelings , which are often very complex or specific . &quot;
&quot; some of these uns@@ ett@@ able words are already well known today ( such as the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others , deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example , the Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) . &quot;
but all resist persist@@ ently every attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; a word or expression is not enough , why a full explanation and sometimes a little context are required to understand exactly what is meant with this one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird has decided to focus on small languages . &quot;
&quot; for example , in the blog you can find words from the Van@@ u@@ atu magazine , such as : &quot;
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; - Get to know your parents in recognition of how they have committed themselves to you in your younger years . &quot;
words in the H@@ uns@@ rÃ¼ck language spoken in parts of Brazil such as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The convenience or la@@ z@@ iness that you feel after being war@@ med up in the sun , in cold days . &quot;
in Bir@@ ds own words from his blog about :
&quot; they resol@@ ute other cultures , reveal other thoughts and aw@@ aken our curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page even more of these &quot; uns@@ ett@@ able &quot; words , and show how different , valuable and impressive these little languages are . &quot;
&quot; or@@ ators of the &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages , &quot; which are highly appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite sw@@ aps here . &quot;

how Sri Lanka is dealing with the worst floo@@ ding of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and land@@ slide catastrophe in this decade .
&quot; triggered by the mon@@ soon , which normally starts at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ err@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya took over the banks in 15 districts in the south and west of the country . &quot;
&quot; according to an opinion of the disaster centre of Sri Lanka from May 28 , 2017 , 126 people were killed and scar@@ cely hundreds of people are missing because of the floods and slu@@ dges . &quot;
&quot; more than 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100,000 people have been brought to 30@@ 4 safe locations . &quot;
&quot; the rain falls on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water levels in some areas were slowly coming back . &quot;
health and hygiene conditions of the population are a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the magnitude of the flood disaster :
high water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama town with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates to flood situations .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .
&quot; Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods wor@@ sen the crisis of the Den@@ gue , warns Save the Children after further rainf@@ alls are already underway . &quot;
&quot; this morning the N@@ hat@@ wa bus stood in the high water , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also flooded due to the water level of the Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a . &quot;
the Air Force has provided five planes for rescue operations and another five are completed for the transport of emergency deliveries for the residents included in their flooded villages .
also various organizations and startups have agreed to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood conditions and humanitarian aid .
&quot; if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 . &quot;
for all who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -
today we are in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
&quot; if you need help in this field , please call 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 . &quot;
&quot; the taxi @-@ call app Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the app , so that the Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ en@@ entrum will be informed . &quot;
&quot; last year after the disaster of the Ro@@ an@@ u tropical storm , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; flood aid &quot; button that allowed users to call a vehicle for retri@@ eval of assistance and donations . these were then distributed free of charge to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross . &quot;
&quot; they also led a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; button , which resulted in more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for people who were drow@@ ned by floo@@ ding and land@@ slides . &quot;
&quot; the combined efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring people in need of need and help support . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of other lives , while Sri Lanka &apos;s population now faces the long way to restoring norm@@ ality . &quot;

&quot; the Women &apos;s March on January 21 , 2017 in San Francisco . &quot;
photo of Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
&quot; in January , I joined the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and love friend . &quot;
&quot; I entr@@ ust her to her four year old daughter , she entru@@ sts me to her children ; she is my rock in the br@@ anding . &quot;
&quot; in one minute , we call for slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights . &quot;
in the next we channel rights for trans@@ gender .
&quot; we are in a sea of umbr@@ ellas and people , some hold the iconic picture of a woman with head@@ sc@@ arf height , tied out of an American flag , others chant slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says : &quot; &quot; these things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already managed this conversation .
&quot; people with whom I work or people , who know me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built up in their imagination . &quot;
they are being Muslim .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims around the world .
we do not all look alike .
we practice our religion differently .
&quot; we identify ourselves to be a Muslim , in different ways . but somehow we are all plu@@ gged into the same Muslim thrust . &quot;
&quot; this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination , that as soon as Muslims , which as I do not fit in , are Muslim . &quot;
need to be Muslim
I am not alone .
&quot; this is even the poet , whose poetry is most widely sold in America : Rum@@ i . &quot;
what images come to mind when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; when Jal@@ alu@@ d@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I was now , he was an Orthodox Muslim Pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Koran , and Prophet Muhammad , were the center of his poetry until the day he died . &quot;
&quot; but in the Western idea , the religion of Rum@@ is was extingu@@ ished , as well as the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
this del@@ eting makes a large part of the story of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world .
another exists in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist pictures of Muslims who have been colon@@ izing Western books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
&quot; in the 1970s , the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid destroyed the story behind these images . &quot;
but these pictures stand still further today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to ste@@ er them . &quot;
&quot; I have worked in the news industry for thirteen years and I have seen how these powerful , defective nar@@ rations dominate our news@@ feeds . &quot;
&quot; this tri@@ pod sur@@ passes the reality that has led nine Muslim women to their countries in the last three decades , while the United States may not even choose their first female presidential candidate . &quot;
&quot; this narrative fails to recognise that when French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings and forcing Saudi Arabian Muslim women to cover their entire body , these are both sides of the same coin . &quot;
a powerful group exercises its &quot; control &quot; on the &quot; other . &quot;
this strong Nar@@ r@@ ative weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements for change .
&quot; it sees that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans , who were hi@@ jack@@ ed with slave ships . &quot;
it del@@ etes the existence of que@@ er Muslims .
&quot; this narrative has filled our collective imagination in such a deep and er@@ ron@@ eous manner , that often Si@@ kh @-@ men and children become the target of anti @-@ militar@@ ist attacks and ch@@ ic@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; because of these stories that we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
to the 1.7 billion belong
&quot; in the news industry , we do more than tell stories based on facts . &quot;
or on alternative facts .
we also create narr@@ atives that help us understand the world .
and my industry has f@@ lar@@ ed down to record the Nar@@ r@@ ative of the 1.7 billion .
&quot; and we have failed to find out where seven million Muslims constitute the &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot;
more than a third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ armed Americans .
&quot; six of the ten American Muslims belong to the first generation immigrants , who come from 77 countries . &quot;

four decades ago my immig@@ rated parents arrived in New York to live their American dream .
&quot; my mother placed her first jewellery design on 5th Avenue before and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American st@@ ati@@ st from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan . &quot;
&quot; back then , when Khan was re@@ thinking the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were un@@ miss@@ able Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I now a Muslim and an American woman ?
&quot; sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of getting my Muslim recipes out or carrying out my hand@@ some hand@@ ker@@ chiefs , all Muslims - &quot; out of respect for P@@ epp@@ a W@@ utz . &quot;
&quot; I j@@ est , we don &apos;t carry all hand@@ ker@@ chiefs with us . &quot;
we also need to be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be selected almost always for additional security checks at the airport .
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists trying to combat widespread lies about Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced by a well @-@ lubri@@ cated Islam@@ opho@@ bia machine with fin@@ ders , think tanks and experts for mis@@ information that our already faulty image of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in more than just a stranger who breaks down a woman &apos;s head@@ sc@@ arf . &quot;

I want to explain this .
&quot; I was born as a Muslim but a Muslim has only been born into my imagination when I was four years old , in a temporary mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York . &quot;
&quot; when social scientists describe religious life , they refer to the following terms : belief , behaviour and belonging . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith and behaviour may not always be visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbors , my neighbors , my rock in the surf , would see that I am a Muslim when she could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot;
&quot; she would see the evening ritual with my daughter , when I kept her in my arms and whis@@ pered to her the Arabic verses for protection , which seal the Koran and be called the Q@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
each of them I repeat three times .
&quot; I ask that they are protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim community is always part of my shadow . &quot;

belonging is the picture of my grandmother in the mat@@ ernal side with her sisters ; how she would win a competition of art of flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi for decades .
&quot; it is the picture of her that I will see at this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her completed and un@@ finished paintings painted Su@@ fi @-@ saint ; and a Qur &apos;an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters that it can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze . &quot;
to be Muslims means to speak the prayers they told me when I have a bad day .
&quot; to be Muslims is how they taught me to relate to God : God Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people who - for centuries - been colon@@ ized by an &quot; &quot; empire &quot; &quot; founded by a company named Ven@@ erable British East In@@ dies Company , it has a deep meaning to call God , my only Lord . &quot;

&quot; belonging to me means to grow up and to hear that men do not cry , but at the same time see that my immig@@ rant grandfather we@@ ep . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , while he writes books on modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana Ja@@ an wept for his family in the K@@ ash@@ mir family , which he was not allowed to close in half a century . &quot;
&quot; belonging to it is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , like my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have divided the Muslim world as at stake . &quot;
to be Muslim means knowing that in the last two centuries Europeans have &quot; colon@@ ized &quot; all up to four Muslim countries .
it means knowing that the first pilot &apos;s bom@@ ber of history was dropped over a Muslim country in front of a century ago .
&quot; it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , c@@ ash@@ mere sub@@ tan of the British Empire , was called &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time as he led the first mosque in England . &quot;
&quot; before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;

to belong to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion goes deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ acknowledged history .
&quot; it means remembering that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops scattered across every continent apart from the Antar@@ ctic , went into Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist . &quot;
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried beneath the rub@@ ble of the war .
to be an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
&quot; it means knowing that when a tragedy comes to the US and the suspect carries a Muslim name , history is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago , the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liberated black slaves with the name Bil@@ al . &quot;
it means knowing that two hundred years ago an African Islamic schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country .
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the heat that I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim Ban .
it is the hope I feel when we get up for our dreams and when we say black life counts .
&quot; being an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Muslim and a journalist , means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple facets , but fail to communicate them to others . &quot;
&quot; the tri@@ l@@ ative of the 1,7 billion ent@@ ails more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the reduced ambig@@ u@@ ity &quot; we &quot; against &quot; it . &quot; &quot;
&quot; being a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people er@@ ect structural anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility . &quot;
structural anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility exists in Muslim registr@@ ations that began with President Bush and extended under President Obama .
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
&quot; it consists in the immigration officer , who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
it is in a country that exclu@@ des its borders to people from just the countries that it bom@@ bed .
&quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ fly list , &quot; which is mostly targeted by Arabs and Muslims . &quot;
&quot; it is the wars that we lead , and the bombs we cast into Muslim countries . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from the Nor@@ th@@ western University showed a scientifically wrong picture and asked them to assess groups on a scale of 1 to 100 regarding evolution . &quot;
Muslims received the lowest score .
the conversation we have to lead
we are too deep to enth@@ use the Muslim or the &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; we are back for decades to recognize the roots of our fears , and the er@@ ron@@ eous and dangerous impression that we put in our news editors . &quot;
&quot; at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history . &quot;
&quot; the pod@@ cast lake Som@@ e@@ thing , Sa@@ y Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ Feed ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ elo Square over black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Sho@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to increase Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IS@@ TA@@ N@@ IS@@ CH , Muslim , American super hero@@ ine - all this gives me hope . &quot;

but I am concerned about this difficult global timing in which we are .
and this moment has consequences which go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is one reason that conspiracy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the internet now lead the White House .
they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; a few years earlier , they had not yet given them ; now they are domin@@ ating large areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot;
&quot; I am concerned about the realities and the history that I was not aware of when I was as old as it is my daughter , but who today have made me an irre@@ ver@@ sible Muslim . &quot;

&quot; we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of this , consciously and un@@ consciously rep@@ j@@ uring the &quot; others &quot; ; as it is my girlfriend and myself in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the occupation that we have no president , the chocolate cake , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot;
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art wants to preserve urban language diversity
&quot; story telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r users Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 . &quot;
can there be a possibility here and now in connection with someone in spite of a language barrier ?
&quot; Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , the founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling initiative ( T@@ LS ) , is a possible answer to the number of stories in their original language . &quot;
&quot; recently , Global Vo@@ ices reported on a different initiative by Steven Bird , the un@@ riv@@ alled blog . &quot;
&quot; here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the diversity of languages of large cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in O@@ ak@@ land in the United States where T@@ LS has already conducted events since 2015 , the risk that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there . &quot;
the following applies to the makers of the project :
&quot; the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities , accept diversity - secure spaces in which people don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong . &quot;
&quot; while &quot; listening often is linked to understanding &quot; these events , instead , &quot; listening to appreciate , feel , soci@@ alize . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers represent their history first in their own language and translate or explain them in English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants are not a professional story t@@ eller , their devotion and their representation ent@@ ail that the audience is insi@@ sting on it . &quot;
&quot; they call forth laughter and emotions , as the language is no longer a barrier . &quot;
&quot; the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language of Daf@@ ing . during this turn , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical of her country . &quot;
&quot; in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ o@@ ara tells the f@@ ables of the rab@@ bit and the bab@@ o@@ ons in the language of Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe : &quot;
&quot; after explaining the meaning of his f@@ ables , John Ny@@ am@@ on@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is this to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in he shares his sense of inclu@@ si@@ veness : &quot;
you have listened to !
they were attentive ...
they were with me !
&quot; until now , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organisers hope to extend it . all who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own story narrative . &quot;
Puerto Rico ur@@ ges the US to re @-@ establish sovereign debt
&quot; with the aim of a re@@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounted to 72 million US dollars , various religious and civil organisations took part in a mass demonstration last 3 April 2017 ; the march started at the Mexican Cap@@ it@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went to the Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the old town of San Ju@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; it was sum@@ mon@@ ed by the group &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ Ã­a de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Ci@@ tiz@@ ens front for the ne@@ ural checking of debt ) , and the church meeting of Puerto Ri@@ cos . &quot;
the advoc@@ ates of the re@@ fixing of debt also filed a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos require that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for debts are held responsible for their corruption . &quot;

&quot; the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continue to campaign for his freedom and remind of the contributions he has made for an open net . &quot;
&quot; this year &apos;s re : Pub@@ lica , the annual conference on the digital culture that is hosted in Berlin , dedicated itself to the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign . &quot;
&quot; MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ nay , a scientist of the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ Ã¼h@@ ling , managing director of Book S@@ prints , a publisher of books produced by so @-@ called &apos; Book S@@ prints &apos; , read excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive Inqu@@ iry ( The Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive After@@ market ) . &quot;
&quot; the book , which was published last year and is available roy@@ alty free here , contains a series of essays dealing with free culture in the face of oppression . &quot;
it is a tribute to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it is called :
&quot; this book aims to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built up , and what are the real costs associated with it . &quot;
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news@@ feeds and to create some sense of our different experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to liber@@ ate Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012 . &quot;
his name was removed from the directory of the A@@ dra prison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
&quot; since then , we have no information about his current state or where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; the introductory part of his book , entitled &quot; &quot; Collec@@ tive Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce &quot; &quot; gives his friends and his family a voice calling for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom . &quot;
&quot; seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have let us start thinking about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , actions and decisions . &quot;
why are we here today ?
what did we choose ?
what have we given up in this process of occasionally extreme convic@@ tions ?
the web developer for Open Source and Digital activ@@ ist has been in the custody of Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
&quot; in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution , to an unknown location . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; military police &quot; had taken part in A@@ dra as a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military tribunal in A@@ dra . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i reported that on November 12 , 2015 , they were contacted by persons who presented themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad administration and informed them of an alleged death sentence against their husband . &quot;
&quot; however , his where@@ ab@@ outs and condition remain unknown . &quot;
&quot; a pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in extending access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project called Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
perhaps none of Bas@@ le &apos;s cultural prototypes was more for@@ e@@ ward than the work that he began with a group of arch@@ e@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ roads of numerous civi@@ lizations and here f@@ use Greek @-@ Roman architectural models with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; at that time Bass@@ el could not know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would put everything on it , this architecture that em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world . &quot;
this journey into digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule which will be inv@@ aluable for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
&quot; tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el could not finish this project yet . &quot;
&quot; N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison : &quot;
I spent my whole life of dre@@ aming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
&quot; Bass@@ el taught me English , even when he was already in jail . &quot;
&quot; I have learned to read , write and speak English well . &quot;
&quot; he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked . he taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English . &quot;
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
&quot; he also taught other prisoners how to use computers , at least theoretically without actually holding one in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of waiting ( waiting ) , a prof@@ ess@@ orship that she wrote to her husband in 2012 and 2015 when he was in custody . &quot;
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together on the book for one year .
she smu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic to English .
the book is available roy@@ alty free .
book cover by Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to public domain .
here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a titled &quot; It happens &quot; :
&quot; it happens during each visit , &quot;
&quot; that I sink in the world of your charming eyes , &quot;
&quot; that I lose the reflection in the moment we embrace , &quot;
&quot; that every danger doesn &apos;t matter to me , &quot;
&quot; each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guards &quot;
I forget the crow@@ ding of the prison
and I enter every detail of your voice and words
&quot; that I bear with passion with me , &quot;
when your eyes bid farewell
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
&quot; I return quickly to my lon@@ el@@ iness , &quot;
&quot; to bring back all the moments , &quot;
and to cry and smile about your absence .
I persu@@ ade myself that I will return soon ...
&quot; on the first anniversary of the detention of Bass@@ el , G@@ haz@@ i wrote : &quot;
&quot; a year passes , my soul &quot;
while at the same time
&quot; I am in your cage , &quot;
and you are still in the cage of monsters
Bas@@ le &apos;s story is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) . &quot;
those who were arrested or disappeared under violence by the regime were tortured or even executed .
&quot; by 2016 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International , at least 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have died in prison since 2011 . &quot;
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
today we repeat our demand in the hope that we must do this for the last time .
&quot; Mozambique : convic@@ ted , convic@@ ted of corruption , after release on previous post &quot;
&quot; with anger he re@@ acted to a corruption case in which a government member returned to the workplace in the state apparatus after half of his sentence , in which the corruption was committed . &quot;
&quot; this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison in 2010 along with four other defend@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; the money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique , whose advice was given by Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately called for his re @-@ adjustment to the company , which happened on April 19 . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic who rejected the request , there would be no obstacle for Cam@@ ba@@ za to re @-@ refer his old post , as the company did not carry out disciplinary proceedings after his detention . &quot;
&quot; however , many inhabitants do not mean the action well . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with Deutsche Welle , the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Int@@ egri@@ da@@ de P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica , C@@ IP ) condemned the company &apos;s decision to re @-@ establish the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards in view of the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot;
what we are aware of is that the company should also have initiated a disciplinary procedure against the contrary .
&quot; the company , however , seems to be silent and does not undertake appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , also re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case as &quot; res@@ ounding &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent guy , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of whom had dinner . &quot;
&quot; he could hold paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image . &quot;
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he has agreed to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped to inflic@@ t damage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is gladly paid for its silence . &quot;
disgu@@ sting !
&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil , says the director does not possess any moral : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state , because he insul@@ ted him . I can &apos;t believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that has so heavily insul@@ ted the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks morality and serves to serve the state , but has already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but has only served itself on the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as though it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money , and the state itself has become tired of this man who was accused and finally sentenced to a long prison term . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Fran@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ te prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , that a th@@ ief is in prison : &quot;
&quot; thi@@ eves are part of the Sam@@ ora Mah@@ el prison and will not only be remembered by the Mos@@ lem people as the first independent president , but also as a sharp , one @-@ ed@@ ged and - inci@@ dentally - prophes@@ ied . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral representations was when he vigor@@ ously confirmed that &quot; &quot; an ambitious man is capable of selling also the father@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora also said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious person changes , my experience shows that this is not so . he changes tactics but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions . &quot;
an ambitious person is criminal at the same time . &quot;
&quot; in Twitter , the reactions were also negative : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , and he was 10 years old and was released . &quot;
&quot; and today , the company , in which he rep@@ atri@@ ates money , res@@ umes again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - Ñ@@ Î±@@ Î»@@ Î¹@@ Î± ( @ az@@ mal _ Ra@@ fik ) May 12 , 2017 &quot;

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ors many users
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or spl@@ itting b@@ asses .
&quot; photo by San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Com@@ mons , Creative Com@@ mons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ ported &quot;
&quot; according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts from the network because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or &quot; &quot; Cal@@ ar &quot; &quot; ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese script ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely depreci@@ ative con@@ notation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; Kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be associated with racism , but the word itself does not automatically cause hate speech . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; many people have reported that even posts , in which they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubt for its use , have been cens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with different mean@@ ings that have the same character sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , chair on Bur@@ m@@ ese is also written &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( sp@@ litter b@@ se ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ gin A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post to one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he had asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way , if they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a pu@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the phrase &quot; &quot; cure &quot; &quot; ( ku ) + the question ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression very much , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were different reactions to the Facebook initiative .
&quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ tet believes that it will reduce hate speech by radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook should be more analytical just before all posts that are suspected of spreading racism . &quot;
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you write to Fac@@ be@@ ook .
&quot; what it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and control it by checking the words &quot; &quot; next &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists , who spread hate speech , get a pretty good lesson . &quot;
now it is time to circumc@@ ise its nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to all who hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long . &quot;
&quot; the experiences of social networks in China like S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the cens@@ orship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks simply begin to use a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views . &quot;
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to clear his posts when he only wanted to communicate his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was ban@@ ished from the social network :
&quot; when I became aware of this new policy from Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my post from Facebook was removed and I was not allowed to distribute the songs , posts and parts of content for 24 hours , because the post &quot; &quot; didn &apos;t meet the Facebook community standards &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
&quot; in the post , the author shared his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism are bad in the country . &quot;
&quot; Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example , the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community asking for advice : &quot;
&quot; Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce racism in Burma through its platform , but it does not work . &quot;
cens@@ oring such words will bring only more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems that they have started this without local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; pe@@ a cur@@ ry &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fal@@ si@@ fied Post@@ s . &quot;
&quot; if they only have a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that give them a big turnover , that would be great . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook &apos;s automatic cens@@ orship has caused much ridi@@ cu@@ le among users . &quot;
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the network . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts that did not contain any hate speech , but were nevertheless removed : &quot;
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ as cur@@ ry and watch an Indian movie .
just to try out if Facebook is removing the mail containing the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; screen@@ shot , used with permission . &quot;
&quot; the post states &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot; &quot;
&quot; screen@@ shot , used with permission . &quot;
&quot; over the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used social networks to expand their voices and influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate speech in social networks should also inc@@ ite violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in the Rak@@ h@@ ine area , where clas@@ hes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee . &quot;
&quot; for his failure , Facebook was critic@@ ised for his failure to take control of the frau@@ dul@@ ent hate speech on his Bur@@ m@@ ese parties . &quot;
&quot; but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &quot; Kal@@ ar , &quot; it would have been better to look at context rather than code concentrating initiatives and learned from them . &quot;
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago concludes with the chil@@ dr@@ ens &apos; marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .
&quot; Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC B@@ Y 2.0 . &quot;
the chil@@ dr@@ ens &apos; marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the parliament of the country unanim@@ ously approved a law that should prohi@@ bit this practice , so that the age @-@ old age is now 18 . &quot;
&quot; before this change of the marriage , some members held Hind@@ u and Muslim religious communities in practice , and in May 2016 there came to a large public out@@ cry . at that time , Brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere , as that age does not determine maturity . &quot;
&quot; this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago became a contract partner of the UN child rights convention , the min@@ ors as &quot; &quot; every man under the age of 18 &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children who had been married to 15 in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago amounted to 2.8 percent , and with 18 it was 8.@@ 1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the statistical central office of the country confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married to 19 in 1997 @-@ 2007 . &quot;
&quot; online peti@@ tions and social media movements , aimed at abol@@ ishing laws for children &apos;s toe , followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring this result . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hind@@ u leader , for example , had no hes@@ itation to say to the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they should , to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition led to tensions in this actually un@@ complicated matter , and at some point doubts expressed whether the opposition would even agree to the draft bill . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of 2017 the bill was approved against the children &apos;s marriage - despite 4 Sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent one who ab@@ stained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him the law . &quot;
now only the president of the country has to appro@@ ve and declare the law .
one of the Sen@@ ators of the country gave a status update on Facebook which again posted Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ ag@@ ram :
&quot; Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ res@@ at : the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was voted in the House of Represent@@ atives , with 35 votes for this and no one against it . &quot;
&quot; after it was previously decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law . &quot;
the majority of the social media users were thrilled because the laws for children were finally changed .
&quot; member of Facebook , Lo@@ vel@@ l Francis , who is a minister of ministry in the Ministry of Education , said : &quot;
&quot; it took too much time and unnecessary talk that disgu@@ ised the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the children &apos;s toe is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that is worth almost any price . &quot;
&quot; while Abel Jackson was the opinion , it took long enough to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ al @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day finally came : &quot;
&quot; public Status Update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ al - Thomas , which states : &quot;
the Act has been decre@@ ed .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ ota , belonging to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was , noted : &quot;
the age of old in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
&quot; the draft for the amendment of the marriage network was approved today , June 9 , 2017 . &quot;
&quot; in the House of Represent@@ atives there are 41 de@@ pu@@ ties , 35 of whom were present during the vote . &quot;
&quot; all de@@ pu@@ ties , who were against , voted for the law . &quot;
the chil@@ dr@@ ens &apos; marriage is no longer permitted in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long struggle ( ... ) # child@@ boy &apos;s shiel@@ ds .
many thanks to all activists who challenged him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our MEPs .
&quot; but a possible hook comes in the form of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the country &apos;s most famous Hind@@ u organization . &quot;
&quot; months ago , Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to take legal steps , the law should be passed and he seems to be his promise . &quot;
&quot; while the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al ra@@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , said it was quite legitimate if Mahar@@ aj wanted to act against the law , most social media users wished to address the debate on the subject . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rel@@ l suggested :
&quot; dear Sat , if we , instead of talking so generally , in a way that would only invite panic and dis@@ grace , if we would like to invite the state into our bedrooms , &quot; just pur@@ pos@@ efully talk about that the state , our daughters guard against it , would be ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ sm@@ elling men , who are opposed to them , &quot; would you then be prepared to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
&quot; however , whether it comes to a judicial action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where children are legal or still the norm in different gra@@ dations , although there are laws which they prohi@@ bit . &quot;

&quot; for over a month now Turkey has been blocking the popular and based en@@ cyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia , based on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle . &quot;

&quot; although many technically experienced Internet users are used to using b@@ ypass tools for blocked websites ( a current article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ valence in the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been blocking Wikipedia articles since 2008 , as was recently described in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ages of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Act ( no . 56@@ 51 ) was adopted . &quot;

&quot; while the platform continues to be blocked , there are now several mirrors ( pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and often updated ) . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , as the platform put all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centralized Peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( i.e. computer calcul@@ ator connections ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult . &quot;
&quot; the content is , in spite of legal prohibition , however available . &quot;
&quot; in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about his efforts : &quot;
&quot; after listening to the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we put everything in place to take snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , it is possible to read the contents in a distributed and distributed way . &quot;
&quot; this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia contents , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org themselves . &quot;
IP@@ FS also announced that this step was carried out independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia @-@ Foundation and it is merely screen@@ shots and not live or dynamic versions of the website .
&quot; however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to b@@ ypass the lock . &quot;
&quot; Cr@@ istian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has produced both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ zz@@ pedi@@ .org , an M@@ irr@@ or@@ page from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirrors , when Wikipedia is banned in the respective country . &quot;
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i - Global Vo@@ ices member as well as employees at Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; pod@@ cast :
&quot; it is not a complete copy of a proxy address , a mirror . &quot;
you access another URL that is not the original . that what you see then is from Wikipedia .
&quot; essentially , the server sends the request to the right Wikipedia page , making it possible to see Wikipedia &apos;s contents even if they are locked in Turkey . &quot;
this is done by a server not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature conservation
&quot; a bow@@ ing r@@ hin@@ o , Ch@@ it@@ wan . &quot;
photo of Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
&quot; Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were blur@@ ry with poorly positioned motifs , and washed colours . &quot;
this motivated him to carry a camera with him and try to strai@@ gh@@ ten the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring N@@ ept@@ une to the international scene . &quot;
&quot; and his hom@@ etown next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to N@@ ept@@ une wildlife . &quot;
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ class situation in his work helps him :
&quot; I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! ! &quot;
&quot; I just rested at home when Navar@@ aj suddenly called me ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had received a call from my father that on the shore of the Rap@@ ti River , a le@@ op@@ ard would be . &quot;
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in just a few minutes .
my father watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the le@@ op@@ ard was located and I immediately started to kne@@ el pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
&quot; and he should know &#91; it &#93; , for he was standing up to tig@@ ers face to face : &quot;
a tiger can not distur@@ b himself from the opinion of the sheep while sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleep time for all animals and birds .
&quot; also I was home because of the darkness on the way home , when the King of the Bu@@ k suddenly appeared . he immediately sat down , we see ourselves and he star@@ es me through the sc@@ arf @-@ trees ! ! &quot;
&quot; in order to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot;
&quot; his passion for promoting N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s nature and wildlife is , however , not always easy . &quot;
he waited for 22 days and lived mostly in a tent to take photographs of Ot@@ tern in Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodation .
see below some of these photos .

&quot; years after the marriage , Indian women dare to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands &quot;

&quot; this entry was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ st and was originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India . &quot;
a revised version was once again published as part of a content sharing agreement .
&quot; in many parts of India women avoid speaking with the greatest care , the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family . &quot;
&quot; instead , they use a pron@@ ou@@ n or &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h women admit that due to social pressure they should respect the husband , as well as the fear of the consequences , they should dis@@ regard the norm , this practice in life . &quot;
&quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto from the Indian State of O@@ dish@@ a was convic@@ ted by a false court and viol@@ ated by her family and the village community , after she had addressed a married relative with names . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of nam@@ ing their wives is also common among men . however , they have far fewer privileges to fear , if any , they should not follow this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the P@@ une district , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , among them health personnel , and house@@ wives , performed a unique club , thus quickly became the main theme of the city . &quot;
it is a place only for them alone where they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
&quot; as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , he is part of the # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al campaign , which is run by the community of Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and is committed to the disman@@ tling of the patri@@ archy . &quot;
&quot; for seven years , Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was has been working with the help of her video camera to expose practices such as children &apos;s marriage to the exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and leads these clubs . &quot;
it tells how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambass@@ adors of change .
&quot; the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion , acted by women who did not name her hus@@ bands . &quot;
she chose this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which the women could easily identify .
&quot; not to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands lou@@ dly , it is a custom which they all committed du@@ ly and never questioned . &quot;
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not hold this is considered as dec@@ eit@@ ful as a woman without mor@@ als .
tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about it until this discussion .
&quot; at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never named her husband by the name , wanted to try at home , as it runs . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini told :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was over .
&quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him by now on his name . &quot;
&quot; with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini started their first discussion . &quot;
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h . &quot;
&quot; after the video projection , the women tried to get the discussion going . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she all asked , &quot; &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us as they want , it means that they do not respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the names of their hus@@ bands to their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on the breaking of a centuries @-@ old tradition in which married women could never pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
Roh@@ ini told :
a woman was so shy that she was just ch@@ ick during the whole exercise ; another decided to release the whole devoted fru@@ stration against him and his family by cursed him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; still in the rush of adren@@ aline about having broken with an old custom , the women decided that they would actually try at home to name their hus@@ bands by their name . &quot;
and they kept their word .
&quot; in the coming days , Roh@@ ini received a large number of reports . &quot;
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put into her head : his wife couldn &apos;t stop telling his name .
another club member decided to do dinner before the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she was afraid and said it was a mistake . &quot;
&quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini told me to do it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation started violence .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports how women tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot on the forehead that shows the mar@@ ital status : &quot;
why do women only have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would wear the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot if he did it too .
he only laugh@@ ed and I stopped wearing him .
&quot; the other women have not completely ceased , but they think they are now in a better position to choose themselves , not to wear it in some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip at each point of the discussion . &quot;
&quot; normally , we pack up lunch and water and go out to the field . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear what &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; in the past few months , they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their lives ; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought of before . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things , for example how our identi@@ ties are attached to our hus@@ bands . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to be able to say certain things , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
&quot; in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honour and how it is connected to clothing . &quot;
some women in the group have only borne sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; for most people it &apos;s okay , but some wanted a Sal@@ man @-@ Kur@@ ta to wear a wide shirt over a pair of trousers ; they didn &apos;t dare . &quot;
&quot; after much debate and discussion about the mer@@ its of their own choice of clothes , morality associated with sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini ornam@@ ented their own pair of Kur@@ tas ( upper shirts ) in a round of discussions so that women could wear them . &quot;
next they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will do it .
&quot; on the question of whether the five months have already changed a little since their first discussion , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are slowly rolling : &quot;
we have only made small steps so far .
&quot; some women tried it a few times , but then stopped telling the name of her husband . &quot;
&quot; some , including me , do it yet , but only when they are alone and no other family members are there . &quot;
only one or two continue to say the names of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women are now wearing zinc red on their foreh@@ e@@ ads at any time .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the hag@@ gling for more freedom of movement or the choice of clothes - lie at the end of a hard to navigate river .
&quot; by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
how Roh@@ ini explained :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy .
I am also .
but this club gives each one of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when each woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we all sit in the same boat .

the first visit of the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a memorial day
the Beat@@ les at their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot from the official YouTube channel of the Beat@@ les .
&quot; on the 29th of June this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag of the &quot; &quot; H@@ ash@@ tag &quot; &quot; was to be found in the Japanese Twitter trend , where many fans shared memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les . &quot;
the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a revers@@ al in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war era .
&quot; the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ i@@ ko , who was exclusively inter@@ viewed by the Beat@@ les in London in 1964 , noted in 2016 on the occasion of the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit : &quot;
&quot; for just barely five days , the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through . &quot;
it became clear to the people here that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many known Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
&quot; the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , President of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review . &quot;
good morning ! today is the Beat@@ les memorial day in Japan .
&quot; also today , songs from the Beat@@ les are sung in Japanese kar@@ a@@ oke bars and in English classes at Japanese middle schools . &quot;
the kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les survi@@ ves everything .
today is the Beat@@ les memorial day .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; W@@ inn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll is supposed to represent John L@@ enn@@ on or not .
&quot; and as it is for fans , Japanese of course also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the known places connected with the band . &quot;
&quot; when you love the Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places that you absolutely have to visit &quot;
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fiel@@ ds ( memorial in New York )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
&quot; 5 ) ( From Link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool &quot;
the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges can sometimes not be bizarre enough :
good morning together .
today is the Beat@@ les memorial day .
&quot; today in 1966 , the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time . &quot;
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran through Abbey Road .
the same thing we did last year too .
&quot; and of course , some companies also use the fan community , such as this R@@ amen @-@ Shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! today is Beat@@ les memorial day . &quot;
and what could that be for a day ?
&quot; today I will listen to &quot; &quot; Y@@ ester@@ day &quot; &quot; and eat R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya . &quot;
so the day will go today .
so we hope you &apos;re there !

bald men are dra@@ gged and killed in Mozambique
the police of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia warned the population that bald men could be in Mozambique target of attacks .
&quot; photo : different Bol@@ in / Fli@@ ck@@ r , CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 &quot;
&quot; a new system of kidn@@ apping of bald persons for the organ trade , probably for dis@@ believing purposes , worried the police of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called a series of operations to stop the practice . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ lier , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi . &quot;
one of the victims was be@@ headed and part of the organs were taken from .
two men were arrested and subsequently found that the organs of sham@@ ans were used in Tanzania and Malawi .
&quot; there is a local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a bald man could reveal gold or bring wealth , the police spokes@@ man of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia of the BBC declared . &quot;
it is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique .
&quot; another group , the goal of assass@@ inations for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot;
this led to the fact that the UN 2016 in South Africa conducted a mission to investigate this practice .
&quot; the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in neighbouring countries of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to combat this super@@ sti@@ tion and prejudi@@ ce . &quot;
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the town of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who plan to travel to the country :
&quot; attention to k@@ ah@@ le men , who travel to Mozambique , target ritual attacks , warned the Muslim police for the latest kill@@ ings of three bald men based on their parts of the body . &quot;
&quot; two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ lier , where the kill@@ ings took place . &quot;
&quot; Hus@@ sene Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Mozambique , said that the local police are already following the case : &quot;
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
&quot; persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ ru@@ mb@@ ala , province of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , for probably dis@@ believing rituals , has given cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , which also indicates that faith exists , according to which the victims in the head might have power , generating wealth . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , three men with hair loss problems have been killed in this part of the country . &quot;
Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ anth@@ a gave on Facebook the chron@@ icle of the poor man Sn@@ ai@@ ppa explaining that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique :
&quot; I like M@@ Ã@@ CH@@ TE like AN mos@@ ques , DAS S@@ ME ashamed a country in which people would have shame to go to the street as if they would be ashamed of taking pictures of a por@@ no@@ graphic in which the teachers would be ashamed to earn their bread , a country in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or black magic would be hun@@ ted to get to fast wealth . &quot;
&quot; despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some of the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ ren humor could not be missed . &quot;
&quot; Zen@@ aida Mah@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic Twitter user twe@@ et@@ ers twe@@ et@@ ete that both the head of the Mor@@ ru@@ mb@@ ala district , Pedro S@@ app@@ ange and the police spokes@@ man Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zi@@ as , In@@ Ã¡@@ cio D@@ ina , are both bald : &quot;
the Muslim authorities are very worried about the assass@@ inations of bald people .

we are deeply affected by the death of our friend Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il .
&quot; we mo@@ urn for him and speak our deeply sincere con@@ dol@@ ences to his family , friends and all those who have known him and loved him . &quot;
&quot; a pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria , actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) played a key role in expanding public access to the Internet and Open Knowledge . &quot;
he was a close friend of many from the Global Vo@@ ices community and participated in our meeting of Arabian blo@@ g@@ gers in 2009 .
&quot; in November 2015 , Bas@@ le &apos;s wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she was contacted by persons who spend himself as insi@@ ders of the Assad government . &quot;
&quot; they reported that her husband was sentenced to death , but gave no further information . &quot;
Bas@@ ques Sta@@ y and Constitution were unknown until today ( 01 August 2017 ) when N@@ our@@ a of Syrian officials knew that he was executed in 2015 .
&quot; today and in the future , we will be honored by Bass@@ el &apos;s work as a pioneer of the open web movement . &quot;
and we appreciate the efforts of all the people and organisations who have been campaig@@ ning for his release over the last five years .
&quot; since 2011 and the start of the protests against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared , so the organisation of the Syrian Network for Human Rights has disappeared . &quot;
&quot; countless of those arrested by the regime , or enforced by force , are subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions . &quot;
&quot; between 2011 and 2016 no less than 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have died in custody , so the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International . &quot;
the fate of many people remains unknown .

&quot; free Bass@@ el : citizen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New reactions from the international community to the medical treatment of Nobel Prize lau@@ re@@ ates and dis@@ sident Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o &quot;
&quot; a photo by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably made just recently . &quot;
&quot; this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 in Hong Kong Free Press . &quot;
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized due to liver cancer during the final stage .
&quot; in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion , &quot; following the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o calling for democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Li@@ us case as an &quot; &quot; internal affair &quot; &quot; and a spokes@@ man says he did not consider it &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this affair with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , China continues to receive calls from the international community , the Nobel Prize winner and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , to release or allow him a treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the pair in Beijing , others have completely wi@@ ped out the issue . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has summ@@ arized some reactions from abroad .
unified nations
&quot; time R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure in order to allow Li@@ u abroad to be treated . &quot;
Norway and Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Br@@ ende refused to answer questions about his release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway came to a halt after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
&quot; diplomatic relations continued until December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon exports to China , as the exports had largely been blocked since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; after the news had spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his prize . &quot;
&quot; during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair . &quot;
European Union
&quot; on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to release Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance where he wants . &quot;
&quot; the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for the release of Li@@ us , as announced in a statement on 30 June : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect China to lift all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us wife and family members . &quot;
&quot; they should meet and receive all the visits they wish , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot;
United States of America
&quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told that the Americans wanted him to have the opportunity for treatment abroad , in so far as he helped him with his recovery . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced AF@@ P on June 27 that the embassy asked the Chinese authorities to not only release Li@@ u , but also to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the US embassy requests a fur@@ ious response from China , with the Foreign Ministry &apos;s statement that &quot; &quot; no country has the right to interfere and make ir@@ responsible comments about Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley announced that China should offer the couple the following :
&quot; protection and freedom , such as travel freedom and access to the medical care of his choice , to which they claim according to the Chinese constitution and legal system and international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the US sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also adopted a resolution in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally . &quot;
I urge China to release the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condition@@ ally so that he can go into proper medical treatment . htt@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany in the United States
&quot; German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on 3 July , Berlin hopes that Li@@ u &quot; receives all the medical support he needs &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot;
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping was published on 7 and 8 July at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
&quot; previously , diplomatic sources in Beijing told Reu@@ ters news agency that China had major concerns whether the vor@@ tex around Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg . &quot;
Canada - Canada
&quot; on 28 June , the Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um asked China to provide adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ us lawyer previously told AF@@ P that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always supervis@@ es the room in the hospital and that it is not permitted to talk to someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um goes on telling :
&quot; Canada calls on China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and to allow for the exercise of these rights . &quot;
France and France
&quot; in an Declaration on 29 June , the French Foreign Ministry invited China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons : &quot;
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all treatments he , regardless of where , needs . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact with him . &quot;
&quot; although the news channel France Info has already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information out whether France will eventually record it . &quot;
Taiwan in a nut@@ shell
&quot; on June 27 , the Council of continental issues in Taiwan called on China to release Li@@ u and show greater tolerance to those who use peaceful means to promote political reforms and democratic development . &quot;
&quot; the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legislature , Yu M@@ ei @-@ nu by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party , also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan . &quot;
Dalai Lama
&quot; the spiritual guide in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned about Li@@ u in an explanation on 28 June at Li@@ u and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ us well @-@ being . &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or country ?
&quot; the question may seem foolish , as Singapore is recognised as an independent state at an international level . &quot;
&quot; but according to the Minister of Justice , K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ z , Singapore should be considered a city . &quot;
this remark has spark@@ ed a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
&quot; during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the State of New York , the Minister re@@ marked that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of Singapore &apos;s only political party because it compared Singapore to other countries . &quot;
he supports that Singapore should be considered a city .
... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
&quot; that &apos;s it , most people make a mistake . &quot;
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; the blog of Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice , &quot; &quot; turning the logic &quot; &quot; in order to defend the authorit@@ arian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot;
&quot; and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land , one hears that we are ultimately not a country . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , whose land is it ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ ag@@ gam were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in the face of that , it inevitably appeared un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities like Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently guided by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; as soon as one reaches the core of the subject , the good old corp@@ se emerges from the authorit@@ arian rulers who pre@@ tend to be democr@@ ats , leaving the twisted logic , as it is better suited to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the end , the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ z gave answers to his American guests about our press , our judicial system , our political system really non @-@ responses . &quot;
he disgu@@ ised the corresponding questions with non @-@ answers in a rational way .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls on Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ ff to clear his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow .
&quot; when Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country belongs our city ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I don &apos;t understand anything . &quot;
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ ck would take the trouble to clarify this point if he was paid highly to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
&quot; by publishing his comments on the blog , he points out the critics about the fact that one should start reading the entire tran@@ script of the conference so that one could better understand the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country . &quot;
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; when he said that Singapore was more a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he explained why the Singapore elections were so un@@ important even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot;
he compared Singapore to cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; when he said Singapore , &quot; Be not a country , &quot; he obviously did not mean it in this sense ! &quot;
&quot; C@@ lement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ ff , who as leader of a growing generation , makes such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement . &quot;
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said ...
&quot; at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , what I expect - whether I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ ck , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes it is really associated and aware of what he def@@ ends . &quot;
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review dis@@ integrates the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ z celebrate &quot; &quot; good faith &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian slip ? &quot;
&quot; when Singapore is not a country , we are regarded only as an independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , what country do the sovereign rights of Singapore go back ? &quot;
Singapore is unique ; it is equally country and city .
&quot; since he plays an important role within the government cabinet , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam are of grave importance . &quot;
&quot; why do the people of Singapore afford their military service , but do they only defend their city but not their country ? &quot;
who must re@@ pay our prime minister invoices ?
what is the value of our pink ID card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade tends to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore , and was always a city : &quot;
I didn &apos;t say what I said ...
this sentence seems to have anno@@ yed many people of Singapore ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we were always a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; the defense of the country especially &quot; etc . , but that is not quite right . &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .
the My@@ th of the &quot; cute Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
&quot; recently , Global Vo@@ ices asked his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home country or home country ? &quot;
&quot; your answers will be published here as part of an ongoing series , with ru@@ mo@@ urs about certain parts of the world exposed and another fac@@ et is to be shown . &quot;
&quot; the latest part of this series is from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
&quot; the question , most asked to me in Japan , is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , I am sorry , &quot; &quot; I answer . &quot; &quot; I am from Canada . &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on the situation in which the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his conversation partner by asking personal questions . &quot;
&quot; my clari@@ fication mostly follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice hockey , nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans perhaps cook with anger in@@ war@@ dly when they are held for Americans , but I don &apos;t distur@@ b me . &quot;
&quot; for someone who doesn &apos;t know , there is little that distinguishes us Canadi@@ ans from Americans . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans get a Canadian flag clearly visible on their back@@ pack when they travel .
everyone loves Canadi@@ ans .
Americans on the other hand ... .
&quot; so it was already when I began travelling through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tru@@ mp , before the invasion of Iraq and 11 September . &quot;
Canadi@@ ans have always carried little map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care system !
there are no weapons with us !
marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
&quot; all seem to think , Canada is so great . &quot;
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; we obviously say very often &quot; &quot; excuse &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most tolerant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not like these guys south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
&quot; first of all , I have many American friends , which I admire very much . &quot;
it wouldn &apos;t matter to me if you would conf@@ use me with Johnny from Dallas for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
&quot; first of all , being called &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; means basically to be di@@ ligent - just like the ben@@ ign , gentle but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has a Canadian Doppel@@ gÃ¤n@@ ger ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada is really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , it would be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter . &quot;
being harmless means to be un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ interesting and to make no attention .
&quot; it can be a good thing if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far from the things that happen around you . &quot;
&quot; I would even go to say that the desire to be free and alone , is a main feature of the Canadi@@ ans . &quot;
we tend to care only for our own affairs .
&quot; what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy . &quot;
Canadi@@ ans do not often talk about the fence along with the neighbors .
&quot; we lack the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends . &quot;
thank@@ fully for us ( and for the rest of the world ) J@@ ustin Tru@@ deau betra@@ yed the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada down@@ right sexy .
music video of a pop band par@@ o@@ ding Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; a pop band celebrated in Thailand has published a music video that par@@ o@@ dic@@ ts the jun@@ ta , which took power in 2014 and , despite its promise to restore the civilian government , continue to rule the country . &quot;
&quot; the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tat@@ too Colour describes a young man who tells him , what regulations his girlfriend does . &quot;
&quot; although not explicitly political , the music video refers indirectly to the continuing military rule of the jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band has been praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the situation in the country .
the video to the song was a huge success .
&quot; within the first three days alone , the video uploaded on Facebook was 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8,@@ 800 songs . &quot;
&quot; last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists called on the public to watch this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , as well as the situation of the country under the jun@@ ta rule . &quot;
&quot; take a look at these videos of the video , referring to some of the political issues that Thailand has per@@ si@@ sted in the past three years . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; possibly relate to the dra@@ con@@ ic section 44 of the provisional constitution , which gives the supreme commander of the army an absolute decision making over important national issues . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious programme for &quot; setting up &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people seen as critics by the Jun@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; the image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a new unit was established in the army that over@@ sees online content and prosec@@ uted people who are accused of being slan@@ dered and prosec@@ uted . &quot;
Thailand sets a stri@@ k@@ ingly opposed to &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ esty &quot; ( Maj@@ estic insul@@ t ) .
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , martial law was declared in Thailand . &quot;
two days later it came to a coup d &apos;@@ Ã©@@ tat of the army .
&quot; one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money . &quot;
&quot; in the video , it is even shown how people are thrown into a black van before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society , and Internet users are threatened with long imprisonment , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , te@@ aser of the songs showed members of the band who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut of &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by coup opponents during the 2014 protests . &quot;
life continues in the ruins of the ghost towns in eastern Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia

&quot; the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with kind permission . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ war society only reco@@ vers very slowly in East Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; now more than 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ c war has been officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still strongly visible in this part of the Republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ cu@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
&quot; villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ i are located in the hydro@@ carbon basin of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups , such as Russians , Greeks , Asia Minor , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians , lived and worked in Soviet times in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
&quot; today , most of the Russians live in the area . &quot;
such settlements are also called ghost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period there were still more than 10,000 people living here , today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ cu@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the area amounted to 16@@ ,000 people after almost a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district . &quot;

&quot; all this is a consequence of the war &quot;
&quot; the empty five @-@ story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , which are called Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ uk@@ ow@@ ska , stand symbo@@ lically for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
&quot; the buildings are deca@@ yed , and very rarely they are inhabited by more than two families . &quot;

at the entrance of the village of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native elderly man .
he starts talking and it &apos;s hard for him to finish this .
&quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why am I talking ? &quot;
&quot; it is still un@@ ambig@@ uous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were communal centres , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens who served all the community . &quot;
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded magni@@ fic@@ ence buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have now left the district .
&quot; in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , about fifty inhabitants live . &quot;
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; K@@ hr@@ ush@@ ka , one or two families , can be seen on the balconies , where laundry is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they withdraw immediately . &quot;
&quot; our mother has forbidden us to take pictures , &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; she just banned us , that &apos;s all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly she leaves the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
&quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for personal needs ) , such as livestock breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable farming . &quot;
it &apos;s difficult to get over the rounds .
&quot; in winter , the district administration provides for free candles and bread to the villages . &quot;

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cch@@ ini &quot;
&quot; about ten years ago , an older woman named Gal@@ ina ( or A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a , as she is called in the neighborhood ) moved from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha . &quot;
&quot; despite her oldest daughter , who lives in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; my heart will forever stay in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , &quot; she tells . &quot;
Gal@@ ina does not want to receive financial help from her daughter and insist that she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly pension is just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very hard to survive , &quot; she says . &quot;
a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a tells that she and other villa@@ gers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
&quot; when vac@@ ations are , we visit us . &quot;
but we can &apos;t do it all the time - everybody is busy with his own problems . &quot;
&quot; as she tells her story , a younger neighbor appears on the balcony . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a calls her . &quot; they said we could build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;

Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
&quot; every day , it reminds of the village life before the war . &quot;
&quot; despite the relatives living in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia simply departed ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave it . &quot;

Nat@@ ascha receives about $ 9 children &apos;s money for each child .
her husband is working in the coal mine .
the young family has its own farm .
&quot; near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chi@@ ckens . &quot;

in Mexico &quot; Mama Africa &quot; accommo@@ dates migrants on their long journey
&quot; Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez heads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border from Mexico to Guatemala . &quot;
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and is published here with kind permission .
&quot; on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
&quot; I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located at the border to Guatemala . &quot;
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
&quot; it is led by a 59 @-@ year @-@ old Mexican woman , a little woman with a coral @-@ pink bri@@ ll@@ ard frame and gold @-@ coloured earrings in a ted@@ dy bear shape . &quot;
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there .
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a target for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
&quot; for about $ 2.@@ 50 the night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - but hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants come here .
&quot; sometimes , Mrs Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez nar@@ rates , the people come to full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to cry : &quot; &quot; mother Africa ! &quot;
where are you from Africa ? . &quot;
&quot; currently it is rather quiet , but this year , Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept on cardboard outside . &quot;
she doesn &apos;t want to refuse anyone .
&quot; she also helps them and brings her to the hospital when she is sick , she bu@@ ys medication that they can &apos;t pay , she mass@@ aging them with a bal@@ m that exhausted from the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ ch@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived a short time ago . &quot;
I asked him if Mama Africa was a reasonable nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
&quot; the Sebasti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a Yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t@@ bart ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez . &quot;
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
&quot; they have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard from other companions of M@@ om Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; says Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he tells that Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel together and that Afri@@ cans are already speaking about W@@ hat@@ s@@ app from Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
&quot; like many of his companions , Michel@@ et has lived in Brazil and worked as a construction worker on construction sites for the Olympic Games and the World Cup . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he began his journey to the United States . &quot;
he has been a guest at M@@ om Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will contact Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez in the future .
&quot; mother Africa is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; he answers smiling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells her guests often send her messages when she went to greet her or to report her about the course of her journey .
she declares that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
&quot; she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to cook chicken as in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez may be well known here , but she is not the only spark hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
&quot; at the other end of the city , a dead end leads to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have included migrants in their small house this winter .
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive .
&quot; he has begun to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his home for one dollar the night offered . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tians . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking station outside . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela declares that he knows what guests are going through .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they experience . &quot;
I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people can help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support .
&quot; after having lived for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants travelling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them . &quot;
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ do@@ va Mel@@ Ã©n@@ dez tells me he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children from people who wanted to black@@ mail money without having a plan .
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for accommodation and an unknown person , a single person , offered him a shelter . &quot;
&quot; a few months later , the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next step is to go . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests again .
&quot; in the corri@@ dors , travelers quietly consult their tel@@ eph@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; a mini@@ bus has arrived today and brought 20 new guests , most of them from Somalia . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone away . &quot;
&quot; like a proud grandmother , she leaves with numerous photos in her album . &quot;
&quot; there is one of her daughter with African hair spots , which you made a client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old . &quot;
she laughs sadly as she presents her briefly .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; she repeated every time . &quot; they have gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install a monitoring app on their mobile phones .
&quot; a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang by Twitter users , &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in western China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; on July 10 , the mobile users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of the city of U@@ rum@@ qi received a mobile phone notification in which it instruc@@ ts the district government to install a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; &quot; Web Cle@@ aning &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the message , it is said that the app will prevent access to terrorist information . &quot;
&quot; however , the authorities could also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ f@@ ecture , because they , shortly after they had installed the app , had exchanged messages with a private chat group . &quot;
&quot; the communication of the police states that the app would detect and prosec@@ ute the sources and distribution channels of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information , &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ Books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
&quot; J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om . &quot;
&quot; the main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic websites , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to alert users how much time they spend online , and to remotely control their home network . &quot;
this app with filtering for min@@ ors should help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could emp@@ ower state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal a person &apos;s home network . &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
&quot; while news about digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , crowded ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme ten@@ ures and surveillance measures as well as routine internet shut@@ downs . &quot;
&quot; the media outlet &quot; Images from mainland China &quot; ( such as &quot; &quot; Images from mainland China &quot; &quot; ) , which published cens@@ ored news in China , showed photographs of a check@@ point where polic@@ emen ass@@ aul@@ ted residents in@@ discrimin@@ ately whether they had installed the Surv@@ eillance App . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they may be imprisoned for up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
you have forced people to use devices that are meant for older people .
this is a form of captivity by the over@@ growth technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; &quot; &quot; images from mainland China &quot; &quot; ( as such ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description from which the software can lift the password requirements of a Windows operating system and thus receive un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot;
&quot; after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computer and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang will become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the Council &apos;s instructions to minim@@ ise the dis@@ semination of illegal content .
&quot; all branches , authorities and the party affiliated with the party , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office during the operation of their computers and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; an up @-@ to @-@ date Freedom House report , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , on June 27 , in a district of the regional capital of U@@ rum@@ qi , the authorities issued a regulation with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs until 1 August to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; at the local police . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist &quot; videos . however , this action viol@@ ates the personal rights of U@@ rum@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a number of other possible off@@ ences , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;
&quot; sleep or death , part 1 : everything cries out after death &quot;
one single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo by : Cor@@ rie B@@ ark@@ li@@ more ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
&quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far from our blue , virtual world you look at yourself and realize that you are all alone in a place where everything is important . &quot;
&quot; everything has gradually van@@ ished and revealed a truth that is clearly recognizable , both from the inside and from the outside . &quot;
one who gives honour to their name .
one who has put down in a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaph@@ ors .
&quot; but when the reality re@@ aps you and you look behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and the performer - the characters turn into beings of flesh and blood , and everything cries out after death . &quot;
&quot; all doubts settle in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even if the Earth continues on the axis of evil . you realize that you are trapped between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone around stone . &quot;
&quot; they have arrested me and my father three times , but that was not enough for me to &quot; learn my lesson , &quot; as the head of the Security Service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot;
he proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five teenagers were torn down during a peaceful protest as we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it was enough for the city to sh@@ atter the darkness of the night with &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; scre@@ ams .
&quot; all districts sought , only my own . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , it was quiet , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even though I didn &apos;t put any high demands on a city that is up to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; in the third night things had a little cal@@ med down , after the power supply stopped working in the neighborhood . &quot;
I interrupted the silence by scre@@ aming &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; several times from my house roof .
I listened to my voice through the silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to find together .
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined me , and we joined a magnificent picture that filled my expectations and completely fulfilled . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment , you are aware that you release the Spirit from the lamp , but it is simply not interested in the least . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet in the military security building . &quot;
he put on .
&quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swallow , nothing can give you back your voice after you scre@@ amed it all the way to the office of security service from the body . &quot;
I arrived there .
&quot; the Col@@ onel Gh@@ ass@@ an was there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I now . &quot;
&quot; the Col@@ onel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to say : &quot; let me hear you cry &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar , &quot; or you are only brave enough to scre@@ am if we are not close . &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes were directed to me .
&quot; and you &apos;re really gri@@ eving something , looking at my eyes and not on the ground ! &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I was standing in front of this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was due to my fol@@ ly , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution . &quot;
I was so sure of my cause when I answered : &quot; I wouldn &apos;t have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
&quot; and I think I &apos;ve never stopped looking into your eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret any word from what I said . &quot;
&quot; put him in solitary confin@@ ement , and his father immediately with it . &quot;
&quot; his father , just like that . &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cursed movement lies in my nose to this day .
&quot; he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a mental torture that I was subjected to for months . &quot;
I crossed the yard .
in the first office I leave everything I wear with me .
&quot; then again through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells . &quot;
I conc@@ eive all details exactly before I enter the room .
&quot; otherwise , they probably allocated a larger cell to me this time . &quot;
&quot; I have to share them with only one single prisoner , and I must immediately place myself without waiting for their permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I resor@@ ted to an established method of communication : to beat the fist against the wall . &quot;
&quot; I learned that my cell @-@ mate was a &quot; &quot; first prisoner &quot; . &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he finally answered me .
&quot; apparently in none of the surrounding cells lay a prominent middle @-@ aged man , who looks similar to me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the perfect darkness , no striking facial features can be seen on me , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all just numbers . &quot;
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice sounds similar to mine ? &quot;
all answers deny its existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
&quot; the investig@@ ator had assured me , they would release him if I remain . &quot;
li@@ ars .
&quot; I would like to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive away all these crow@@ s , which are lab@@ ori@@ ously lab@@ elled in the garden of my head . &quot;
&quot; from the distance , I still hear them scre@@ aming &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time , the cries vary , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black is the colour of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light telling us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; all@@ usion to the 13th S@@ ure of the Quran ) . &quot;
they are here to be heard .
&quot; thus the secret was lifted : to protect the security against us and prevent us from releasing the tra@@ itor and the terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dialect - so they played their denom@@ in@@ ational black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the narrow vision of their world view . &quot;
here is no house that is not a land ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their c@@ lans into a hero .
&quot; I was in charge of the audi@@ torium and meet at Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he seems to me that way . &quot;
&quot; he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , despite the facial expressions that will der@@ ail him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life as you join this diary and protest against demonstrations that will soon come to an end . &quot;
I did not answer .
I got used to it not to answer .
I can &apos;t say exactly when insul@@ ts and blows after a friendly conversation have become a common means of communication for me .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
&quot; some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished , even though I didn &apos;t do anything to earn this punishment . &quot;
in all their diversity .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls the aff@@ ection@@ ate confession .
it starts with a plastic pipe that probably comes from the clo@@ cks .
your hang@@ man rejo@@ ices in your cries .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him and you can &apos;t with@@ hold your cries . &quot;
&quot; my scre@@ ams were not enough for him yet , which is why they exchanged the pipe through a cable . &quot;
&quot; at my first arrest , I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator had worked as a garbage collector before or whether it belonged to the normal work equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had four cables inter@@ tw@@ ined to present us , from their point of view , great invention of a huge cable . &quot;
&quot; within a single hour three of them changed , while I was still in the series . &quot;
&quot; I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I listened to scre@@ aming . &quot;
&quot; the exec@@ ution@@ er re@@ marked the cooling and didn &apos;t take any pleasure in doing so , which is why he was next to an electrically loaded rod . &quot;
&quot; electricity flow@@ ed all my body , enough to store my whole neighborhood . &quot;
my half @-@ naked body lying on the ground was the perfect conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
&quot; some hours passed , which came to me like minutes . &quot;
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot;
&quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted youth : &quot; &quot; my Lord , my Father must be fear@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; be quiet and away , you will be moved . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always released me .
where do they lead me ? !
&quot; the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of the LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance &quot;
Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smoked a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time indoors ; sometimes he shu@@ ff@@ les to his screen , sometimes to his computer , and again to his couch . &quot;
but what you can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers or his lips stained with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
&quot; he lives in the upper@@ most floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel completed its occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family to flee their village in Palestine , in which they lived as fel@@ u@@ ye@@ es ( about : farmers ) . &quot;
&quot; for six years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who confron@@ ts the conservative majority and questioned her well @-@ established opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rape . &quot;
&quot; with his music , which often deals with topics such as orient@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . &quot;
&quot; with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not limited by limitations in his mind , and he can sympath@@ ise with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he does not admit it openly , he has a special reluct@@ ance against American foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ b looks at his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones , has something to do with his identity as a &quot; Palestinian prisoner of the second generation , &quot; he calls himself even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think of my own circumstances so , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b emphasizes . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I am a human , &quot; while he po@@ urs in water dissolved Nes@@ cafÃ© in two cups . it is the holy month Ram@@ adan ; in this time , it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
&quot; obviously H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a very hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
&quot; basically , the sm@@ elling of tep@@ id coffee and the wa@@ des of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air , especially if you take a look at the neighbouring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan to drink water - in order not to land in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently , the interior department of Jordan has cancelled a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time . &quot;
&quot; some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ osexual front singer Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country , and the main reason for the concert . &quot;
&quot; the MP and former spokes@@ man of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; had been cancelled because of sexual orientation of the singer . &quot;
&quot; many also argue that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which poses the tried @-@ and @-@ tested legi@@ timacy of authorit@@ arian regimes across the region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la estimated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who continue to choose &quot; intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this statement should probably not be simply shallow rhet@@ oric , but actually reflect a more and more clearly cryst@@ alli@@ zed reality in Jordan , which clearly appears in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b returned traditional lin@@ eage to Lei@@ be by completing his vision of the fate of Arab women who have mar@@ ital sex . &quot;
&quot; the picture shows the skel@@ eton of a woman whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas , revealing the skel@@ eton of a clearly tram@@ pled woman whose arms and legs stretch towards the corners of the canvas . &quot;
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should actually trust .
&quot; in recent years , the number of &apos; volunteers &apos; has increased in Jordan - the un@@ official outside . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , the number of volunteers in 2016 reached its peak ; however , it is still app@@ alling that Jordan is lacking the institutional infrastructure to support the women who have attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way . &quot;
&quot; according to a law on the crime of crime from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can &quot; &quot; be held in prison for an in@@ definite period of time &quot; , &quot; and for their release it is often necessary to have years of bureaucratic expenditure and the guarantee by the family that the woman has nothing to do . &quot;
&quot; also , H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s music enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from issues that have long been tab@@ oo in his country . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but he ad@@ mits that he cannot separate his music , which is full of explicit references to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot;
&quot; politics was caught in me , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b tac@@ kles the question of Palestinian identity . &quot;
&quot; in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot;
the list of songs that are political in essence can be continued .
&quot; in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song titled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot; &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated stri@@ k@@ ingly often :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is . &quot;
&quot; in the further course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a sort of market on which you can &quot; &quot; get what you want &quot; &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ gen@@ eity or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
he notices that hardly anyone in Jordan speaks about the rights of gay and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on equality of LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals have been cens@@ ored up until 2014 .
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya , in order to note that his comments were torn out of context , distorted and his opinion had been cens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without cuts , but stre@@ amed was only a edited version , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b is campaig@@ ning for the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance to homosexu@@ als is not about Islam . &quot;
&quot; he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ eva , a poet of the eighth century , who still remains in memory thanks to his homo@@ erotic poetry . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ eva , who was supposed to work on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could openly write about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans do that ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot;
&quot; in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ic realm , it is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service stated several former members of the government and members of the Te@@ aching Federation , with the reason that they have critically expressed themselves in social media comments related to the problems rooted in the country . &quot;
&quot; in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to create a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; Jordan has denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - so it sees H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , thou@@ ghtful and internal changes . &quot;
&quot; in the end , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to &quot; experience it . &quot; &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region is approached by music , art and literature of genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs , spreading uni@@ tions and in artificial ways demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least he hopes . &quot;
&quot; until the time comes , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and therefore also offer resistance . &quot;

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these great and extravag@@ ant martial dolls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
&quot; it is assumed that there is a variation of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us in August . another theory states that the v@@ ans , drums and dancing were mar@@ ched over more than a thousand years , to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the em@@ iss@@ hi , to their knees . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we could grab some great seats , so we have a great view . &quot;
it is hard to imagine how large these parts are ...
&quot; a community centre in the capital city , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , hosted a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally . &quot;
I &apos;ve been looking at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two fixed cars are just to be seen .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and still a stunning way to spend his summer : &quot;
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Sommer@@ festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 meter high carriage was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ vi@@ ans trade weapons against sciss@@ ors and raz@@ ors

&quot; outer appearance and body care were rarely as important as in this story , because they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crime and to promote a legitimate profession like that of the hair@@ dresser . &quot;
&quot; El Cal@@ la@@ o , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima , a region with a very high crime rate , where street rob@@ ber@@ y and illegal drug trafficking are everyday . &quot;
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region would not feel safe .
&quot; at the same time , Peru , like many other Central and South American countries , is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men . &quot;
&quot; to copy the trend , appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous athletes such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to getting more and more regular citizens into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these intri@@ cate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the un@@ paralleled demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been held since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; experts compete against each other in order to show who can create the most ec@@ centric looks of them , as can be seen in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on the public fac@@ ebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) . &quot;
&quot; educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found an opportunity to persu@@ ade young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and instead of poor advice to get training in the art of hair@@ dressing which allows them to find work . &quot;
&quot; motivated by this activity and opportunities , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion . &quot;
&quot; before the school year beginning in March , the school offered special training workshops and reported some of their successes : &quot;
&quot; in 1995 , we were the only school in the municipality and the district to which we are very proud , because out of love with the children we built this educational community . &quot;

the following article is the edited version of the contribution &quot; Love messages to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
&quot; is it not even more important , people who feel expelled , to accommodate affection ? &quot;
&quot; this is exactly what prompted the young Colom@@ bian activ@@ ist Leonardo P@@ Ã¡r@@ ra@@ ga from the foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation and inspired her to the campaign Cart@@ as p@@ or la A@@ li@@ aciÃ³n ( letters for reconciliation ) , encouraging young people to write letters to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters . &quot;
&quot; only recently , their country was the scene of a historic event , and they wanted to contribute to it : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government signed a peace agreement with the guer@@ ri@@ lla occupation F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary forces of Colombia ) , which forms the conclusion of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; internationally , the signing of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colom@@ bian president JosÃ© Manuel San@@ tos won the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; however , before the Colom@@ bi@@ ans there is a long way to speak of a real reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters who lived in illegal camps for many years , exposed to war rhet@@ oric and carrying their weapons around the clock , must now integrate themselves into life as civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society , once more used to life in constant fear and in some cases , has gotten used to deep hatred towards guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , must now take it into its ranks and support it in building a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian convinced that the young Colom@@ bi@@ ans should join together and help in the integration process .
&quot; and that &apos;s exactly what they did : up to now , thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters to welcome them back in society . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former guer@@ illa fighter , who will then be delivered personally . &quot;
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for the Let@@ ters to Recon@@ ci@@ liation was born on the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ in February 2017 . there Leonardo and Cr@@ istian had the opportunity to speak with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day , but those who need it much more unnecessary . &quot;
&quot; he plan@@ ed , told him to share his love with people this year , who needed the most pressing response . &quot;
&quot; the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now have to find their place in society and build up a new life . &quot; &quot; the letters will show that Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war story to a common history of peace . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; until now , more than 2,000 letters have been collected during the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities in Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ . &quot;
I never thought that someone would forgive me
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the region of Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca on 19 March .
&quot; a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the municipality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation , travelled to the camp to personally transfer the letters . &quot;
the members of the F@@ ARC set themselves up as they had done earlier to accept the orders of their leaders .
&quot; but this time they did not receive orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; &quot; told Manu@@ ela Jim@@ Ã©@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , an employee of the Gover@@ nor of the Province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience : &quot;
&quot; after passing the letters , a former warri@@ or led me through the camp of guer@@ illa fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ eras &quot; ( a kind of hut where the guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters lived ) I saw a guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter , who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go down , because next to him on the bed there was a M@@ GL pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ate , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty . &quot;
&quot; and I said to him , &quot; &quot; Hello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone wrote to me . &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never in my life somebody has written something so beautiful , so I answer it . &quot; then suddenly my tears ran over the che@@ eks . &quot;
&quot; I hu@@ gged him firmly , and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; perhaps he was sorry for the war , it was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he never expected anything else from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC , was the only way to save him and his six brothers from star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes . &quot;
but now I know there is a society outside that awaits us with open arms .
&quot; so far , I only learned how to deal with weapons . &quot;
&quot; but now where peace reign@@ s , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; at the start of the year , students and some of the F@@ ARC leaders came together for a discussion . &quot;
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC was already active in the secret .
&quot; for this reason , the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organisation , its ideals and gave an insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how social injustice promoted by the state to the entire Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop a political party , we can help shape society in this country more just . &quot;
&quot; the goal of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles , &quot; one of them said . &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; hearing those people who had never heard a hearing and had no right to vote , and recognizing that the people I often saw as a monster and hated even hate , were only people with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their living conditions and their environment , was very painful for me . &quot;
the reality in which the land lives is hur@@ ting me .
&quot; but it comforts me that all people - even those who have killed and caused so much damage , can teach us something and give a smile and a hu@@ g . &quot;
many former fighters responded to the letters .
&quot; Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote the following letter , for example Dar@@ Ã­@@ o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of the town of Cal@@ i : &quot;
the colum@@ bi@@ anist was prophes@@ ied that after dis@@ ar@@ ming would reign peace .
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as there is ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people willing to grab weapons , collect and protest for their rights , and this is also completely justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we of the F@@ ARC now put on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; this is why we call all the def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , for we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will be faced with many difficulties . &quot;
&quot; there will be many obstacles on our way , but together we will overcome them . &quot;
a Trans@@ lator speaks about the persecution in Ch@@ echn@@ ya and the life before Kad@@ y@@ row

it follows the translation of an article written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mak@@ eup and whose first publication took place on the website OC Media .
&quot; gay and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers , including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; with terror , activists have witnessed the reporting of recent months over the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
but the threat that hangs over the LG@@ BT@@ Q community about the LG@@ BT@@ Q community has not been created overnight .
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is happening in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; several months ago , the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has captured the international head@@ lines after reports published that deal with the spread , torture and killing of que@@ er men in the Republic . &quot;
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities who arrested suspi@@ cious que@@ er men and put them into secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; you have brought a monster to the world &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ lator , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
&quot; since her childhood , she felt that she was a woman in reality . &quot;
&quot; when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was no safe place for her , which is why she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after experiencing a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens from the gender balance of their country@@ woman , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina . &quot;
&quot; from fear of her life , she eventually moved to the USA . &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I was working as a volunteer for a human rights organisation .
one day I told me that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a friend of Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman who was in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; as I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it anywhere on the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . &quot;
&quot; after that , the photos of my documents made the round through W@@ hat@@ s@@ App . &quot;
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; when I was watching a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; &quot; Here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
&quot; when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I hurt nothing . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; how long do you want to dish@@ on@@ our the family , you stain ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
&quot; I just know that it was a young man , not 30 years old . &quot;
then I lost consciousness and woke up again in the hospital .
&quot; apparently , some women had all got along and started crying . &quot;
the man had fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
&quot; in the hospital , I learned that I had two stit@@ ches in my right lung . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : in what kind of nur@@ ses were you laid , in which of the men or women ? &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my documents are outdated because my male name stands on it , but the doctor understood and put me to the women . &quot;
I am very grateful to him for this .
&quot; when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am grateful to him for being respect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
last February I received threats .
&quot; they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown . &quot;
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
&quot; they demanded to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya , to prove that it was all a lie . &quot;
&quot; they made absurd demands : some said to me , I must prove it by running through the streets above without going through the streets ; others wanted me to appear in the official television in Gros@@ ny saying that I had not changed my sex , that everything was just bad speech and Photos@@ hop . &quot;
I have grain size C - what would I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still difficult for them .
some elderly people once talked to my mother on the street .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; You have brought a monster to the world that has not only corrupted your family , but the whole republic . &quot;
&quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
&quot; my mother became too much , and she lay a sn@@ are around her neck . &quot;
&quot; luckily , the neighbours came and saved them . &quot;
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with dark@@ ened windows and a number plate with a 95 on the window .
&quot; after it happened for the third time , it became clear to me that there was something rotten . &quot;
my human rights friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for security reasons I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with their help I left the country , but then something incredible happened . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before I left Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived .
&quot; I bought it without registering , without identification , without anything . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the tr@@ ash .
arrived and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t believe , you &apos;d be security just because you left the country ? &quot;
our people know at which hotel you are stuck . you even know your room number .
only to prove it to you : it is the number 115 .
can you imagine this ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; however , we don &apos;t talk about gender equality , that &apos;s a tab@@ oo topic . &quot;
I still carry some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements in me .
&quot; as much as I wish , I can &apos;t overcome this spiritual barrier . &quot;
&quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her . &quot;
&quot; when we chat@@ ted with camera , I really try to look like the person they remember from their past - so to my male form . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends , those who have stayed there ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : last week I submitted a report to Washington .
&quot; for him , I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I spoke to someone who was in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
&quot; he told that during Ram@@ adan there were no people arrested and tortured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait and he did not shut up a new wave . &quot;
most likely they will now focus on family and relatives .
&quot; I mean , they probably invite the relatives who take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; honour &quot; &quot; has experienced satisfaction with blood . &quot;
OC Media : are gay men still held in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : an acquain@@ tance of me says that there are not many .
&quot; if , then , especially those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives in order to put themselves in judgment . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they are held there so that they can be presented as terrorists later . &quot;
&quot; say , &quot; &quot; Sh@@ ould they be killed , they will show their bodies on TV , claiming they have attacked any village or military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not simply gone , but specifically sub@@ merged in order to radic@@ alise themselves . &quot;
OC Media : is that only a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard grew .
there has been nothing new from them since then .
they just took them along .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , that person was there even when these people were taken along . &quot;
&quot; until now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there were no reports so far . however , we suspect that such actions are quite possible . &quot;
why else would you not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already taken place in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
&quot; I think that before 2003 I was already known in quite big , when I was still living there - and I never had any problems . &quot;
in ear@@ nest !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when the sh@@ aria was applied , I never had any problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia originally wanted to bring us to the &quot; &quot; civil@@ isation &quot; , &quot; but finally thrown us back to the Stone Age . &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had colored eyel@@ ashes , wore tub@@ ular jeans and short tops . &quot;
the Ministry of Safety of Sh@@ aria has never injured my hair .
&quot; before the Russian theater in Gros@@ ny , there was a place where every night , especially on weekends , a whole group of people as I met . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several benches were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there . &quot;
we were never offen@@ ded .
&quot; in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Don &apos;t talk about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot;
it is often said to be children when they make fun of the sick .
&quot; OC Media : so they just closed their eyes shut , because they thought you were sick ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : yes .
&quot; they never insul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted and never beaten . &quot;
OC Media : how long did this grace period last ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row stepped on the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to talk about morality on television . &quot;
&quot; he did not talk about us per se , but primarily about the behaviour of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it was possible to feel how people began to change in the city . &quot;
&quot; who had sm@@ iled and laugh@@ ed before , looked at you at once with suspicion . &quot;
&quot; in time , I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel the situation in the Republic steadily deterior@@ ated . &quot;
OC Media : which activity do you go now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I do not earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the USA .
&quot; apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; currently , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women . &quot;
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize te@@ ac@@ re@@ w , meetings , I esc@@ ort them to the hospital and help them get food maps . &quot;
I don &apos;t have a cent for it for a long time .
I discovered these people myself when I cl@@ apped shelter .
I am Muslims and want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s great .
&quot; so nature , that has nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens , who want to prophes@@ y with fr@@ oth in front of the mouth that there are no ga@@ ys with them . &quot;
&quot; the Da@@ ge@@ stan@@ es , who have the Cab@@ ard@@ ines who , the Russians , also have which ; on the whole planet they exist - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I come from there , so it &apos;s unpleasant for me to hear something like that . &quot;
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us here .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
&quot; you know , many think of transi@@ ent to men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different kinds of sensation to be exact , different attitudes of life . &quot;
for me it is the most important thing to feel myself in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
&quot; sorry that I &apos;m going to be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago . &quot;
and I &apos;m not very sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn of an increase in suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ ra@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; since the last few months , there has been a strong increase in suicide . &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ ra@@ z .

&quot; the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August revers@@ ed the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi community in Iran , which is marked by poverty and unemployment , into the spotlight . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in Ah@@ ra@@ z region in the southwest of Iran .
&quot; he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability to pay for his family , so Ah@@ ra@@ zi and human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ ra@@ z and remain anonymous . &quot;
a video shared on YouTube kept the moments after he had kind@@ led himself .
&quot; some people quickly manage to extingu@@ ish the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was taken to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in Ah@@ ra@@ z . &quot;
&quot; according to local sources , the burns were so strong that the doctors could not do anything any more . &quot;
he died shortly afterwards .
&quot; it was not the only suicide assass@@ inated in the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi @-@ minority in August , and activists on the spot warn that more men could take their lives . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Ham@@ id Manifest@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , Sa@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - hang@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers , who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families and pursue a safe work . &quot;
&quot; Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi are suffering from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region , located in which a large part of the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi community living in Iran , was sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis that makes it hard for the local Arab population to deny its livel@@ ihood . &quot;
&quot; a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i monarchy assumed power and made a great effort in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ ra@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population receives little from this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime has refused the Ah@@ ra@@ zi Arabs to systematically create jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries . &quot;
&quot; the government has also built a large number of dam@@ s to diver@@ t the water from the Arab territories into the Persian areas , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are located . &quot;
&quot; these dam@@ s have only led to ag@@ grav@@ ating the devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness , and destroying local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry . &quot;
the unemployment rate among the Arab a@@ haw@@ k youngsters increased to 81 % .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general director of co@@ operatives , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of the Ah@@ ra@@ z@@ is who are looking for a job , completed 55 % of secondary school , and 45 % have a university degree . &quot;
a &quot; systematic strategy &quot; aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian ancest@@ or human rights activ@@ ist with resident in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of suicide among young Ah@@ ra@@ zi . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans and anti @-@ Arab discrimination : &quot;
&quot; since function@@ aries and institutions do not prefer Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi is deprived of access to work opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , which aims to destroy the spirit of the national resistance of young Arabs and to force them to earn their livel@@ ihood outside their native Ah@@ ra@@ z . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their first and last name in order to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ ra@@ zi and to be hired , as even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated , let alone speaking the Arabic language or wearing Arab clothing . &quot;
&quot; given the circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi has to endure , human rights activists commit alarm before the situation becomes explosive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world w@@ akes up and takes notice of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; why I do not identify with femin@@ ism , even with inter@@ sec@@ tional not &quot;
detail of a photo . taken by Pix@@ ab@@ ay . released under the CC@@ 0 Creative Com@@ mons license .
the following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as website . the article was subject to several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
&quot; when I say that I am not a feminist , many women - especially white women - call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - with fru@@ stration . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
&quot; they even lay well thought @-@ out scientific and social arguments in front of me , why I should be a feminist and why we should generally be all feminist * inside . &quot;
&quot; for example , women still earn less money in spite of the same education than men nowadays . &quot;
women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; or that cultural and social norms are still ensuring that women sooner or later stum@@ ble across a glass ceiling in various areas of life , and that discrimination on the basis of gender still attracts across the many different countries and denom@@ inations . &quot;
all of this is aware and well @-@ known to me .
I am convinced and I suffer double and triple among them .
I am a black woman .
&quot; yet , if I come to speak on skin colour , on racism , on black female women , on black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention in what manner we have been ab@@ used physically , mentally and verb@@ ally , both in and out of the feminist movement , many white fem@@ inists decide to remain silent . &quot;
&quot; but they all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; &quot; lift up their voices and &quot; &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord &quot; &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , there is an institution@@ alized form of racial @-@ motivated violence that we are exposed to black women in two ways . &quot;
or that black women and women of other ethnic and home countries earn less than white men and women .
&quot; that black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to the school as white girls , due to obvious integration problems . &quot;
&quot; or that women are exposed to a higher risk in black spheres and women with a migration background , suffer from domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , I want all women to have the same rights for all men and all men . on the other hand , as a black woman , I cannot join a movement in whose center the white woman stands who refuses to consider injusti@@ ces in her mind , which relate both to gender and the skin color of a person . &quot;
&quot; I am exhausted and will not fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ feminist @-@ oriented sphere , which always rejected me and countless other black women . &quot;
&quot; in 18@@ 51 , So@@ jour@@ ner compla@@ ined in her speech : &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is in a historical sense a de@@ human@@ ized and margin@@ alized being . &quot;
&quot; I refuse to join groups who also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropri@@ ation , in order to advance their ego@@ centric programme . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer attempt to close white women to the importance of over@@ lap of skin colour and gender . for some of them continue to keep silent on the significance of black women for the feminist movement , no matter how many black women try to teach them for a better . &quot;
&quot; although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different revenues a home and to distinguish themselves from white femin@@ ism , there is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in its name . &quot;
&quot; I prefer to release myself fully and completely from femin@@ ism and to join the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which has been called into life for my dark skin and my status as a woman , rather than for a white @-@ feminist paradigm that is so stub@@ born that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon . &quot;
now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and enter into the spheres that are created by us for us .
&quot; Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ cana wom@@ anism : Rec@@ la@@ iming ( for example : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ isms : how we can defend ourselves ) speaks of how we can defend ourselves to our own way . and not only that - black women can thus also create spaces in which they can be worshipped in the cultural , mental , spiritual , physical and even the spiritual elements that make up the black woman . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists will immediately call separ@@ atism and margin@@ alisation after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself of the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the feminist movement of which the black woman is affected . &quot;
&quot; in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can lift black women and women from other cultures , as in this paradigm I exist . &quot;
&quot; because of my dark skin and because of my existence , I am recognized as a woman as a part of this paradigm . &quot;
&quot; I , a black woman , can blo@@ om in an environment in which my life is neither b@@ yp@@ assed nor ignored nor rejected . &quot;
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
&quot; this contribution by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports in particular about international efforts to solve environmental problems . &quot;
&quot; as part of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published once again . &quot;
&quot; in the past 7 years , Nab@@ il Mus@@ a traveled again and again with a special concern of the Kurdist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission is to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations . &quot;
in this documentary by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church .
&quot; I really wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child , &quot; Mus@@ a tells . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the NGO Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq and to support local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summ@@ arises the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in one question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
&quot; this video was produced , filmed and published for En@@ sia von E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist resident in Er@@ bil , Iraq . &quot;
&quot; the focus of their work is on persecuted , little not@@ e@@ worthy sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative photography and new multimedia techniques , with the help of supp@@ ressed communities to tell their stories in their own way . &quot;
Paragu@@ ays Women and their difficult fight against violence

&quot; the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and edited version of the article &quot; &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; &quot; by Kur@@ tural . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ mu@@ j@@ er ( # ern@@ lich@@ ein@@ eph@@ p ) , which reports on the violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
most names have been modified to protect the affected individuals .
&quot; a police comm@@ iss@@ ary said A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez , that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner , who had become violent against her . &quot;
&quot; since the end of their relationship some time has passed and the police said their statement would be put to the acts , but more could not be done . &quot;
&quot; when another woman showed Bal@@ bu@@ ena due to ill treatment , the A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez display also used nothing . &quot;
a few days later the second woman with@@ drew her ad .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women complain at all , they generally do not receive support from the State . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also financially dependent on men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women admit to be victims of violence , to report to the prosecution authorities at all . &quot;
&quot; content 1 Stri@@ ps and Statisti@@ cal 2 In@@ visible abuse and a legal system that does not prohi@@ bit Paraguay @-@ 3 Paragu@@ ays Law : good approach , poor implementation of pun@@ ches and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to determine how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aciÃ³n y E@@ studios , a socio @-@ scientific research institute in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; there are various information and reports that do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay &quot; , &quot; she explains . &quot;
&quot; however , the figures available are alar@@ ming . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the District At@@ tor@@ ney Office launched 9@@ 600 adver@@ ts for domestic violence . at 70 % of it , it was about violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
&quot; there were more than 5,000 advertisements for domestic violence in the courts of peace . 86 % of the ads of women came here as well . &quot;
&quot; in the ads , 40 % of women said they were physically mi@@ stre@@ ated , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse . &quot;
&quot; however , these statistics do not show the real extent of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; &quot; on every woman who is ref@@ unded in Paraguay for psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do this . &quot;
&quot; on any woman who is ref@@ unded because of physical abuse , two women who do not do this , &quot; &quot; she declared at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; because women &apos;s murder is not a criminal off@@ ence in Paraguay , the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered by their current or former partners each year . &quot;
&quot; by August 2016 alone , journalists included at least 12 cases of women &apos;s suicide in the country . &quot;
the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases in which women were murdered by their current or former partners .
&quot; according to estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies because of violence by men . &quot;

invisible abuse and a legal system that under@@ mines nothing
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z became the strong friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the names of all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do that , but after that , she had to repent . &quot;
&quot; today , Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos together . but for two years she endu@@ red mental violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult to recognize : &quot;
I never thought I would become a victim of abuse .
&quot; when I read about it earlier , I always thought that it only happened to women who are too sub@@ servi@@ ent because they let themselves be deceived by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the abuse by Carlos Vera .
&quot; without nam@@ ing a name , she wrote contributions on Facebook where she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he isolated her . &quot;
&quot; many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos itself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically if he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse . &quot;
&quot; other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had fallen so long by Carlos , and did not leave him earlier . &quot;
it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse should at least have a certain complic@@ ity in it .
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , who is not from Paraguay , fought for nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner was mi@@ stre@@ ated her . &quot;
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te Cre@@ o network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) consisting of women who are all victims of abuse in any way .
&quot; in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Victoria &apos;s case everything started with psych@@ ic abuse .
her wealthy partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
&quot; Victoria &apos;s advertising at the authorities stayed without results and even from their relatives , she received no support . &quot;
&quot; she led a trial against her former partner who developed into an im@@ penet@@ r@@ able legal battle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner . &quot;
&quot; Paraguay Law : good approach , poor implementation &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but not being applied . &quot;
&quot; the display of abuse is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in the application of the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed at the Paragu@@ ay@@ an parliament , known as # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # prince ) under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as . &quot;
this h@@ ash@@ tag and motion # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non @-@ Uni@@ fication ) are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original draft of the law stipul@@ ates that fem@@ ici@@ d has to declare to an independent criminal record and to punish the har@@ dener as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; in this way , the text has been changed in a number of ways in order to also win the de@@ pu@@ ties of the law , which feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions , which is currently banned in Paraguay , will be punished with up to five years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the original bill fores@@ aw the majority of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs , which the victims of violence must bear witness to themselves , if they simply want to refund and receive a secure accommodation to impose the state . &quot;
Ech@@ au@@ ri argue that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it :
&quot; in Paraguay , mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships . &quot;
&quot; in this case , a re@@ thinking must take place so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal . &quot;
&quot; whoever is silent in the face of these facts , complic@@ ates and contributes to the fact that the perpetr@@ ators come away . &quot;
we have to report as long as abuse is no longer considered normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . however , parts of the law had been modified , including a passage that the partners called in cases of domestic violence for reconciliation . &quot;
the opinions on the changes go apart .
the section on reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
&quot; the presentation of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law , however , is considered a great set@@ back . &quot;

independent media in Oman exposed to attacks one year after the ban of a newspaper
&quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked because of a resolution of the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; on the homepage of the forbidden newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; more than a year ago , the Cuban authorities closed the independent Arabic newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of its reporting on corruption in the sul@@ t@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison where he will have a one @-@ year prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and tried , but later released . &quot;
&quot; Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after he had deposited his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; Ã©@@ tat . &quot;
&quot; since then , in addition to his role as the sole Sultan , he has been suffering the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Finance Minister , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the Sultan of Sul@@ t@@ ans is characterised by the continued efforts by the security forces , in particular the domestic secret services , the freedom of the public , including freedom of the press , restric@@ ting and detention of human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ g@@ gers and other activists . &quot;
&quot; the authorities restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights systematically and prevent citizens , including activists , to express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions , both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , its closure and detention for three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country . &quot;
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper that has been reported since its foundation in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
&quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , noted that an article entitled &quot; High @-@ rank parties tie up the hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary &quot; on 26 July 2016 . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials were accused of having put pressure on judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to raise a verdict in a succession dispute . &quot;
&quot; the edition of the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper from July 26 , 2016 with a report on the title page with the title : &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties tie the hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a member of the editorial board , was invited by the ISS before the special department and arrested on his arrival by the security forces . &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2016 , ISS took hold of the deputy editor @-@ in @-@ chief of You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is arrest . &quot;
&quot; the paper was closed at an in@@ definite time after the Minister of Information had given the statement that &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper on any road , including online , was banned from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i took place before the Court in Mas@@ kat . &quot;
the court sentenced the three journalists to prison and also ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned , among other things , for disorder of public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet , &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the state . &quot; &quot;
&quot; moreover , Al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of public prohibition and slan@@ der . &quot;
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es of 3,000 om@@ ani@@ ans ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . &quot;
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after having found the use of an information network to spread material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
&quot; for Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a security deposit of 5000 cubic Ri@@ al ( 13@@ 000 US dollars ) was fixed and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; al @-@ Abr@@ i acqu@@ itted the Appe@@ als Court in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to six months in prison for a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari . &quot;
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 , after serving his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison , where he fin@@ es his imprisonment sentence . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Appe@@ als Court ann@@ ul@@ led the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in spite of the decision of the court to allow Az@@ am@@ n to return , the newspaper is still exposed to attacks by the government . &quot;
&quot; on 8 January the Minister of Information issued an order , with which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended for three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and with which the minister once again opposed the decision of the Court of Appe@@ al to re@@ vo@@ ke the publication of the newspaper . &quot;
the continuing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which Oman has recently been viol@@ ated the freedom of the press .
&quot; further injuries include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and exercising pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease its operation . &quot;
&quot; due to the continuing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ bian authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the Cuban authorities to : &quot;
1 . to release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
2. create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n so that their journalists can pursue their work ;
3 . protecting the freedom of the press in the country and
&quot; 4 . in all circumstances , to ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman have hin@@ dered their legitimate human rights work un@@ hin@@ dered and without fear of re@@ pris@@ als , including judicial arbit@@ ration . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( including independent journalists , blo@@ g@@ gers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring countries by the promotion of freedom of expression and association and the right to assemble peac@@ efully , and to offer them protection . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , illustration takes place with his consent &quot;
medical research in Africa is rarely or even not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
&quot; there are two reasons for the need for medical research performed on site : on the one hand , many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the special medical need on the African continent are missing . &quot;
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have far more serious effects in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investments in the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a big problem . &quot;
&quot; secondly , research that is carried out by African scientists is helping to build their own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is the Director of the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia in the 1990s , when the AIDS epide@@ mic first showed serious effects on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for a study in the United States , first in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself researched the HIV virus before he decided to go back home in order to support the S@@ Ã¡@@ bian health system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about the mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research . &quot;
( discla@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GM ) : what is your research topic ?
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier &apos;s RW : at the moment , the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the Serbian National Programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; in addition , I am just starting a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens . &quot;
GM : what do you think are the key current scientific topics in your country and general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; this has to change , otherwise we will always remain recipients instead of being a do@@ er . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get are often not very useful in our environment , and sometimes it is impossible to use them here . &quot;
GM : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported in a variety of ways .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or want to move here , because financing and development chances are better in other countries . &quot;
GV : what is the research infrastructure ?
what are the obstacles in your routine research work you didn &apos;t have before ?
&quot; RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory equipment is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
GM : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
&quot; RW : there is already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods . &quot;
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; GM : how large is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on , and how can we support development ? &quot;
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there is need for special academic training , beginning at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer sciences , big data , study of space , health care ( non @-@ communic@@ able and con@@ ta@@ gious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly . &quot;
speed GV : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa vs. Western countries based on your experience ?
&quot; RW : often it is the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that presents challenges here . &quot;
&quot; the system that magazines only make articles available against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; ) , also limits the amount of information available and the speed of research . &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change global food production
&quot; this contribution by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website of En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine about solutions for environmental problems worldwide . &quot;
Frank Mort@@ on has been breeding in the USA since the 1980s .
&quot; its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ skir@@ che , the first plant that has been grown and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space . &quot;
&quot; for almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work was limited only by his own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many sorts of salad he can get . &quot;
but at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them for breeding .
&quot; the patents were used not only for single varieties , but also for certain properties , such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green or cri@@ mp@@ ed leaves . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as grain or cart@@ on types . because of this trend , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia of old tradition , Mort@@ on is still breeding with salad , but he needs longer , since his work is increasingly complicated by more and more restrictions . &quot;
it is as if a b@@ oul@@ der is lying in a river for which I have to p@@ addle .
&quot; so we have to do it now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think that these patents go too far on salads . &quot;
&quot; and if they stand before judgment , nobody can breed a new type of let@@ tu@@ ce because all features are already patented . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , he is very careful and endeav@@ ours to not use any material protected as intellectual property . &quot;
he has also joined a movement that gets bigger in the USA and anywhere in the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( Open Source Bre@@ eding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have raised and eaten red Roman salad of the Out@@ sh@@ rou@@ d variety in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station . there it is tested if plants can be grown in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds more like the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding .
&quot; the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for open @-@ source seed ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copy@@ righ@@ ted software . &quot;
&quot; it was established in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property , and are thus permanently usable for plant breeders . &quot;
&quot; as part of the initiative , called Os@@ si , US breeders can commit themselves to the fact that others can freely use the seed bred by them . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open Source &quot; breeders simply allow others who buy their seeds to breed their own varieties , and do not immediately sow - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant pat@@ ents . &quot;
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy outlook
&quot; for the professor at the University of Wis@@ con@@ sin Ma@@ dison and Os@@ si board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control of seeds and the possibility of breeding new plants is important for food security and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; according to him , seeds play a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance . &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement does not concern genetically modified plants .
&quot; all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grains , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over the seed , &quot; he says , and takes on the increasingly common mer@@ gers in the global agriculture industry , as it is , for example , on farmers markets . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to continuing to make their seeds available free of charge , as opposed to patent seed and plant traits . &quot;

&quot; Os@@ si supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk , as the available genetic pool is continuously shr@@ inking due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore always available . &quot;
&quot; Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of Os@@ si , has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . &quot;
&quot; such estimates do not yet exist for other plants , but experts such as Lu@@ by suspect that mas@@ ked plants such as wheat are patented in an even larger style than let@@ tu@@ ce or car@@ rots . &quot;
a question of view
plants are bred in such a way that they have specifically desirable traits - from those through which their taste or colour improves down to those due to which they prosp@@ er in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
&quot; opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing by more and more patents . genetic diversity is more need@@ ful than ever , since the changing conditions caused by climate change are much worse predic@@ tive . &quot;
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ subscri@@ ber C@@ arly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to acknow@@ le@@ dges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . &quot;
&quot; it contradic@@ ts the view that intellectual property hing@@ es other breeders , as &quot; patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has expi@@ red . &quot;
often these instructions help others to get the same result with another method .
&quot; thus , such protection does not hin@@ der innovations , but encourages them by providing more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot;
&quot; Mort@@ on looks different : 20 years to wait , until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly no innovations promote innovation . &quot;
&quot; and if you have to wait for such a long time to breed with plants adapted to the changing environmental conditions , you would have lost the battle . &quot;
&quot; however , the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant breeders do not have the time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us . &quot;
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; this is what drives us , and it is impossible for us to continue using the best and most recent genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; in total , Mort@@ on interfer@@ es with the concept of patented plant traits : &quot; we don &apos;t really create the features ourselves . &quot;
&quot; the plants form them themselves and as breeders , we ultimately have no idea how the plants do that . &quot;
a mystery of nature . &quot;
&quot; there is another important aspect of plant breeding for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant bree@@ der in the US state of O@@ reg@@ on and Os@@ si . &quot;
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures are needed for their cultivation of mass her@@ bi@@ cides that grow into its varieties of this concept of agriculture .
my concept is exactly opposite . &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than Z. B. Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , they manage most smaller seed companies , even without patents - either they reject the pat@@ enting or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case . &quot;
the independent plant bree@@ der Frank Mort@@ on looks for salads in his breeding garden .

&quot; furthermore , Mort@@ on believes that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant pat@@ rons : &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patented . &quot;
&quot; I need constantly new material for my catalog , because I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; with a patent you are protected against competition for 20 years . &quot;
&quot; although the US seems to be a leader in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept is spreading rapidly throughout the world . &quot;
&quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources , is a &quot; open source &quot; seed program . &quot;
it also supports them to get to Open Source seeds and sell their own .
&quot; the German organization Agre@@ col is working on an &quot; open source &quot; license , which is ultimately a more formal and legally binding form of the Os@@ si obligation for breeders in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ( rules for breeding differ from country to country , hence the Os@@ si obligation can &apos;t be easily adopted one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be patented . &quot;
&quot; however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards the pat@@ enting of seeds . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for Open Source seed systems , explains that the organization currently builds a worldwide alliance for &quot; open source seed systems , &quot; which should be the official start @-@ off next year . &quot;
&quot; an association of environmental protection and development groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on erosion , technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database of seeds and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , has published a report . &quot;
&quot; the report also highlights the importance of a diverse local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a context , which Lu@@ by von Os@@ si hopes to see him soon . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has mainly taken care of where and how something is grown and seed systems have hardly played a role here , &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that even more is behind their food . &quot;

human rights organization and blog are the latest goals of cens@@ orship in Egypt
&quot; still , the Egyptian authorities blocked content on the Internet . &quot;
this time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
&quot; on the weekend of the 5th of August , the Egyptian government closed the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported on it . &quot;
&quot; in August , the network published an opinion on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities have sharply critic@@ ised and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains stead@@ fast despite this attack and the ridi@@ cu@@ le of Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who should defend the law and to give a voice to victims . even though it has never been so difficult to keep track of these goals , it has never been as important as now . &quot;
&quot; the AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , the Arab @-@ language issue of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Al Jaz@@ e@@ era network originating from Qatar for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot; &quot;

&quot; in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada is no longer able to access Egypt . &quot;
Zi@@ ada took advantage of his blog for the spread of columns and articles that he writes for in Egypt non @-@ accessible websites and media .
&quot; now the blog he directed to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government , even the aim of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blo@@ gger , the provider in which also Zi@@ bi@@ blog is located , on the other hand is more accessible . &quot;
&quot; a former photo@@ journalist , Zi@@ ada spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video on how police practiced physical violence against two students . &quot;
his articles revol@@ ve mainly around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada commented on the block@@ ade by the government and reflected what this meant for him : &quot;
&quot; to lock blogs is very old , however , in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ eful al @-@ S@@ isi priority ; and even though the blocking of the blog may not be significant for the world , so it is for two reasons for me : &quot;
&quot; they succeeded in giving me the feeling of a siege . an arrest , a tried @-@ and @-@ tested murder , sum@@ mons to the National Security Council , the block@@ ade blogs and any other website for which I worked . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) They have proven that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have influence , although only to a small audience . &quot;
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
&quot; first , I used it to post articles to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship . &quot;
&quot; however , after having locked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the brave go the way to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) , Egyptian authorities closed their websites from May 24th to June 0@@ 6th . this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and E@@ ti@@ sal@@ at . &quot;
&quot; also documented the blocking of providers , through the reloc@@ ation of internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s ) &quot;
she reported in her research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of websites offered by V@@ P@@ N@@ s began . &quot;
such a practice indicates the government &apos;s intention to further block and filter content that could have access to Egyptian users .
&quot; the situation is worsen@@ ed in addition to the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are made behind closed doors , so that the Egyptian population has no legal basis , by means of which it can proceed in court against these actions . &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with cens@@ orship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants dispute .
&quot; the Brazilian Army was deployed in the fav@@ el@@ as in Nit@@ er@@ Ã³@@ i , a city in the State of Rio de Janeiro , during the government crisis . &quot;

&quot; day after day , newspapers in all Brazil speak with dark head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motifs . &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old in school , &quot; &quot; Every second day , a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is murdered , &quot; &quot; Thi@@ eves rob@@ bing dru@@ g@@ store with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , nav@@ y and air af@@ ee to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the force wave 2017 in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years . &quot;
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization Global Justice even called upon the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; find at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; the newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; published for the detailed coverage of violence in Rio on August 16 , published the editorial &quot; This is not normal , &quot; in which she announced a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the paper explained the motives for their decision :
&quot; extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sex crimes , etc . everything , however , devi@@ ates from the civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio , is published in the category &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way of calling : this is not normal ! &quot;
this is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ e@@ des , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , declared that this decision was not a reason for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
it is probably the only newspaper on the whole world with a war bri@@ k in a country that does not recognize war at all .
&quot; in the same video , a journalist of the paper explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro , there are 8@@ 43 areas that are controlled by criminal organisations . &quot;
&quot; in the editorial , the newspaper writes : &quot;
&quot; we are aware that a war dis@@ courses , when it is distorted , can also be used to obsc@@ ure the atro@@ cities of the police that first shoot and then ask questions . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Ma@@ fia and its partners . &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; hurt more than it benefits ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , journalist Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , on the other hand , ar@@ gues to design@@ ate the violence as a &quot; war . &quot; &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , education and a historic and compl@@ ac@@ ent neglect of public service . &quot;
&quot; as a reminder , Rio de Janeiro &apos;s federal state is larger than its capital . &quot;

&quot; according to Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia , Rio de Janeiro is considered &quot; the most violent place in Brazil , &quot; says Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are in the north and north @-@ east of the country according to statistics from 2015 . &quot;
none of these cities is located in the State of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; if we look at the mur@@ ders per state , Rio is ranked 16 , &quot; she writes . &quot;
&quot; extra belongs to Glob@@ o , the largest media corporation of South America , which , like Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia , has been empha@@ sizing the security policy of the state for years . &quot;
&quot; these security policy measures also included the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003 , whose objective is to capture a fav@@ ela by deplo@@ ying a massive police unit and permanently station@@ ing one unit there . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , however , this actually led to a decrease of violent deaths . for several years , however , U@@ PP has been getting increasingly under attack after several reports of har@@ ass@@ ment and repression against the poor communities , which should protect the newly created police unit . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ Ã£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux cited one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria established by the Geneva Convention on the term &quot; civil war . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as war also draws serious consequences for people . &quot;
&quot; this requires the state to use means and means that are typical of a war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; where a civilian is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost bul@@ lets . &quot; &quot;
&quot; war back or forth , the fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as in Rio continue to suffer . &quot;
&quot; a week later , the police declared the mountain with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a fruit sal@@ es@@ man died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter . &quot;

to stay alive : besi@@ eg@@ ed Syrians learn to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the advertising video .
source : Can@@ not Action
&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime against loy@@ alist troops . &quot;
&quot; according to Siege Watch , a joint initiative of the Peace organization PA@@ X and the research institute , The Syria Institute , there are currently around one million Syrians in Damascus and the surrounding area , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ li@@ b . &quot;
&quot; the East Gh@@ out@@ a region is particularly affected , where chemical weapons attack on 21 August 2013 demanded hundreds of civilians . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition are based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organizations that the Assad regime has been perpet@@ rated by Assad &apos;s regime . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these controlled areas have been besi@@ eg@@ ed by rebels outside Damascus , which led to the need for inhabitants being locally made or dependent on food smu@@ g@@ gled by tunnels and control points . &quot;
&quot; through years of block@@ ade , traditional food such as meat has become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and academ@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , how they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; &quot; food saving food source &quot; . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project jointly with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; fung@@ i do not belong to the traditional foods planted in Syria , and are rarely part of the Syrian kitchen . however , their food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besi@@ eg@@ ed east Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the Direc@@ tly of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we decided to cultivate fung@@ i because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because it is possible to plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
&quot; Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports to Global Vo@@ ices that for three years he has been fighting to make this project known and expressed his relief that it is now gaining more and more promin@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; in order to earn money for the initiative , we use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to give 125 families knowledge of the plant@@ ation of mushrooms , according to Dr. Lei@@ la on Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of some 12,@@ 700 â¬ , but will continue to raise funds on Can@@ Do until Monday , 04 September 2017 . &quot;
the initiative is dependent on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80 % .
&quot; because of the fuel shortage , locally produced plastic fuels are used in plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they started &quot; &quot; Production of Mus@@ h@@ rooms from the Regi@@ ons &quot; &quot; before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
&quot; then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on . &quot;
now they have designed a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed fung@@ i everywhere in East Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge . &quot;
Dr. Lei@@ la stated that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach the people mushroom @-@ breeding for various reasons &quot; &quot; : break of the siege . &quot;
provision of a new food source on the market .
&quot; spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food lef@@ to@@ vers ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , etc . ) to extract new foods . &quot;
&quot; creation of new jobs , especially for women working at home . &quot;
creating new jobs for people with disabilities who are tied to their home .
he said : &quot; we hope to spread this idea around the world so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and siege becomes visible .
we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity .

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of 2017
&quot; several hundred people prot@@ ested on October 21 in many districts of Portugal and called for justice for the victims of the fires , which raised in the week before in the north of Portugal . &quot;
forty @-@ two persons died and about 70 injured in due to the fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the government &apos;s last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
&quot; bran@@ dies were also registered in the Gali@@ cia region of Spain , where there were 4 deaths . &quot;
&quot; it is estimated that there were more than 500 out@@ breaks spread in the northern and central regions of the country , reaching about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages . &quot;
&quot; in June , a similar tragedy occurred in Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured . &quot;
&quot; according to the European forest surveillance system that monitors forest land by satellite ima@@ gery , approximately 500@@ ,000 hectares of wood are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district . &quot;
so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is only a fire in 4 districts .
&quot; all Portugal is burning in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15 , 2017 &quot;
some of Twitter users shared images :
that &apos;s Bra@@ ga this night . # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal # Bra@@ ga # F@@ og@@ os@@ PT
numerous videos spread on the net and show images that allow better insights into what is happening :
the fores@@ eeable tragedy
the aim of the Saturday protests was the demand for better preventive and fire @-@ fighting measures by the state .
people wondered why civil protection was not able to reduce the scale of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ Ã£o Sover@@ al of the federal government of Portugal declared P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o &apos;s paper :
&quot; after Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o , streets and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing . &quot;
&quot; this Sunday they did not do this anywhere : there are dozens of open streets , surrounded by fire . &quot;
&quot; in the woods of Lei@@ ria there could have been a similar tragedy like in June , as the roads were closed very late . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , building permits in locations with high fire risk are questioned . &quot;
a wide @-@ reaching proposal for forest reform introduced by the government after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 was obj@@ ected by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments .
&quot; the government introduced a sl@@ ack@@ ening of the law which allowed the construction activity of case to fall , if the applicant had funds for self @-@ protection - that was an open backdoor , so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; Jo@@ Ã£o Sor@@ val continues in the same article of the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organisation Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of slightly burning wood , as in a vi@@ cious circle , continue to spread after fires of this kind . &quot;
&quot; these problems add to the fact that the website of Portugal &apos;s civil defence on 15 and 16 October , when residents looked for information or trying to contact relatives , was offline . &quot;
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : it explo@@ ded their own civil protection data using the f@@ og@@ os.@@ app and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of fires .
&quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ Ã£o P@@ ina to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ g@@ ade and , on this fat@@ eful weekend in October , was so crucial that the servers didn &apos;t stand up to the ons@@ lau@@ ght of the 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the website counted more than half a million hits . &quot;
even the founder asked for help :

the road from refugee from Afghanistan to a successful entrepreneur

&quot; in one night in the autumn of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban . &quot;
&quot; two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups that had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus , Afghanistan had become a country of terror and despair . &quot;
&quot; at that time A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , sat in the province G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner . &quot;
&quot; even if his mother did not say so at that time , she knew she would not see her son for a long time - maybe even more . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , the boy was supposed to break up . &quot;
his un@@ cle would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

&quot; Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat , the leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat party , had just been assass@@ inated by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt un@@ protected . &quot;
&quot; the Taliban , known for their hatred of the Haz@@ ara , came closer and closer . &quot;
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
some days after his escape A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan again .
&quot; for a few years , he worked in a coal pit . the work was heavy and made him sick . &quot;
&quot; then he took what was left of his small salary , and went to Iran . once again , he was in a foreign country with other refugees and dra@@ gged sacks with mort@@ ars that were heavier than himself , to earn his livel@@ ihood . &quot;
&quot; back then , as today , Afghan refugees in Iran have been characterised by misery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ af remembered in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the building site where we worked . &quot;
there were no services there and no heating . we hung n@@ ylon in front of the open windows so that we do not freeze at night .
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ af has left his life without papers in Iran and made himself ready for the journey to Europe . &quot;
&quot; during the dangerous crossing on the sea , he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities rejected asylum , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 . &quot;
&quot; some time A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , ran through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to aid patients twice a day . &quot;
&quot; it is true that due to relatively high rates of reference , Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers . however , it is also true that the conditions of asylum seekers in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot;
&quot; the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency . &quot;
&quot; the large majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; special reception centres &quot; . &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
&quot; according to the Italian law , asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they officially have submitted an application for asylum - which can go for months after the registration of the asylum application . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who have no money for accommodation can either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street . &quot;
so it was also A@@ shar@@ af .
&quot; but his un@@ bo@@ unded life @-@ spirit helped A@@ shar@@ af , soon to free himself from these conditions . &quot;
&quot; after several years of work in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af put his entire savings into the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice . &quot;
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a quick snack .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now the theme of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
&quot; the film received the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; a lot of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to official estimates , some 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , some of Afgh@@ ans have emerged , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , in which the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy by the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts . &quot;
&quot; in Pad@@ ua , the Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna and a sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af@@ s targets , however , reach far beyond the Italian gastronomy industry and retailers and aim back to the country which he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where a risk is , there are also opportunities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I can &apos;t live happily if I know my people are suffering .
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af also for@@ ges plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul where people can learn packaging and cutting techniques . &quot; &quot; they can sell their crop sur@@ pl@@ uses on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end stability and prosperity stand . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af has made this trip himself , and now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path . &quot;
&quot; citizen Report : bill from Egypt to cut social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , has been in custody for more than 900 days . &quot;
he reported on the evacu@@ ation of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ v@@ ya in Cairo which prot@@ ested against the de@@ composition of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

&quot; global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ tizen &apos;s Report is an international snapshot , which shows challenges , victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights &quot;
the Egyptian parliament has reviewed a draft bill that fores@@ ees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook just after registering with a government agency .
users would need to be able to use social networks within six months of submitting their full name as well as their ID number .
those who miss this step could be sentenced to six months in prison or to the end of a criminal off@@ ence .
&quot; the Act , which was applied by sixty members of Parliament , is currently in front of the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and shall be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; in May , another MP filed a legislative proposal that would introduce har@@ sh@@ er sentences for the insul@@ t of the President or a senior official . &quot;
&quot; under the law of law , however , such action would be punished with prison and fin@@ es , as legal experts at Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; if the law is passed , this may mean up to three years imprisonment for the convic@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in je@@ op@@ ar@@ dy for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he took photos of violence against prot@@ esters who demonstrated against the military coup , which led to the inc@@ it@@ ement of the elected president Mohammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; as more than 700 prot@@ esters detained in the same incident , Sha@@ w@@ kan waited for four years in prison for a trial date . &quot;
&quot; recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to the 20th May because the prison leadership , according to the human rights groups , failed to bring the accused from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan men@@ tions the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , false burdens of including weapons possession , illegal gathering , murder and attempted murder . &quot;
&quot; in another case , a criminal tribunal in G@@ iza called the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their coverage of pro @-@ Mor@@ si sitting block@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya Square in Cairo . &quot;
&quot; the Court also reduced the punishment of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mu@@ staf@@ a and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the aforementioned incident from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
Tunisi@@ an activists inter@@ ce@@ de with in@@ feed documents
&quot; in May , Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ rog@@ ation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy Project . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia was chi@@ ef@@ ly inter@@ ro@@ gated by the President of the Republic , who , according to the plan , expressly supports a controversial bill that would guarantee business@@ men and during the former regime dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption accused of corruption . &quot;
&quot; the document published on April 21 , published on the Na@@ wa@@ at website , sheds light on how the presidential plans to support the bill of legislation will look like . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the nom@@ ination of his sources stating Article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an press code , which ass@@ ures journalists the right to protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , at the District Court in Tunis on May 9th , he was a witness in the event . &quot;
does China want to force users of social media to present their identity ?
&quot; according to new regulations of the Office of Information Bureau of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China require permission before they write or share messages in social media . &quot;
the regulations also indicate that the registration with the full real name will be required .
analysts assume that by this way the elimination of anonymous comments should be achieved within social networks . it is still unclear how the authorities will apply these rules .
Chinese citizens have proposed in social media to enforce these rules only sel@@ ectively in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence .
do we then see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
&quot; in May , the state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat . &quot;
&quot; according to Ros@@ com@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register in the Land government as &quot; Organ@@ izer of the Distribution of Information . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this term is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government provides a list of online services that organize the &quot; publication of the information . &quot; &quot;
&quot; these websites are currently websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ classi@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , e @-@ mail service Mail@@ .@@ ru , and dozens of other services . &quot;
Turkish dish has ban Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
&quot; a Turkish dish had the per@@ dition of Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia Administr@@ ators refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the data , Turkey support the jihadi@@ sts in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication gave the site to &quot; &quot; a source of information that co@@ operates with groups in order to inc@@ ite a political de@@ fam@@ ation campaign against Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time that Turkey has completely blocked the website . it is , among other things , China , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
Britain cannot stop to sni@@ ff around
&quot; after this week , the British government is in the midst of a deliber@@ ate consultation on increased surveillance powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install Backdoor programs that de@@ code data encryption . &quot;
&quot; the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence services regarding the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the consultation continues until May 19 . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior . &quot;
