<seg id="1">"although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012, I would now live there for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is exceptionally great.</seg>
<seg id="4">"like many of my generation, I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American authors and ran their sport."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had a profound effect on me that I was a journalist mainly because of an American film."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Letter, a fearless reporter who, with the help of Julia Roberts, revealed the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate, who wanted to occupy the supreme federal court with judges who were interested in his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free to Method Man," I was it as if it was the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the USA was only strengthened."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said," America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very blackish love letter concerning his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in his opinion, he never stops the mountain, as one says so beautifully."</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague puts it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afroamericans and women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, the people responded to his statements and voted in droves for him."</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in the Republican elections was the highest number one ever won by the Party.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">"who are the Americans who support this bigoted person, I asked myself?"</seg>
<seg id="21">I couldn't reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">"for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program that people from all over the world receive, a deeply believing person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Trumps's view of the world did not coincide with that of Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Trumps intolerance also contrasts with the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fought the environment for her life, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son."</seg>
<seg id="26">She is still adapting to the commitment of Kristi Kappes who always helped me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew leakey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, their wiser advice helped me a lot in my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love of America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump suspected his way to the nominate republican presidential candidate, she offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on November 8, 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly White, gave the presidency to a man despite - or perhaps because of his contempt for non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the debate with the idea that people voted for Trump because they shared their racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to designate the Trump voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"to classify people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful and indicates an inability to understand those who act in a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their congregations are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters, most of whom are white, voted for Trump because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they might say they are still important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick who commentates on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down upon those who look different from him."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" whitelash "(note d. d.: white against all other ethnic groups," stemming white against the whites and whiplash, which means so much like slingshot trauma), as the big Van Jones called, has exactly what America has done so magnificently. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter if myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which belief or background one may have, America welcomes everyone."</seg>
<seg id="43">"this land chose as its president twice the son of a Kenyaners, whose history as he says himself, nowhere else in the world would be possible."</seg>
<seg id="44">"but with the election of Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the White America that promises and says: to Hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11, the white man is again at the helm, say they."</seg>
<seg id="46">"with all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">"on a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan. "</seg>
<seg id="49">"the crowd answered with a loud" "no!" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" roared the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they cried, and their voices were louder. "</seg>
<seg id="56">"if someone, who is not like you, would have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and loud "NO"!</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan concluded with the words:" thank God, Mr. Trump, this is not your America. "36 hours later he was corrected."</seg>
<seg id="59">The country for which his son had fallen sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">"this is now Trumps Land, said the message."</seg>
<seg id="61">"and all the people who look like Mr. Khan, couldn't find a place in this new America anymore."</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What does the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero commune in the province of Oaxaca have in common with the children of the Paraguayan city of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">"the music played in both places not only changed the life of the children, but also a very close connection with..."</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">"Vicente Guerrero is located on the outskirts of a large garbage dump, only 16 kilometres south of Oaxaca and # 8212; an old colonial town, which is very popular among tourists -but worlds away from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine."</seg>
<seg id="73">"for several years now, La banda de MÃºsica (Music bande) has been playing in the congregation: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty with their musical instruments."</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the church of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">"the community, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its abuse of drugs and gangs of gangs."</seg>
<seg id="77">"but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot, who launched a musical project and offered the youth such a rare hopelessness."</seg>
<seg id="78">"the young band members take their obligations towards the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:"</seg>
<seg id="79">"as soon as they come out of school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"they always come laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the hustle and they learn the day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, Waldhorn, timpani, bongos and the conga."</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from rubbish</seg>
<seg id="82">"more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero are the children of Cateura - a village that is located practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of AsunciÃ³n in Paraguay's capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material:"</seg>
<seg id="83">"music with remanufactured instruments, made of local solid waste materials, produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateurura, where the recyclers under the direction of Favio ChÃ¡vez began to transform parts of waste into instruments."</seg>
<seg id="84">"instruments imitate violins, violas, cellos, double bass, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion all produced out of the rubbish."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the repertoire includes classical music, folk music, Paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music from the Beatles, Frank Sinatra, etc."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in an article of the Los Angeles Times, Favio ChÃ¡vez, a local ecologist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls the beginning:"</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no room for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in trash The children didn't know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as Favio something that he had never seen before: a violin made from waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a whole orchestra playing instruments made of recycled material and which is called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentation called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) records the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">"every year, the world generates approximately one billion tons of waste."</seg>
<seg id="92">"those who live with him and from him are the poorest - like the people in Cateura, Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring performance of trash-to-music around the world.</seg>

<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork can successfully combat illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that combats wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">"this post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published by Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports on international, practical solutions for environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-release happens within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices to share content.</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa, it was known at that time that this ship had already run illegal fishing in Liberia's waters before it sought the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly upset and little inclined to welcome a law breaker of this kind on their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comores, Mozambique and the Seychelles were quickly mobilised against the ship."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries who simply refused everything," "recalls Benedict Kiilu, a senior employee of the Kenyan fishing authority. he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at its time."</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was then distributed from the waters of the region: it was not possible for him to catch fish there."</seg>
<seg id="105">"ultimately, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars in Liberia, because of looting the country's fish stocks."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal fishing stop)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries that then expelled the prime ministers from their waters."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" we have eight countries that are like-minded and work together. they exchange information and stand each other where it comes to illegal fishing, "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trusts project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project provides technical support for FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="109">"illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, therefore it is extremely difficult to detect. thus, illegal fishing is a main cause of overfishing of regions."</seg>
<seg id="110">"due to the deliberate disregard of existing laws, by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, illegal fishing may harm ecosystems that have a delicate balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but while actions against illegal fishing were once hampered by bureaucratic hurdles and also through the snail stamp, with which information circulated between individual countries, the actions are happening now in real time, traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"there the individual countries can exchange, for example, lists of existing licenses, news about suspicious activities or details that one had noticed or experienced during a harbour inspection."</seg>
<seg id="113">"fish-i also attends the activities of ships very attentive when they move on the open sea, via satellite data."</seg>
<seg id="114">"this allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in forbidden areas. also, such suspicious routes can be discovered - such as those suggesting that a ship invites its caught fish on the way to other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"ideally, such investigations show whether the participating ships have a fishing license where they were on the road and possibly also if they were a criminal."</seg>
<seg id="116">"on the basis of this information, countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse the adoption of such vessels in their ports. which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay penalties, as in the case of the prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it's about substantial financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="118">"this is what we want to achieve," "says Per Erik Bergh, director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm that advocates the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the already mentioned platform was created to reclaim estimated 20 million USD to lost revenue, which will lose the eight members of the HISH-i network every year because of illegal fishermen who enter East African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries in which the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="122">"such practices include sailing under false flag, fake license papers, specification of phantasy names, fish-protected species and fishing in nature reserves."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they deliberately exploit the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of a not completely organized control system," "says Long." "in the past, a ship was able to fish illegally and a country could say" You dared not go on my harbour. ""</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say "Come to me." and this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i now.</seg>
<seg id="125">"so far, the closed front works."</seg>
<seg id="126">"since its inception, FISH-i has participated in more than 30 studies of suspicious ships."</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks that had spread falsified licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has pursued and found escaping ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority to combat crime, FISH-i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime, "Bergh says."</seg>
<seg id="130">"he builds a system that will help FISH-i, locate suspicious ships more precisely."</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly being developed, also helps to track down the illegal ships that are happy to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position, "says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO which also deals with fishery data and provides technical support for FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="134">"some of the ships, for example, turn off their automatic identification systems with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites."</seg>
<seg id="135">"therefore, Copeland helps build a system that connects different levels of information. FISH-i shall help to find criminal ships with greater precision."</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations really influence the unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO skyTruth, believes that."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Sea Conservation Organisation (Oceana): a platform that provides satellite data and by means of which the position of each trackable ship can be displayed worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "together with the neighbors, to get a better picture of who is doing what is doing - that's simply meaning," "he says." "here is a chance for countries to unite and join their resources for investigation."</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this at a global level." "Pew Charitable Trust has to run a similar project where a global system allows the tracking of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">"there are signs that FISH-i's activities not only detect criminals, but also deter them."</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that were previously fishing without a license and had hardly to reckon with consequences are now aware that they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i have meanwhile recorded a 33% increase in fishing sales, since fishing boats buy more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia had helped to track Greko 1, the inspectors found towing nets where they were banned."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "says Kiilu." "we have become a study object." "in West Africa several hundred million dollars annually disappear through illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"there six countries joined together in 2015, the so-called West Africa Task Force. they also fight against illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH-i." "security is the goal of allowing even more of such initiatives and structures to be created in other regions," "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"only recently FISH-i's youngest member of Somalia could make their first big triumph: in October, it was Greko 1, a ship sailing under false flag."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also imbued in forbidden waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "by taking measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they proceed against illegal fishing," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i, this is another success of many. and at the same time the evidence that such a special, collaborative approach to the protection of the oceans really works throughout the world ocean. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London. there she writes about the environment, technology and nutrition."</seg>

<seg id="162">"Marianne DÃ­az, co-acting with Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises in her latest article the context of the government decision as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="163">"in the context of the social, political and economic crisis, where inflation and violence are among the highest in the world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% at the end of the year) and a serious and far-reaching lack of food and medicine, the referendum was considered the only way to give the country the chance to reconquer its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance."</seg>

<seg id="201">"in the trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, crimes were investigated which were committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship."</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano did not choose his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">"starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father right up to the brutal military operations in La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough."</seg>
<seg id="204">He kept the family secret for 34 years.</seg>
<seg id="205">"in the situation at that time, I believed that it was fine."</seg>

<seg id="208">"at that time I could not see that my father was a thief, torturer and murderer."</seg>
<seg id="209">"Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was a gendarmermaid. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a period of state terrorism, his father was the deputy commander of the intelligence department in La Perla from 1976 to 1978."</seg>

<seg id="221">Just watch out that they don't have to kidnap you one day and I must save you.</seg>
<seg id="222">"the abbreviation ERP stands for EjÃ©rcito Revolucionario del Pueblo, - Revolutionary People's Army - the military arm of the Revolutionary Workers' Party of Argentina."</seg>
<seg id="223">"that's why he forbade me to go back to the gym. a few days later, he took me to work on the military base."</seg>
<seg id="224">"he told me, I would become a secret."</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine.</seg>
<seg id="226">"on the military base, I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners."</seg>
<seg id="227">"these were all sorts of documents: university degrees, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda material, books, just everything."</seg>

<seg id="229">'cause the prisoners are tortured</seg>
<seg id="230">My father took me four times to La Perla with everything in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">At first and last time he let me wait at the entrance of the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">"when he took me for the second time, he ordered me to go out. he led me to a barracks, in the cars, furniture, TV, fridges - just everything possible."</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">"he gave me a little packet wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a big lump of silver in it."</seg>
<seg id="235">"on that day I went to the other end of the barracks, where the stolen objects were parked and kept me with a guard."</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">The prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">"I sped in, and saw a couch that was tortured to men."</seg>
<seg id="239">It looked like a field bed and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they attached the one end of a cable. the other end was attached to the person's body that was tied there.</seg>
<seg id="241">"they seldom put a man with handcuffs on the bed, overthrew him with water and chased him a charge of 220 volts in the genitals."</seg>
<seg id="242">Photo: ComisiÃ³n Provincial de la Memoria</seg>
<seg id="243">The stench there was horrific... like a dirty wine.</seg>
<seg id="244">"years later, when my father was under house arrest, the same smell came from his room."</seg>
<seg id="245">I instantly recognized the smell and it became clear to me that this is the smell of a body in need.</seg>
<seg id="246">I could never forget this odour.</seg>
<seg id="247">And I asked myself: how is it possible that a person can do so much harm to another?</seg>
<seg id="248">I knew these people were killed '</seg>
<seg id="249">"when my father took me to work for the third time, he led me to the entrance of La Cuadra - the area where the prisoners were bound and bound with handcuffs."</seg>
<seg id="250">"he spoke to" Chubi "Lopez (Jose LÃ³pez, a civilian who was also indicted in the trial) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cuadra."</seg>
<seg id="251">"in the background, I saw a number of mattresses on which naked people were lying with the face downward - all were tied at hands and feet."</seg>
<seg id="252">"near the entrance, people crouched quietly on the mattresses."</seg>
<seg id="253">"when my father saw that I saw the prisoners, he said," "What do you think so, asshole?"</seg>
<seg id="254">"I replied," "Why have you brought me otherwise?" ""</seg>
<seg id="255">I knew these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">They were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="257">I know that because my father told me at home.</seg>
<seg id="258">"in addition to La Cuadra, some rooms were designated as offices."</seg>
<seg id="259">I know that "Palito" Romero smote and killed a man there.</seg>
<seg id="260">"according to the survivors, the civil war Jorge Romero, who was also indicted in the La Perla-Ribera process, beaten the student RaÃºl Mateo Molina to death."</seg>
<seg id="261">"the following video shows Emilio Fessia, the head of the La Perla Memorial, through the former torture chambers."</seg>
<seg id="262">The way you came in here is also the way on which the abducts came here.</seg>
<seg id="263">"if you look on the map, you will see that they took about this path and then were tortured for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="264">Here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of dehumanization.</seg>
<seg id="265">"if they survived the torture, the prisoners were thrown into the cuadra until the order from above came that they should be laid."</seg>
<seg id="266">This was the lie - euphemism - for the shooting of men and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="267">The 'war of war'</seg>
<seg id="268">My father brought home all sorts of stolen things.</seg>
<seg id="269">"at that time I had no idea what the" "war spoils" "- as they called it - was."</seg>
<seg id="270">"but when I was in the military later, - I was in the gendarmerie - it became clear to me that war raids are a bayonet or perhaps military badges, which one takes off an enemy whom one has fought."</seg>

<seg id="273">"but if one goes to a house and the refrigerator, the record player, clothes, paintings, money... steals, then this is not war-yield, but vandalism."</seg>
<seg id="274">This is theft.</seg>
<seg id="275">"I have always wondered how my father, the leader of the security forces, could join this vandalism."</seg>
<seg id="276">I just don't understand it.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was also an officer at the gendarmerie and I would never have liked to enter a house and steal everything in it.</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my father could do that.</seg>
<seg id="279">"once he called me a criminal, and I answered," "You who are driving cars on the street?" ""</seg>
<seg id="280">You are not a criminal?</seg>
<seg id="281">"he exploded with rage, hit me and screamed:"</seg>
<seg id="282">"when you go so far, I will find you and kill you."</seg>
<seg id="283">We don't need anyone else to do that!</seg>
<seg id="284">So my father was.</seg>
<seg id="285">I have no good memory of him.</seg>
<seg id="286">"when I said in the process, I showed a photo from then on which I wore a jacket and a turtleneck pullover. both had my father from La Perla."</seg>
<seg id="287">"we were not poor, but he still brought clothes to his home."</seg>
<seg id="288">"at that time, the defence accused me of being a conspirator with this crime. I replied, no problem, they can lay down on me what they wanted."</seg>
<seg id="289">I was there anyway to testify.</seg>
<seg id="290">'the disappearance of corpses is the last abominable act '</seg>
<seg id="291">"now that I am older, I feel remorse."</seg>
<seg id="292">"I have children. once you have children, you can recognize the value of a life."</seg>
<seg id="293">One continues to develop and realize that it is wrong to kill.</seg>
<seg id="294">I even went so far to say:</seg>
<seg id="295">"well, you were executing people during the dictatorship, but why did the corpses disappear?"</seg>
<seg id="296">Why kidnap children?</seg>
<seg id="297">"one day, my father brought a girl home, whose mother had been killed."</seg>
<seg id="298">"she was like our pet, almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl."</seg>
<seg id="299">"I always asked myself the question: they were tortured, but why were they killed?"</seg>
<seg id="300">They could have simply put them into prison.</seg>
<seg id="301">"I guess it was just decided to kill these people, but why their corpses disappear?"</seg>
<seg id="302">Did these people not even have families to whom one could hand over their mortal remains?</seg>
<seg id="303">The disappearance of corpses is the last abominable act that one can do to a person.</seg>
<seg id="304">"my father told me when the democracy was introduced, they brought machines to remove the mortal remnants of the prisoners."</seg>
<seg id="305">"they were crushed and disposed of somewhere - no idea where." you will never find anything, "my father said."</seg>
<seg id="306">"but, of course, something remains."</seg>
<seg id="307">I've seen how you killed people!</seg>
<seg id="308">Only to clarify it: I have nothing against the military.</seg>
<seg id="309">I was even in the gendarmerie.</seg>
<seg id="310">I just said the truth about 20 criminals - including my father.</seg>
<seg id="311">The thought of showing my father arose during a conversation when he was placed under house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="312">I reproached him for all the atrocities I had to experience because of him.</seg>
<seg id="313">"then he suddenly said," "I don't know. I have killed anyone." ""</seg>
<seg id="314">"I felt inwardly rejected and asked myself what all the exaggerated patriotism and the" Western and Christian feelings "they allegedly defended, were good."</seg>
<seg id="315">Then I screamed:</seg>
<seg id="316">How can you tell me?</seg>
<seg id="317">I saw how you killed people!</seg>
<seg id="318">You committed terrible crimes and you were forced to join me as a child.</seg>
<seg id="319">"he replied," "Well, let me tell you." ""</seg>
<seg id="320">This is exactly what I did.</seg>
<seg id="321">"in 2010, I reported the first ad."</seg>
<seg id="322">Finally I realized that he was a criminal.</seg>
<seg id="323">Nobody can reproach me that I am preoccupied. I finally said against my own father.</seg>

<seg id="353">"" "how could it come to such an English translation?"</seg>

<seg id="355">"this is an insult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto," "said Holmes."</seg>
<seg id="356">"the faulty English translation was first removed. the term" "bad drivers" "was later replaced by the appropriate, if also grammatically not quite correct name" elder drivers "(German:" older drivers ")."</seg>
<seg id="357">"the Kyoto prefecture was sorry for translation errors. furthermore, she explained that the error was already contained in the text they received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published."</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows on the apology:</seg>
<seg id="359">"we are really sorry that older people felt offended by the inadequate correction (the translation) on our part," "said the police."</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News made a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of "terrible" older drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">"the word" "terrible" "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older motorists. according to the police, the proportion of older motorists who are embroiled in accidents in the country are quite a cause of concern."</seg>
<seg id="362">"in Kyoto prefecture, for example, 1,941 of a total of 19,460 accidents were caused by seniors in 2005. this corresponds to a share of 10%."</seg>
<seg id="363">"ten years later, in 2014, seniors generated 1,803 of a total of 11,850 accidents."</seg>
<seg id="364">"as a result, their share rose to 17.7%."</seg>
<seg id="365">"while the number of accidents decreased overall, the proportion of accidents caused by seniors has increased in the same period."</seg>
<seg id="366">"the so-called reporter introduced comments to light in the version of the article published on Yahoo, which show what prejudices some Japanese apparently heap against older drivers:"</seg>
<seg id="367">"the article on Yahoo across the translation mistake received, among other things, the following comments:"</seg>
<seg id="368">"-" "Is this (" "dreadful motorists" ") about not reality?"</seg>
<seg id="369">"-" "So faulty is the translation not at all, isn't it?" ""</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">"for translating, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the initial text and active language skills in order to transfer it to the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">"the latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case in native speakers. generally, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - should be native speakers."</seg>
<seg id="379">"for example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from the French into English."</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies do not employ English as their native language, translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translating, cost reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers that learn Japanese."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies that do not have a foreign workforce allow translations to be produced in-house. then, the Japanese staff, whose English knowledge is considered to be the best, is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are."</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation is also widespread - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"the confused and enigmatic sentences, which arise through machine translation, show that this technique can not replace a human translator for a long time. this applies to some languages quite special."</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the puzzling prints that often decorate t-shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood."</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">"translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry. but from large companies or government that have the means to ensure higher standards, one can expect more careful translations."</seg>
<seg id="389">"in the future, the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more reputable source for their translations."</seg>

<seg id="394">"other online broadcasters also carried photographs of the protests in Caracas, organized by opposition groups, which oppose the government of NicolÃ¡s Maduros."</seg>
<seg id="395">"the protests began at the beginning of April, after the Supreme Court dissolved parliament and transferred the Parliament's duties to the executive and the Supreme Court."</seg>

<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before her graduation at the university she once again returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"the one that has become something," "she said."</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">"when she was ten years old she began working as Criadita for the family. as Criaditas, in Paraguay, the more than 46.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school."</seg>
<seg id="423">"the business is quite simple: a large family with little money transfers her underage son or her minor daughter to another, richer family. in exchange, the child receives food, training and a roof over the head."</seg>
<seg id="424">"what is not mentioned, however, is that the children have to pay for it countless days of housework that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can become - and all this within the framework of a contract that cannot be raised."</seg>
<seg id="425">"this practice, referred to as Criadazgo, is widespread in Paraguay due to its participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organizations."</seg>
<seg id="426">"after completing her studies, Alvarenga worked for a number of years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls."</seg>
<seg id="427">"she spoke with Criaditas - especially young girls were affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collecting testimonies, researching and denouncing."</seg>
<seg id="428">"she tried to name things by name, as the feeling of gratitude that is inoculated with the critique will generally be silent."</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga. "</seg>
<seg id="430">"on the one hand, the family, who has her daughter in faith, is able to complete her education, improve her position in society and" "make something out of herself" "to another family."</seg>
<seg id="431">"on the other hand, the family who receives the girl with him and whose exploitation is justified by faith is that they give someone a chance that otherwise would not receive education and maybe even starved."</seg>
<seg id="432">The victims of Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">"when the girl is mistreated, his family will learn about it many years later."</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never even learn about it.</seg>
<seg id="435">"in January 2016, the previously unknown phenomenon, which takes place in the hidden in paraguayan households, got a face."</seg>
<seg id="436">"when Carolina MarÃ­n came to the hospital in CaaguazÃº, her body showed signs of violent blows. shortly afterwards she died."</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">"she was Criadita in the household of the former military officer TomÃ¡s Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as a civil servant at the Einwohnermeldeamt."</seg>
<seg id="439">"MarÃ­n lived with them in her house in VaquerÃ­a, a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital AsunciÃ³n."</seg>
<seg id="440">"at the end of January 2016, Ferreira attacked MarÃ­n with a cane until she suffered deadly injuries."</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">"a few days later, the media reported about the incident."</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a cricket.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organisations such as UNICEF or Callescuela accounted for the practice of Criadazgo for the death of the girl deeply rooted in the Paraguayan society.</seg>
<seg id="445">They called the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came together to protest in protest and demanded that there was "no other Carolina" in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photos were widely used in social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay, more cows are registered as children," "Tina Alvarenga complains."</seg>
<seg id="449">"without papers, it is much easier to violate the rights of children."</seg>
<seg id="450">"without official documents, it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live."</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbors of the married couple and almost 60 civil society organisations demanded a rapid investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want TomÃ¡s Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="453">"if the case comes before the Court, the case of Carolina MarÃ­n might be directional - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Criadazgo comes in court."</seg>

<seg id="455">"the Criaditas are not only exploited as labour power, they also live isolated from other girls in their age."</seg>
<seg id="456">"Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik, in which her father worked, had to opt-in bankruptcy and her father lost his work."</seg>
<seg id="457">"their brothers now had to go to work, and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to earn money."</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went further to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent to the capital AsunciÃ³n as Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="460">"in the house of their employers, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours every day."</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to divide the time in such a way that she could still have time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She stood at five o'clock every morning and prepared breakfast for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">"for example, she cleaned the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor."</seg>
<seg id="464">"when the school was over, she went home again and had time to learn."</seg>
<seg id="465">"the sooner she finished learning, the more free time she had."</seg>

<seg id="500">Picture of Pixabay modified by Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="501">Published under the Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">"sixty Egyptian Parliamentary Committees recently agreed to draft legislation on" "the regulation of use and benefits of social networks". ""</seg>
<seg id="503">"when it is adopted by the Parliament, users of social media in Egypt must register with a government agency in order to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="504">"on the basis of the law, a place would then be established that is mandated to give citizens permission to use social media."</seg>
<seg id="505">"within six months with the adoption of the law, users would have to register on the website of the site with their proper names and ID numbers in order to be able to use social networks."</seg>
<seg id="506">"if this fails to do so, this could bring a penalty of up to six months imprisonment or a fine."</seg>
<seg id="507">"the bill, which consists of six paragraphs and curses in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as" any application that runs over the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice, video alignment and text. "</seg>
<seg id="508">"it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is adopted, as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities can impose the registration. it is not clear how they should account for those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is not currently able to ensure regulation on the level of social media companies."</seg>
<seg id="509">"Riyad Abdul Sattar, Parliamentary deputy and promoter of the bill, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users received a username and password from the telecommunications ministry to get through the firewall that blocks Facebook."</seg>
<seg id="510">"this could mean that Egypt plans to build a firewall on a national level around Facebook. due to that, it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information about their identity in order to access the network."</seg>
<seg id="511">But so far it is not known that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts on site are sceptical about the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">"Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist (in German" senior research technologist ") at the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German" Egypt Initiative for Personal Rights "), told Global Voices:"</seg>
<seg id="514">I doubt the technical capacity and understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">"in my opinion, they imagine that just as they violently control physical public and private spaces, it could also be done online."</seg>
<seg id="516">"if I take them seriously, it means they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who seek permission or not. and that is a crazy system to monitor people's activities and also to lead them to a trial."</seg>
<seg id="517">"this is technically not realistic, but in Egypt everything is possible."</seg>
<seg id="518">"" "to be passed as a law, the draft must first be discussed at the Parliament's legislative and constitutional committees, before it enters the plenary debate."</seg>
<seg id="519">"whether his acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not, the draft is in line with a pro-military way of thinking in parliament, in whose sense the control is maximized and it should be ensured that no deviating narration is present on the screen," says Raoof. "</seg>

<seg id="527">Why is this specific type of leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">"as Raza shows in the video," "the Persian leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem" "and the health and the flourishing of the ecosystem also depends on a large predator."</seg>
<seg id="529">"the chance to see a Persian leopard in the free wilderness is small and goes against zero. as the team in the video determines that they have a recording of a big cat in the camerawoman, Raza breaks out in pure joy."</seg>

<seg id="544">"a huge earthquake, tsunami and an nuclear accident in Fukushima had caused the catastrophe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, located in the prefecture of Miyagi. the prefecture of Miyagi was an important prefecture in Japan's Northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami."</seg>
<seg id="546">"hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring prefectures Fukushima and Iwate were forced to evacuate, because the tsunami had caused entire coastal cities to disappear from the map."</seg>
<seg id="547">"for this reason, the prefecture of Fukushima experienced a nuclear accident, already alone that 160 000 people had to leave their homes."</seg>
<seg id="548">"the special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows, from a local point of view, what progress has been achieved six years after, in order to rebuild the lives of the local residents."</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics from the Japanese rebuilding authority as well as survey results of the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">"housing construction in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate"</seg>
<seg id="551">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that by December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses (on the outskirts of Saigai kouei juutaku) were completed in the prefectures of Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate."</seg>
<seg id="552">"the biggest success among the three prefectures was Miyagi, where 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed."</seg>
<seg id="553">"Iwate completed 75 percent of such homes, whereas Fukushima with 70 percent forms the final light."</seg>
<seg id="554">"however, even six years after the catastrophe, it is still endeavouring to relocate evacuation of residential accommodation (to the" "caetsu juchaku" ") in final replacement houses."</seg>
<seg id="555">"after the threefold catastrophe nearly 80,000 people saw themselves forced to live in shelters."</seg>
<seg id="556">"in December 2016 more than 36,000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such homes."</seg>
<seg id="557">"almost 40 percent of the evacuated people in Fukushima in 2011 still live in emergency shelters, while Miyagi was more successful. more than 75 per cent of the evacuated people who were homeless in shelters were relocated into final houses."</seg>
<seg id="558">"for Iwate, the figure is 34 percent."</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">"as the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper was able to determine, 1074 of 1100 schools that were affected by disaster have reopened their doors by December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools in the three prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="561">"six years later, industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult."</seg>
<seg id="562">"while nearly 100 per cent of the fishing harbours in Iwate and Miyagi are in operation, only 30 percent of the fishing harbours have resumed their operations in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="563">"in the three prefectures of the agrarian country, the tsunami and the nuclear accident have suffered large-scale farming."</seg>
<seg id="564">"Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 percent of the agricultural land in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed agricultural land in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="565">"it is unlikely that this is just a consequence of the nuclear accident, as only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of land destroyed by Fukushima are located in the" nuclear barrier zone. ""</seg>
<seg id="566">"in two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered largely, but here too Fukushima remains far removed."</seg>
<seg id="567">"the tourist figures in Miyagi and Iwate are up to 90 percent on the same level, as before the misfortune. Fukushima, on the other hand, can show only 75 percent here."</seg>
<seg id="568">"however, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal dwellers, it is more difficult to earn their livelihood."</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population prepared for the next great earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">"in order to obtain an overall picture, the newspaper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and the evacuation."</seg>
<seg id="571">"in her introduction to the article, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:"</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami consciousness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents took measures to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">"however, 55.9 per cent of the respondents find that still not enough in things disaster prevention was done."</seg>
<seg id="575">How it is about those who had to be evacuated from the Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">"in her issue on the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the evacuated people from Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="577">"Fukushima had to experience not only the enormous earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima prefecture was also witness to the worst, disaster-induced nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed."</seg>
<seg id="578">"of 160,000 Evacuantes from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were transferred to areas outside the prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="579">"at the beginning of 2016 some more than 23,000 people were transferred back to Fukushima, in permanent replacement houses."</seg>
<seg id="580">"after the 2017 stand still 40,000 inhabitants of Fukushima live outside their home prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="581">"in the disaster areas most of the evacuated ones, who still live in residential shelters, are older than 50 years old. they are known to fail because the efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima will compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020."</seg>

<seg id="629">"after the earthquake, the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory gradually lost its plants until only the rumours of steel and concrete remained."</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to reinvent themselves.</seg>

<seg id="639">"the message would have been a motive for the country a few decades ago, but the bad harvests are no news anymore."</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old platform of the municipality already saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">"the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated, and hardly competitive they were unsustainable for the country."</seg>
<seg id="644">"the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tonnes."</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories which can produce sugar for maximum 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution to unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of the sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>

<seg id="692">"young people from the First Nations communities all over Canada are dealing with topics that are important to them. they do it with hip-hop, thanks to a number of hiking workshops."</seg>
<seg id="693">"as part of the N 'we Jinan-Tour, workshop leaders have been bringing mobile audio studios to schools and youth centres since 2014, in order to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances."</seg>
<seg id="694">"the original workshops were led by the pedagogue David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in North-Quebec with ten Cree communities and then collaborated with the Cree Hip-Hop-Group The NorthStars."</seg>
<seg id="695">"the workshop is thus increasing that the young participants learn about topics such as" cultural identity, language, debate, love, self-acceptance "or whatever comes to mind."</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the protagonists.</seg>
<seg id="697">"because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Winnebago in the U.S. state of Nebraska."</seg>
<seg id="698">"this video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'Yoo in the area of the tribe of the Kitebkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called" Highway of tears, "a section in western Canada, where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered."</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely not solved.</seg>
<seg id="700">"the next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs, despite the influences of globalisation."</seg>
<seg id="701">"many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the youths do not always know the languages of the First Nations."</seg>
<seg id="702">"in the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the refrain is sung on Cree."</seg>
<seg id="703">"the young people involved got some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars hip-hop group, who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cree dialect."</seg>
<seg id="704">"on the Facebook page of N'we Jinan, the stanza is available in Umschrift, as well as a translation into English, which is translated into German here:"</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like no one ever is interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to continue my days on earth</seg>
<seg id="707">That is the day when you will take our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we as youth have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe we will rise one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see plastic dishes almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">"to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu, are displayed near the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (the" "plastic models of the dishes" ") of each food served in this restaurant."</seg>
<seg id="720">The customers see themselves in these plastic dishes and then decide if they enter the restaurant or continue.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">"there are a variety of small businesses in the Tokyo district of Kappabashi, which produce those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="723">"for most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so common that they don't even notice them any more. however, a new trend is turning them into showy mobile accessories and other gadgets today."</seg>
<seg id="724">"at Naver Matome, the blogger itinii published a number of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru."</seg>
<seg id="725">"now in special sales: new mobile tapes decorated with plastic, as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store."</seg>
<seg id="726">"many of these artificial foods have been transformed into kitsch collection objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:"</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shokuhin cooling cabinet magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in food supplements is becoming increasingly more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">"in this case, kaisen-don (a popular rice dish with seafood) was turned into a mobile support."</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile support.</seg>
<seg id="731">We have also produced this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">"designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is a great design."</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is only the beginning of an increasing flight into the comical.</seg>
<seg id="735">"some mobile support and mobile phone designers allow you to make your own work of art. in this case, ikura or laughed-swine is used, a popular topping that is served with white rice."</seg>
<seg id="736">"on Twitter, some users had their doubts:"</seg>
<seg id="737">"is there someone who would say:" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile phone with laughing?" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I'll be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">"this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appetizing form, for example to surprise colleagues or family members."</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile phone stand has the form of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">"in addition, we also offer rice balls (onigiri), earrings and handytapes of dried salmon."</seg>

<seg id="749">"in reports of domestic and foreign media about the infamous" "fighting against drug trafficking" "in Mexico, the mixed and killed regularly appear only in statistics. however, these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle entails."</seg>
<seg id="750">"reporting on drug bosses such as El Chapo GuzmÃ¡n, the head of the Sinaloa cartel, pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background."</seg>
<seg id="751">"on the day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the bereaved or the churches that have learned to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="752">"behind every body, behind each bone find find hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed."</seg>
<seg id="753">"for this reason, the Mexican news portal Animal PolÃ­tico has launched the digital project" Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco. ""</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal PolÃ­tico describes the project like this:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime does not just let us fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are far more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">"for example, if businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and whole communities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk."</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of the victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video entitled "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" (German: "how fear is changing life") tells exactly these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">"a main character is Guadalupe, a father who searches for secret tombs after his son every weekend."</seg>
<seg id="761">"Emma Veleta RodrÃ­guez, who lost her father, her four brothers, her husband and two of her nephew on just one day."</seg>
<seg id="762">"priests:" "like every Sunday, we prepare ourselves today for the task that we have asked ourselves to go and to graves, to the people we have loved."</seg>
<seg id="763">Guadalupe Contreras: "my son is called Antonio Ivan Contreras Mata.</seg>

<seg id="767">On 13 October he left the house.</seg>
<seg id="768">"on October 15th he should be back again, but he never returned." Emma Veleta: "it's very hard for me, because I am now alone with three children who need education."</seg>
<seg id="769">"there is also my mother, who is here with me too."</seg>
<seg id="770">At the moment she has no income.</seg>
<seg id="771">"you are entitled to the insurance of my father, but they do not pay them out because they demand a death certificate."</seg>
<seg id="772">Where should we get this? "</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a vivir con el Narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">"we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, fragility and state leadership."</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports from journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">"KYHB, a reader of Animal PolÃ­tico, wrote this article from Taxco, in the federal state of Guerrero in Central Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="778">"their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal, no matter what form it occurs:"</seg>
<seg id="779">I have been familiar with disease and sensationalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">"every day, I come by newspaper kiosks and see the front pages with images that can only come from a textbook for criminology or from experts from specialists."</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the frame.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one that is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent to this or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (German: drug dealers) if he is big. and it's not normal that people listen to songs about the" heroic deeds "of the offenders when they go through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me, this is as if they ridicule those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something has happened to them."</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"the inaction of the people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified with the fact that they were" "soaked". ""</seg>
<seg id="789">"I think they try to persuade themselves to be spared from such tragedies, if they do not stir and remain silent."</seg>
<seg id="790">"Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article" Four months blackmail in the capital district: how a family was looted with threats, "she describes how armed criminals forced money from their business for month until they destroyed not only the business, but also tore their family apart."</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">"pain never passes, the trauma stays, the fear comes up again when you are alone."</seg>
<seg id="793">"habits have changed, phone numbers too."</seg>
<seg id="794">We will only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">"the farther we are away from each other, the better."</seg>
<seg id="796">She closed her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">"we want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they will kidnap or kill you."</seg>
<seg id="798">"in these terrible days I asked if tears would dissolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I must learn to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="799">"Mario GutiÃ©rrez Vega published the article" "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez: a Generation of Violence." ""</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement at the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">"he is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care about them."</seg>
<seg id="803">"Bryan is an orphan and he tells us how to cook an egg, cook potatoes, make tortillas warm and make" Chichi "for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water, sugar and milk powder."</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for each year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared."</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">"his childhood had passed two years before, when he saw only a few blocks from his home, the bloody corpse of his father, who had been shot by armed men from a passing car."</seg>
<seg id="809">"when Bryan was born, the situation in JuÃ¡rez looked like this:"</seg>
<seg id="810">"Bryan was born in 2006, as violence by organised crime and the fight against it mixed with the already existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez."</seg>
<seg id="811">"in 2008, 2009 and 2010, JuÃ¡rez was the most dangerous city in the world because of the number of murders according to the citizens' council for public security and government of the United States government."</seg>
<seg id="812">"in 2010 alone, the public prosecutor called 3103 murders. this corresponds to the average of 8,5 murders per day."</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">"only a few stories continue to live in the face of ever new headlines, but this project reminds us of those who are not allowed to forget."</seg>
<seg id="815">"in addition to the project" Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco, "Animal PolÃ­tico launched the data journalism project Narcodata, whose objective is to portray the complex information behind the failed battle against drug trade, which has tormented the country over the past four decades."</seg>

<seg id="820">Let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>

<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for pictures and messages.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">"in 2010, a tank truck crossed the village of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, collapsed and exploded. 230 people died."</seg>
<seg id="826">"after the civil war, Africa's second largest country has been neglected for years and thus devastated. the streets in the region have become dangerous pathways full of potholes that were difficult to navigate."</seg>
<seg id="827">"tragically, the tank wagon fell victim to it."</seg>
<seg id="828">"officials described a fireball, which enveloped dozens of houses including a cinemas nearby, which was full of people who looked at the football world championships."</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses burned and charted corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burnt to infinity.</seg>
<seg id="831">"a picture entitled" This is Nigeria. "from the Imgur User Mystical Monkey, January 12, 2015.Several photos of the incident illustrate the dreadful scenes of this day."</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of charted bodies lined up on the ground while people look at it.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not end its end.</seg>
<seg id="835">"over the years the same photo was repeated several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and wrongly attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">"on 3 January 2015, combatants of Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon."</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastically about atrocities they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and corpses were lying in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">"there were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred."</seg>
<seg id="841">"but the figures could not be confirmed." "no one left behind to count corpses," "said a citizen to Human Rights Watch."</seg>
<seg id="842">"many were dismembered, shot or burned."</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite images the follow-up time could be depicted visually.</seg>
<seg id="844">"the cause for the attack was also unsolved, but the military base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military of Nigeria and the attempt of Boko Haram to win the country (examples from 2013 and 2015)."</seg>
<seg id="845">"and here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again, as it was falsely presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:"</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">"a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris."</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">"in fact, this abusive use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a series of abortions; Africa Check has documented regulations on Nigeria since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="851">"in all these cases, the picture was presented as a cover for mass killings."</seg>
<seg id="852">"one step further, personal comments such as this example wrongly bring the image from DR Congo to sources of mass media in order to deliver arguments."</seg>
<seg id="853">The image from Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">"according to a lightning report, published by the United Nations, those who were fleeing could flee, rape and several dead, some by burning."</seg>
<seg id="855">"while others reported about the violence against Rohingya, Posts appeared like the following who brought these descriptions together with photos from DR Congo:"</seg>
<seg id="856">"this image comes from an Saudi Arabian news site, which falsely claimed to be President Myanmar's Than Being, monks and politicians allegedly participated in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, they used the image from DR Congo to capture this information."</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames (frames) that pass through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in relation to greater discussions about silence in connection with the killings of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the assassinations of Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the picture to discuss how an African life is undervalued compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">"to understand religion and the value of human life is important. therefore, it is worthwhile to examine how images are used in connection with these efforts."</seg>
<seg id="932">"a deeper question is, however, what happens when readers can no longer believe these images."</seg>
<seg id="933">"with social media, there are tens of people who inadvertently have a share of the water around a tragedy."</seg>
<seg id="934">"this mood of mis- and falsehood suggests that actual atrocities are untrue and diminish the real horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?"</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of forcible pictures has already been extensively debated (here for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">"one argument is that the retention of images of a refusal is equivalent to acknowledging the tragedy. occasionally, these images are even demanded by the victims themselves."</seg>
<seg id="937">"at the same time, the concern is that violent pictures sensitize readers and viewers and take the ability to feel empathy (such as this study, which investigated how forcible media works to help others)."</seg>
<seg id="938">"while there is a lot to discuss with violent portrayals in the news media, it is a fact that they are indispensable for today's news reporting."</seg>
<seg id="939">"technologists are experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against" fake news. "they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something, which can actually be solved by context or in an entirely abusive way."</seg>
<seg id="940">"however, each examination of false attributions should also take into account how internationally they can be."</seg>

<seg id="1135">"story telling, by Flickr users Daniele Rossi, using the license CC BY-NC-ND 2.0."</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be a possibility here and now in connection with someone in spite of a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">"Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, the founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling initiative (TLS), is a possible answer to the number of stories in their original language."</seg>
<seg id="1138">"recently, Global Voices reported on a different initiative by Steven Bird, the unrivalled blog."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written word but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the diversity of languages of large cities."</seg>
<seg id="1140">"in fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in Oakland in the United States where TLS has already conducted events since 2015, the risk that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there."</seg>
<seg id="1141">The following applies to the makers of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">"the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities, accept diversity - secure spaces in which people don't have to forget who they are to belong."</seg>
<seg id="1143">"while" listening often is linked to understanding "these events, instead," listening to appreciate, feel, socialize. ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">"in this format, storytellers represent their history first in their own language and translate or explain them in English."</seg>
<seg id="1145">"even if the participants are not a professional story teller, their devotion and their representation entail that the audience is insisting on it."</seg>
<seg id="1146">"they call forth laughter and emotions, as the language is no longer a barrier."</seg>
<seg id="1147">"the following video shows, for example, a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language of Dafing. during this turn, the storyteller Rassidatou Konate takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical of her country."</seg>
<seg id="1148">"in another event, John Nyamoara tells the fables of the rabbit and the baboons in the language of Shona from Zimbabwe:"</seg>
<seg id="1149">"after explaining the meaning of his fables, John Nyamonara is asked:" how is this to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language? "with a wide grin he shares his sense of inclusiveness:"</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened to!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">"until now, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organisers hope to extend it. all who are inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own story narrative."</seg>

<seg id="1155">"with the aim of a reexamination of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amounted to 72 million US dollars, various religious and civil organisations took part in a mass demonstration last 3 April 2017; the march started at the Mexican Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went to the Plaza de ColÃ³n in the old town of San Juans."</seg>
<seg id="1156">"it was summoned by the group" Frente Ciudadano por la AuditorÃ­a de la Deuda "(Citizens front for the neural checking of debt), and the church meeting of Puerto Ricos."</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of the refixing of debt also filed a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>

<seg id="1161">We are pressed and oppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people of Puerto Ricos refuse to pay a debt that is not theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>

<seg id="1167">"for this reason, the so-called" Centre for New Economy, "a non-profit non-profit organization without party affiliation, focuses on socio-economic development, a law on state responsibility, as an alternative to existing state supervision."</seg>
<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>

<seg id="1187">"the book, which was published last year and is available royalty free here, contains a series of essays dealing with free culture in the face of oppression."</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a tribute to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is called:</seg>
<seg id="1190">"this book aims to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built up, and what are the real costs associated with it."</seg>
<seg id="1191">"activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to create some sense of our different experiences."</seg>
<seg id="1192">"this book is an attempt to liberate Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was removed from the directory of the Adra prison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">"since then, we have no information about his current state or whereabouts."</seg>
<seg id="1195">"the introductory part of his book, entitled" "Collective Remembrance" "gives his friends and his family a voice calling for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom."</seg>
<seg id="1196">"seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us have let us start thinking about their own destinies, actions and decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of occasionally extreme convictions?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for Open Source and Digital activist has been in the custody of Syrian government authorities since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">"in October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military institution, to an unknown location."</seg>
<seg id="1202">"his wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the" military police "had taken part in Adra as a" strictly secret "command of the military tribunal in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">"Ghazi reported that on November 12, 2015, they were contacted by persons who presented themselves as insiders of the Assad administration and informed them of an alleged death sentence against their husband."</seg>
<seg id="1204">"however, his whereabouts and condition remain unknown."</seg>
<seg id="1205">"a pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in extending access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria."</seg>
<seg id="1206">"Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and currently the director of New Palmyra, a project called Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:"</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Basle's cultural prototypes was more foreward than the work that he began with a group of archeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">"Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crossroads of numerous civilizations and here fuse Greek-Roman architectural models with local traditions and Persian influences."</seg>
<seg id="1209">"at that time Bassel could not know that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would put everything on it, this architecture that embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world."</seg>
<seg id="1210">This journey into digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule which will be invaluable for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">"tragically, Bassel could not finish this project yet."</seg>
<seg id="1212">"Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about her husband's passion to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:"</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my whole life of dreaming of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">"Bassel taught me English, even when he was already in jail."</seg>
<seg id="1216">"I have learned to read, write and speak English well."</seg>
<seg id="1217">"he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked. he taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English."</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">"he also taught other prisoners how to use computers, at least theoretically without actually holding one in their hands."</seg>
<seg id="1221">"Ghazi is also the author of waiting (waiting), a professorship that she wrote to her husband in 2012 and 2015 when he was in custody."</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together on the book for one year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic to English.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is available royalty free.</seg>

<seg id="1226">The book is dedicated to public domain.</seg>

<seg id="1230">"that I lose the reflection in the moment we embrace,"</seg>
<seg id="1231">"that every danger doesn't matter to me,"</seg>

<seg id="1239">"to bring back all the moments,"</seg>
<seg id="1240">And to cry and smile about your absence.</seg>
<seg id="1241">I persuade myself that I will return soon...</seg>

<seg id="1248">"since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against the Bashar al-Assad regime, more than 65,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian Network for Human Rights)."</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or disappeared under violence by the regime were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">"by 2016, according to the international human rights organisation Amnesty International, at least 17,723 Syrians have died in prison since 2011."</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1252">The Global Voices community has been calling for the release of Bassel since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1253">Today we repeat our demand in the hope that we must do this for the last time.</seg>
<seg id="1254">"Mozambique: convicted, convicted of corruption, after release on previous post"</seg>
<seg id="1255">"with anger he reacted to a corruption case in which a government member returned to the workplace in the state apparatus after half of his sentence, in which the corruption was committed."</seg>
<seg id="1256">"this is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison in 2010 along with four other defendants."</seg>
<seg id="1257">"the money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique, whose advice was given by Cambaza between 2005 and 2008."</seg>
<seg id="1258">"Cambaza was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately called for his re-adjustment to the company, which happened on April 19."</seg>
<seg id="1259">"in accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic who rejected the request, there would be no obstacle for Cambaza to re-refer his old post, as the company did not carry out disciplinary proceedings after his detention."</seg>
<seg id="1260">"however, many inhabitants do not mean the action well."</seg>
<seg id="1261">"in an interview with Deutsche Welle, the Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade PÃºblica, CIP) condemned the company's decision to re-establish the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle:"</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards in view of the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP."</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that the company should also have initiated a disciplinary procedure against the contrary.</seg>
<seg id="1264">"the company, however, seems to be silent and does not undertake appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions."</seg>
<seg id="1265">"EgÃ­dio Vaz, a significant voice in the Muslim social media, also rejects this behavior and considers the case as" resounding ":"</seg>
<seg id="1266">"if Cambaza was a competent guy, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of whom had dinner."</seg>
<seg id="1267">"he could hold paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish his image."</seg>
<seg id="1268">"but since he is incompetent, he has agreed to be reintegrated into the company, which he helped to inflict damage."</seg>
<seg id="1269">"therefore, it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for its silence."</seg>
<seg id="1270">Disgusting!</seg>
<seg id="1271">"Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil, says the director does not possess any moral:"</seg>
<seg id="1272">"Cambaza is rewarded by the state, because he insulted him. I can't believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that has so heavily insulted the state."</seg>
<seg id="1273">"Cambaza lacks morality and serves to serve the state, but has already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but has only served itself on the state."</seg>
<seg id="1274">"Cambaza used the state as though it was an inexhaustible source of money, and the state itself has become tired of this man who was accused and finally sentenced to a long prison term."</seg>
<seg id="1275">"honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded."</seg>
<seg id="1276">"Franey ZeÃºte prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, that a thief is in prison:"</seg>
<seg id="1277">"thieves are part of the Samora Mahel prison and will not only be remembered by the Moslem people as the first independent president, but also as a sharp, one-edged and - incidentally - prophesied."</seg>
<seg id="1278">"one of his most famous oral representations was when he vigorously confirmed that" "an ambitious man is capable of selling also the fatherland for his ambitions, his own individual interest."</seg>
<seg id="1279">"Samora also said:" I don't know if an ambitious person changes, my experience shows that this is not so. he changes tactics but he does not turn away from his ambitions. "</seg>
<seg id="1280">An ambitious person is criminal at the same time. "</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook blocks the racist word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censors many users</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Burmese word "Kalar pae" means chickpeas or splitting basses.</seg>
<seg id="1288">"photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported"</seg>
<seg id="1289">"according to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts from the network because they contained the word 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an adjective" Indian. ""</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook censored the word" Kalar "or" "Calar" "(in Burmese script) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">"in recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely depreciative connotation."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"Kalar 'may normally be associated with racism, but the word itself does not automatically cause hate speech."</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that even posts, in which they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubt for its use, have been censored."</seg>
<seg id="1297">"in addition, there are several Burmese words with different meanings that have the same character sequence as' Kalar '."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, chair on Burmese is also written 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (splitter bse), 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The faceboogin Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post to one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">"however, he had asked his friends in a witty way, if they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a pun."</seg>
<seg id="1302">"the phrase" "cure" "(ku) + the question (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression very much, but the context is completely different."</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"Zin Win Htet believes that it will reduce hate speech by radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook should be more analytical just before all posts that are suspected of spreading racism."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism will not understand what you write to Facbeook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">"what it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and control it by checking the words" "next". ""</seg>
<seg id="1309">"for example," Kalar Htine "(chair) and" Kalar pae. ""</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good thing is that these dirty nationalists, who spread hate speech, get a pretty good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise its nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action may send a strong signal to all who hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experiences of social networks in China like Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks simply begin to use a new word or alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to clear his posts when he only wanted to communicate his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banished from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">"when I became aware of this new policy from Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically, my post from Facebook was removed and I was not allowed to distribute the songs, posts and parts of content for 24 hours, because the post" "didn't meet the Facebook community standards". ""</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"in the post, the author shared his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism are bad in the country."</seg>
<seg id="1321">"Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example, the Burmese Internet community asking for advice:"</seg>
<seg id="1322">"Facebook may have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma through its platform, but it does not work."</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will bring only more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"in addition, it seems that they have started this without local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as" "chair" "or" "pea curry". ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">"even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the falsified Posts."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"if they only have a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that give them a big turnover, that would be great."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"" "Facebook's automatic censorship has caused much ridicule among users."</seg>
<seg id="1328">"instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the network."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts that did not contain any hate speech, but were nevertheless removed:"</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text reads "I want to sit on a chair and eat peas curry and watch an Indian movie.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Just to try out if Facebook is removing the mail containing the word Kalar.</seg>

<seg id="1334">"the post states" If you are a doctor, do you heal people? ""</seg>
<seg id="1335">"screenshot, used with permission."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"over the last five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists have used social networks to expand their voices and influence."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"among other things, hate speech in social networks should also incite violence in the communities in Myanmar, especially in the Rakhine area, where clashes between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"for his failure, Facebook was criticised for his failure to take control of the fraudulent hate speech on his Burmese parties."</seg>
<seg id="1339">"but instead of simply censoring the word" Kalar, "it would have been better to look at context rather than code concentrating initiatives and learned from them."</seg>

<seg id="1341">A wedding ring in the sand.</seg>

<seg id="1343">The childrens' marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"on 9 June 2017, the parliament of the country unanimously approved a law that should prohibit this practice, so that the age-old age is now 18."</seg>
<seg id="1345">"before this change of the marriage, some members held Hindu and Muslim religious communities in practice, and in May 2016 there came to a large public outcry. at that time, Brother Harrypersad Maharaj, the leader of the various religious groups of the country, said that the state should not interfere, as that age does not determine maturity."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tobago became a contract partner of the UN child rights convention, the minors as" "every man under the age of 18". ""</seg>
<seg id="1347">"statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the share of children who had been married to 15 in Trinidad and Tobago amounted to 2.8 percent, and with 18 it was 8.1 percent."</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in 2011, the statistical central office of the country confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married to 19 in 1997-2007."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"online petitions and social media movements, aimed at abolishing laws for children's toe, followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. undoubtedly, they helped to bring this result."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"nevertheless, everything went smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="1351">"a Hindu leader, for example, had no hesitation to say to the critics of the children's marriage, they should, to take care of their own affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1352">"this kind of religious opposition led to tensions in this actually uncomplicated matter, and at some point doubts expressed whether the opposition would even agree to the draft bill."</seg>
<seg id="1353">"but at the beginning of 2017 the bill was approved against the children's marriage - despite 4 Senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent one who abstained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him the law."</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the president of the country has to approve and declare the law.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the Senators of the country gave a status update on Facebook which again posted Leslie-Ann Boiselle on Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">"Mr. Senator Clarence Rambresat: the bill against the children's marriage was voted in the House of Representatives, with 35 votes for this and no one against it."</seg>
<seg id="1357">"after it was previously decided in the Senate, the draft can now become a law."</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of the social media users were thrilled because the laws for children were finally changed.</seg>
<seg id="1359">"member of Facebook, Lovell Francis, who is a minister of ministry in the Ministry of Education, said:"</seg>
<seg id="1360">"it took too much time and unnecessary talk that disguised the core of the matter, but do you know what? the children's toe is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and that is worth almost any price."</seg>

<seg id="1365">"Mutota, belonging to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was, noted:"</seg>
<seg id="1366">The age of old in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of the religious affiliation 18 years.</seg>
<seg id="1367">"the draft for the amendment of the marriage network was approved today, June 9, 2017."</seg>

<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series resist the blockade.</seg>
<seg id="1396">"although many technically experienced Internet users are used to using bypass tools for blocked websites (a current article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world), most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"although Turkey has been blocking Wikipedia articles since 2008, as was recently described in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockages of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Act (no. 5651) was adopted."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"after China, Turkey is the second most known country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1399">"while the platform continues to be blocked, there are now several mirrors (pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and often updated)."</seg>
<seg id="1400">"a solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), as the platform put all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized Peer-to-peer network (i.e. computer calculator connections), which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult."</seg>

<seg id="1402">"in a blog post, IPFS reports about his efforts:"</seg>
<seg id="1403">"after listening to the news (about the blocking of Wikipedia), we put everything in place to take snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, it is possible to read the contents in a distributed and distributed way."</seg>
<seg id="1404">"this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia contents, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org themselves."</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also announced that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia-Foundation and it is merely screenshots and not live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>

<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">"Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurry with poorly positioned motifs, and washed colours."</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to carry a camera with him and try to straighten the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">"today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Neptune to the international scene."</seg>
<seg id="1421">"and his hometown next to the Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Neptune wildlife."</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first-class situation in his work helps him:</seg>
<seg id="1423">"I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!"</seg>
<seg id="1424">"I just rested at home when Navaraj suddenly called me (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida Lodge). he had received a call from my father that on the shore of the Rapti River, a leopard would be."</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in just a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the leopard was located and I immediately started to kneel pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar strives to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">"and he should know [it], for he was standing up to tigers face to face:"</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can not disturb himself from the opinion of the sheep while sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleep time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">"also I was home because of the darkness on the way home, when the King of the Buk suddenly appeared. he immediately sat down, we see ourselves and he stares me through the scarf-trees!!"</seg>
<seg id="1434">"in order to promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar placed the logo" I click for conservation "(lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos."</seg>
<seg id="1435">"his passion for promoting Neptune's nature and wildlife is, however, not always easy."</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days and lived mostly in a tent to take photographs of Ottern in Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodation.</seg>

<seg id="1469">"this entry was written by Kayonaaz Kalyst and was originally published on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organization from India."</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was once again published as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">"in many parts of India women avoid speaking with the greatest care, the names of their husbands or even older men in the family."</seg>
<seg id="1472">"instead, they use a pronoun or" father of my child. ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">"from Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh women admit that due to social pressure they should respect the husband, as well as the fear of the consequences, they should disregard the norm, this practice in life."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"last year, Malati Mahatoto from the Indian State of Odisha was convicted by a false court and violated by her family and the village community, after she had addressed a married relative with names."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"the tradition of naming their wives is also common among men. however, they have far fewer privileges to fear, if any, they should not follow this practice."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"in the small village of Walhe in the Pune district, in Maharashtra, nine women, among them health personnel, and housewives, performed a unique club, thus quickly became the main theme of the city."</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone where they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">"as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, he is part of the # KhelBadal campaign, which is run by the community of Video Volunteers and is committed to the dismantling of the patriarchy."</seg>
<seg id="1479">"for seven years, Rohini Pawas has been working with the help of her video camera to expose practices such as children's marriage to the exile of HIV- and AIDS-infected, and leads these clubs."</seg>
<seg id="1480">It tells how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the first video that Rohini showed in her discussion, acted by women who did not name her husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem with which the women could easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"not to pronounce the name of their husbands loudly, it is a custom which they all committed duly and never questioned."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not hold this is considered as deceitful as a woman without morals.</seg>
<seg id="1487">Tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about it until this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning, Rohini, who had never named her husband by the name, wanted to try at home, as it runs."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini told:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him by now on his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">"with this self-confidence in the luggage, Rohini started their first discussion."</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" patriarchy "before. some believed it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"at the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the video projection, the women tried to get the discussion going."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then she all asked," "If we can't tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us as they want, it means that they do not respect us?"</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equal? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the names of their husbands to their lips," says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra on the breaking of a centuries-old tradition in which married women could never pronounce the name of their husbands. "</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini told:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she was just chick during the whole exercise; another decided to release the whole devoted frustration against him and his family by cursed him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"still in the rush of adrenaline about having broken with an old custom, the women decided that they would actually try at home to name their husbands by their name."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">"in the coming days, Rohini received a large number of reports."</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put into her head: his wife couldn't stop telling his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"when her mother-in-law stared her, she was afraid and said it was a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"another woman said," "Rohini told me to do it." ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation started violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reports how women tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the zinnoberred dot on the forehead that shows the marital status:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would wear the zinnoberred dot if he did it too.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He only laughed and I stopped wearing him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women have not completely ceased, but they think they are now in a better position to choose themselves, not to wear it in some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">"for many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals."</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "we make a trip at each point of the discussion."</seg>
<seg id="1520">"normally, we pack up lunch and water and go out to the field."</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want women to worry about who could hear what", "she says."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"in the past few months, they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes for the first time in their lives; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought of before."</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things, for example how our identities are attached to our husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to be able to say certain things, no matter how small they occur."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"in a discussion round, we talked about the concept of honour and how it is connected to clothing."</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only borne saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most people it's okay, but some wanted a Salman-Kurta to wear a wide shirt over a pair of trousers; they didn't dare."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after much debate and discussion about the merits of their own choice of clothes, morality associated with saris and much more, Rohini ornamented their own pair of Kurtas (upper shirts) in a round of discussions so that women could wear them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next they decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will do it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">"on the question of whether the five months have already changed a little since their first discussion, Rohini confirms that things are slowly rolling:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have only made small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tried it a few times, but then stopped telling the name of her husband."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including me, do it yet, but only when they are alone and no other family members are there."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the names of their husbands; only one or two women are now wearing zinc red on their foreheads at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the haggling for more freedom of movement or the choice of clothes - lie at the end of a hard to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explained:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each one of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when each woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the Video Volunteers community come from marginalized groups in India and make videos about stories that are not reported.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"these stories are" messages of those who experience themselves, "and offer a hyperlocal context to report on global human rights and development challenges."</seg>

<seg id="1585">"a new system of kidnapping of bald persons for the organ trade, probably for disbelieving purposes, worried the police of ZambÃ©zia, a province in Mozambique. the local government now called a series of operations to stop the practice."</seg>
<seg id="1586">"at the beginning of the month, three men were killed in the district of Millier, a few kilometres from the border to Malawi."</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was beheaded and part of the organs were taken from.</seg>

<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissidents Liu Xiaobo attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized due to liver cancer during the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">"in 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for" Subversion, "following the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto calling for democratic reforms in China."</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Lius case as an" "internal affair" "and a spokesman says he did not consider it" "not necessary to discuss this affair with any other country." ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">"nevertheless, China continues to receive calls from the international community, the Nobel Prize winner and his wife, poet Liu Xia, to release or allow him a treatment abroad."</seg>
<seg id="1634">"while some countries have criticised the strict treatment of the pair in Beijing, others have completely wiped out the issue."</seg>

<seg id="1637">"time Ra-ad al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu."</seg>
<seg id="1638">"however, a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure in order to allow Liu abroad to be treated."</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway and Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister BÃ¸rge Brende refused to answer questions about his release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">"the relationship between China and Norway came to a halt after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision."</seg>
<seg id="1642">"diplomatic relations continued until December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon exports to China, as the exports had largely been blocked since 2010."</seg>
<seg id="1643">"after the news had spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo."</seg>
<seg id="1644">"due to his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his prize."</seg>
<seg id="1645">"during the ceremony, Liu was represented by an empty chair."</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">"on 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to release Liu and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance where he wants."</seg>
<seg id="1648">"the top diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called for the release of Lius, as announced in a statement on 30 June:"</seg>

<seg id="1654">"the US embassy requests a furious response from China, with the Foreign Ministry's statement that" "no country has the right to interfere and make irresponsible comments about Chinese internal affairs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley announced that China should offer the couple the following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">"protection and freedom, such as travel freedom and access to the medical care of his choice, to which they claim according to the Chinese constitution and legal system and international obligations."</seg>

<seg id="1676">"the spiritual guide in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, was very concerned about Liu in an explanation on 28 June at Liu and admitted that many asked him to pray for Lius well-being."</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">"it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious, more stable and prosperous China, which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world."</seg>
<seg id="1679">"I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, the Charter 08, which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China."</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">"the question may seem foolish, as Singapore is recognised as an independent state at an international level."</seg>
<seg id="1685">"but according to the Minister of Justice, K. Shanmuz, Singapore should be considered a city."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has sparked a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the State of New York, the Minister remarked that many people criticized the dominance of Singapore's only political party because it compared Singapore to other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supports that Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">"that's it, most people make a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"the blog of Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice," "turning the logic" "in order to defend the authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land, one hears that we are ultimately not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, whose land is it?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons cited by Shanaggam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in the face of that, it inevitably appeared undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"on the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities like Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently guided by a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"as soon as one reaches the core of the subject, the good old corpse emerges from the authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, leaving the twisted logic, as it is better suited to their power."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"in the end, the last week of Shanmuz gave answers to his American guests about our press, our judicial system, our political system really non-responses."</seg>
<seg id="1703">He disguised the corresponding questions with non-answers in a rational way.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls on Shanmuff to clear his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"when Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to which country belongs our city..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"in short, I don't understand anything."</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmuck would take the trouble to clarify this point if he was paid highly to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">"by publishing his comments on the blog, he points out the critics about the fact that one should start reading the entire transcript of the conference so that one could better understand the context of the statements of Shanmugam, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"when he said that Singapore was more a" city "than a country," he explained why the Singapore elections were so unimportant even if we enjoy free and fair elections. "</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore to cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"when he said Singapore," Be not a country, "he obviously did not mean it in this sense!"</seg>
<seg id="1714">"Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmuff, who as leader of a growing generation, makes such a polemic statement."</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said...</seg>
<seg id="1716">"at least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard, what I expect - whether I agree with them or not, but that's another thing."</seg>
<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanmuck, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes it is really associated and aware of what he defends."</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review disintegrates the weak points of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"did Mr. Shanmuz celebrate" "good faith" "or was it a Freudian slip?"</seg>
<seg id="1720">"when Singapore is not a country, we are regarded only as an independent and sovereign state?"</seg>
<seg id="1721">"if not, what country do the sovereign rights of Singapore go back?"</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique; it is equally country and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">"since he plays an important role within the government cabinet, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of grave importance."</seg>
<seg id="1724">"why do the people of Singapore afford their military service, but do they only defend their city but not their country?"</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must repay our prime minister invoices?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink ID card?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">"the magazine Journey of a Decade tends to Bejahung, Singapore, and was always a city:"</seg>
<seg id="1729">I didn't say what I said...</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have annoyed many people of Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We were always a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"I can understand that we often hear statements like" the defense of the country especially "etc., but that is not quite right."</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should rather speak of the defense of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1744">"depending on the situation in which the conversation takes place, it is considered polite to show interest in his conversation partner by asking personal questions."</seg>
<seg id="1745">"my clarification mostly follows the standard answer:" Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature. "many Canadians perhaps cook with anger inwardly when they are held for Americans, but I don't disturb me."</seg>
<seg id="1746">"for someone who doesn't know, there is little that distinguishes us Canadians from Americans."</seg>

<seg id="1789">"the" 44 rules of the girls "possibly relate to the draconic section 44 of the provisional constitution, which gives the supreme commander of the army an absolute decision making over important national issues."</seg>

<seg id="1897">This article by Amy Bracken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI.org and is published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="1898">"on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality."</seg>
<seg id="1899">"I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tapachula, it is located at the border to Guatemala."</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">"it is led by a 59-year-old Mexican woman, a little woman with a coral-pink brillard frame and gold-coloured earrings in a teddy bear shape."</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a target for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for about $2.50 the night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - but hundreds of African and Haitian migrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, Mrs RamÃ­rez narrates, the people come to full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to cry:" "mother Africa!"</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you from Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">"currently it is rather quiet, but this year, RamÃ­rez has already received 200 guests at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"there are only 24 rooms, some have already slept on cardboard outside."</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to refuse anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">"she also helps them and brings her to the hospital when she is sick, she buys medication that they can't pay, she massaging them with a balm that exhausted from the long journey."</seg>
<seg id="1914">"Tychque Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived a short time ago."</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa was a reasonable nickname for Mrs. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">"the Sebastiao family (with her daughter Merrui, who has a Yoghurtbart) posing with ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez."</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," he answers with a smile. "I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women."</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"they have lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had heard from other companions of Mom Africa." Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track, "says Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti."</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that Haitians and Africans often travel together and that Africans are already speaking about Whatsapp from Mrs. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">"like many of his companions, Michelet has lived in Brazil and worked as a construction worker on construction sites for the Olympic Games and the World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"when the Brazilian economy was weaker, he began his journey to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mom Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will contact Mrs. RamÃ­rez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"mother Africa is our mother and we never let her go again," he answers smiling. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. RamÃ­rez tells her guests often send her messages when she went to greet her or to report her about the course of her journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She declares that her Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"she doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to cook chicken as in Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"Mrs. RamÃ­rez may be well known here, but she is not the only spark hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"at the other end of the city, a dead end leads to JesÃºs Valenzuela."</seg>
<seg id="1937">Valenzuela and his family have included migrants in their small house this winter.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">"he has begun to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his home for one dollar the night offered."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"at the moment, 25 people are there, mainly Haitians."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking station outside."</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela declares that he knows what guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," he says. "I have experienced what they experience."</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people can help and others do not help. that's why I give them my support.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"after having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants travelling through Tapachula comes from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them."</seg>
<seg id="1948">JosÃ© Antonio Cordova MelÃ©ndez tells me he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children from people who wanted to blackmail money without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"in Tapachula, he asked for accommodation and an unknown person, a single person, offered him a shelter."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"a few months later, the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next step is to go."</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests again.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"in the corridors, travelers quietly consult their telephones."</seg>
<seg id="1953">"a minibus has arrived today and brought 20 new guests, most of them from Somalia."</seg>
<seg id="1954">"Mrs. RamÃ­rez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who have gone away."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"like a proud grandmother, she leaves with numerous photos in her album."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"there is one of her daughter with African hair spots, which you made a client, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old."</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sadly as she presents her briefly.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya se fueron," she repeated every time. "they have gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang inhabitants are forced to install a monitoring app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">"a check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang by Twitter users,"</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones."</seg>
<seg id="1962">"on July 10, the mobile users in the Tianshan district of the city of Urumqi received a mobile phone notification in which it instructs the district government to install a monitoring app called Jingwang (or" "Web Cleaning" ")."</seg>
<seg id="1963">"in the message, it is said that the app will prevent access to terrorist information."</seg>
<seg id="1964">"however, the authorities could also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="1965">"according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture, because they, shortly after they had installed the app, had exchanged messages with a private chat group."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"the communication of the police states that the app would detect and prosecute the sources and distribution channels of terrorists, along with" illegal religious "activities and" harmful information, "including videos, pictures, eBooks and documents."</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">"Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom."</seg>
<seg id="1969">"the main function is blocking pornographic websites, from online fraud, trojans and phishing pages to alert users how much time they spend online, and to remotely control their home network."</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filtering for minors should help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">"for example, the" remote control "could empower state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal a person's home network."</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">"while news about digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often gloomy for those who live in remote, crowded ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"in order to limit unrest and discontent in conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme tenures and surveillance measures as well as routine internet shutdowns."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"the media outlet" Images from mainland China "(such as" "Images from mainland China" "), which published censored news in China, showed photographs of a checkpoint where policemen assaulted residents indiscriminately whether they had installed the Surveillance App."</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">"if you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, they may be imprisoned for up to 10 days."</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">You have forced people to use devices that are meant for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by the overgrowth technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"" "images from mainland China" "(as such) also published a Jingwang product description from which the software can lift the password requirements of a Windows operating system and thus receive unrestricted access to the computer's hard drive."</seg>
<seg id="1985">"after installing Jingwang, computer and mobile phones in Xinjiang will become electronic handcuffs."</seg>
<seg id="1986">The regulations in Jingwang may be a reaction to the Council's instructions to minimise the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">"all branches, authorities and the party affiliated with the party, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office during the operation of their computers and communication devices."</seg>
<seg id="1988">"an up-to-date Freedom House report, an American human rights organization, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:"</seg>
<seg id="1989">"in Xinjiang, on June 27, in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi, the authorities issued a regulation with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs until 1 August to register their" personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media memory cards "at the local police."</seg>
<seg id="1990">"the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any" terrorist "videos. however, this action violates the personal rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a number of other possible offences, including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages."</seg>

<seg id="2006">"for the first time, it was quiet, motionless, at the wrong time, even though I didn't put any high demands on a city that is up to the arteries with state security organisms and their accomplices."</seg>
<seg id="2007">"in the third night things had a little calmed down, after the power supply stopped working in the neighborhood."</seg>
<seg id="2008">I interrupted the silence by screaming "Allahu Akbar" several times from my house roof.</seg>

<seg id="2015">He put on.</seg>
<seg id="2016">"then I learned the following: no matter how much honey you can swallow, nothing can give you back your voice after you screamed it all the way to the office of security service from the body."</seg>

<seg id="2024">"perhaps it was due to my folly, vanity; perhaps in the revolution."</seg>
<seg id="2025">I was so sure of my cause when I answered: "I wouldn't have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"and I think I've never stopped looking into your eyes, so why should I do it now?"</seg>
<seg id="2027">"it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me, and yet I don't regret any word from what I said."</seg>

<seg id="2039">"I learned that my cell-mate was a" "first prisoner". ""</seg>
<seg id="2040">After a long hesitation he finally answered me.</seg>

<seg id="2054">They are here to be heard.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"thus the secret was lifted: to protect the security against us and prevent us from releasing the traitor and the terrorists in us, they speak in the alawitic dialect - so they played their denominational blackmail and betrayed the narrow vision of their world view."</seg>

<seg id="2058">"he starts a" pleasant "conversation, despite the facial expressions that will derail him:" my boy, you are still young, you can start so much more important with your life as you join this diary and protest against demonstrations that will soon come to an end. "</seg>
<seg id="2059">I did not answer.</seg>
<seg id="2060">I got used to it not to answer.</seg>
<seg id="2061">I can't say exactly when insults and blows after a friendly conversation have become a common means of communication for me.</seg>
<seg id="2062">When and how this happened was unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">"some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished, even though I didn't do anything to earn this punishment."</seg>

<seg id="2070">"my screams were not enough for him yet, which is why they exchanged the pipe through a cable."</seg>
<seg id="2071">"at my first arrest, I asked myself whether the investigator had worked as a garbage collector before or whether it belonged to the normal work equipment."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"they had four cables intertwined to present us, from their point of view, great invention of a huge cable."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"within a single hour three of them changed, while I was still in the series."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice, which is why I listened to screaming."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"the executioner remarked the cooling and didn't take any pleasure in doing so, which is why he was next to an electrically loaded rod."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"electricity flowed all my body, enough to store my whole neighborhood."</seg>
<seg id="2077">My half-naked body lying on the ground was the perfect conductor.</seg>
<seg id="2078">The numbness disappeared and the pain was back again.</seg>
<seg id="2079">After two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">This must have been around midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">I decided to sleep again; let's say that was my only option.</seg>
<seg id="2082">"some hours passed, which came to me like minutes."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then the call to the morning prayer.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"the door opens and the morning light fills the room." "Raus with you, Arschficker."</seg>
<seg id="2085">"I answer with the voice of an exhausted youth:" "my Lord, my Father must be fearful."</seg>
<seg id="2086">"be quiet and away, you will be moved."</seg>
<seg id="2087">That was new.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Otherwise they had always released me.</seg>
<seg id="2089">Where do they lead me?!</seg>
<seg id="2090">"the Jordanian Rapper Emslam Hdaib talks about the rights of the LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smoked a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"the photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time indoors; sometimes he shuffles to his screen, sometimes to his computer, and again to his couch."</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers or his lips stained with nicotine.</seg>
<seg id="2095">"he lives in the uppermost floor of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year in which Israel completed its occupation of the West Bank and forced Hdaibs family to flee their village in Palestine, in which they lived as feluyees (about: farmers)."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"for six years, Hdaib has been a passionate activist who confronts the conservative majority and questioned her well-established opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rape."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"with his music, which often deals with topics such as orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"with his 25 years, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not limited by limitations in his mind, and he can sympathise with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if he does not admit it openly, he has a special reluctance against American foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib looks at his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones, has something to do with his identity as a" Palestinian prisoner of the second generation, "he calls himself even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think of my own circumstances so," Hdaib emphasizes. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" I think so, because I am a human, "while he pours in water dissolved NescafÃ© in two cups. it is the holy month Ramadan; in this time, it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset."</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a very hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">"basically, the smelling of tepid coffee and the wades of the Kent cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air, especially if you take a look at the neighbouring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan to drink water - in order not to land in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, the interior department of Jordan has cancelled a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual front singer Hamed Sinno contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country, and the main reason for the concert."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"the MP and former spokesman of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert" "just" "had been cancelled because of sexual orientation of the singer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many also argue that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which poses the tried-and-tested legitimacy of authoritarian regimes across the region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila estimated the Jordanian people as" progressive supporters of human rights, "who continue to choose" intellectual and cultural pluralism. ""</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement should probably not be simply shallow rhetoric, but actually reflect a more and more clearly crystallized reality in Jordan, which clearly appears in Hdaibs's work."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016, Hdaib returned traditional lineage to Leibe by completing his vision of the fate of Arab women who have marital sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the picture shows the skeleton of a woman whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas, revealing the skeleton of a clearly trampled woman whose arms and legs stretch towards the corners of the canvas."</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should actually trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">"in recent years, the number of 'volunteers' has increased in Jordan - the unofficial outside."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"according to Human Rights Watch, the number of volunteers in 2016 reached its peak; however, it is still appalling that Jordan is lacking the institutional infrastructure to support the women who have attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law on the crime of crime from 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can" "be held in prison for an indefinite period of time", "and for their release it is often necessary to have years of bureaucratic expenditure and the guarantee by the family that the woman has nothing to do."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"also, Hdaibs's music enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from issues that have long been taboo in his country."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib denies that his work is political, but he admits that he cannot separate his music, which is full of explicit references to sexuality, freedom and expression."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"politics was caught in me," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="2126">"in a song called" Edward Sa'ed, "Hdaib tackles the question of Palestinian identity."</seg>
<seg id="2127">"in" Lawla al 3aib "and" Ghareeb, "the focus is on poverty."</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political in essence can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">"in March 2016, Hdaib released a song titled" Santandano. ""</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated strikingly often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a sort of market on which you can" "get what you want" "- be it faith or non-belief, heterogeneity or homosexuality."</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that hardly anyone in Jordan speaks about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals have been censored up until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya, in order to note that his comments were torn out of context, distorted and his opinion had been censored."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but streamed was only a edited version," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today, Hdaib is campaigning for the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance to homosexuals is not about Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentions Abu Nueva, a poet of the eighth century, who still remains in memory thanks to his homoerotic poetry."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nueva, who was supposed to work on behalf of the caliph, could openly write about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians do that?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the hashemic realm, it is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service stated several former members of the government and members of the Teaching Federation, with the reason that they have critically expressed themselves in social media comments related to the problems rooted in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of this, Hdaibs's opinion is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to create a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"Jordan has denied Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - so it sees Hdaib - consists of slow, thoughtful and internal changes."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"in the end, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to" experience it. ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region is approached by music, art and literature of genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, spreading unitions and in artificial ways democracies. at least he hopes."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until the time comes, Hdaib will continue to rap and therefore also offer resistance."</seg>

<seg id="2150">These great and extravagant martial dolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it is assumed that there is a variation of the Tanabata festival, which is usually celebrated in many areas of Tohokus in August. another theory states that the vans, drums and dancing were marched over more than a thousand years, to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the emisshi, to their knees."</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"we could grab some great seats, so we have a great view."</seg>
<seg id="2155">It is hard to imagine how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">"a community centre in the capital city, Meguro Gajoen, hosted a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literally."</seg>
<seg id="2157">I've been looking at the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two fixed cars are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">"nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true - and still a stunning way to spend his summer:"</seg>

<seg id="2167">"outer appearance and body care were rarely as important as in this story, because they help to keep the Peruvian youth away from crime and to promote a legitimate profession like that of the hairdresser."</seg>
<seg id="2168">"El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of Lima, a region with a very high crime rate, where street robbery and illegal drug trafficking are everyday."</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region would not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">"at the same time, Peru, like many other Central and South American countries, is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men."</seg>
<seg id="2171">"to copy the trend, appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous athletes such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to getting more and more regular citizens into the experienced hands of hairdressers who can recreate these intricate hairstyles."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the unparalleled demand for hairstyles, which go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of hairdressers" Batalla de Barberos, "which has been held since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2173">"experts compete against each other in order to show who can create the most eccentric looks of them, as can be seen in the following video (more videos on current competitions are available on the public facebook profile Batalla de Barberos)."</seg>
<seg id="2174">"educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found an opportunity to persuade young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and instead of poor advice to get training in the art of hairdressing which allows them to find work."</seg>
<seg id="2175">"motivated by this activity and opportunities, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion."</seg>
<seg id="2176">"before the school year beginning in March, the school offered special training workshops and reported some of their successes:"</seg>

<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letters to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the edited version of the contribution "Love messages to guerrilla fighters" published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not even more important, people who feel expelled, to accommodate affection?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">"this is exactly what prompted the young Colombian activist Leonardo PÃ¡rraga from the foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation and inspired her to the campaign Cartas por la AliaciÃ³n (letters for reconciliation), encouraging young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"only recently, their country was the scene of a historic event, and they wanted to contribute to it: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government signed a peace agreement with the guerrilla occupation FARC (German: revolutionary forces of Colombia), which forms the conclusion of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"internationally, the signing of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colombian president JosÃ© Manuel Santos won the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"however, before the Colombians there is a long way to speak of a real reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"guerrilla fighters who lived in illegal camps for many years, exposed to war rhetoric and carrying their weapons around the clock, must now integrate themselves into life as civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society, once more used to life in constant fear and in some cases, has gotten used to deep hatred towards guerrilla fighters, must now take it into its ranks and support it in building a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian convinced that the young Colombians should join together and help in the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">"and that's exactly what they did: up to now, thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back in society."</seg>
<seg id="2193">"the aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for each former guerilla fighter, who will then be delivered personally."</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for the Letters to Reconciliation was born on the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in BogotÃ¡ in February 2017. there Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to speak with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"this explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valentine's Day, but those who need it much more unnecessary."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he planed, told him to share his love with people this year, who needed the most pressing response."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, who now have to find their place in society and build up a new life." "the letters will show that Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war story to a common history of peace." ""</seg>
<seg id="2199">"until now, more than 2,000 letters have been collected during the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities in Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡."</seg>
<seg id="2201">I never thought that someone would forgive me</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the region of Caldono-Cauca on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the municipality of Cali and Leonardo from the BogotArt Foundation, travelled to the camp to personally transfer the letters."</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC set themselves up as they had done earlier to accept the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they did not receive orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between," "told Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later."</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, an employee of the Governor of the Province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after passing the letters, a former warrior led me through the camp of guerilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" Cameras "(a kind of hut where the guerrilla fighters lived) I saw a guerrilla fighter, who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go down, because next to him on the bed there was a MGL pomegranate, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"and I said to him," "Hello, what are they doing?" "he said," "I answer a letter that someone wrote to me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never in my life somebody has written something so beautiful, so I answer it." then suddenly my tears ran over the cheeks. "</seg>
<seg id="2214">"I hugged him firmly, and sat down beside the pomegranates."</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was sorry for the war, it was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he never expected anything else from life than war. to join the FARC, was the only way to save him and his six brothers from starvation." I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes. "</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know there is a society outside that awaits us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">"so far, I only learned how to deal with weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"at the start of the year, students and some of the FARC leaders came together for a discussion."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC was already active in the secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"for this reason, the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organisation, its ideals and gave an insight into their views on the peace process:" for many years we have experienced how social injustice promoted by the state to the entire Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop a political party, we can help shape society in this country more just. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"the goal of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles," one of them said. "</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"hearing those people who had never heard a hearing and had no right to vote, and recognizing that the people I often saw as a monster and hated even hate, were only people with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their living conditions and their environment, was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the land lives is hurting me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforts me that all people - even those who have killed and caused so much damage, can teach us something and give a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote the following letter, for example DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monsalve, Archbishop of the town of Cali:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">The columbianist was prophesied that after disarming would reign peace.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people willing to grab weapons, collect and protest for their rights, and this is also completely justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we of the FARC now put on peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"this is why we call all the defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, for we know from our own experience that nothing is easy. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will be faced with many difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"there will be many obstacles on our way, but together we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2243">"gay and queer people living in the Caucasus region are exposed to a wide range of dangers, including discrimination, physical and sexual violence and blackmail."</seg>
<seg id="2244">"with terror, activists have witnessed the reporting of recent months over the persecution of gay men in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2245">But the threat that hangs over the LGBTQ community about the LGBTQ community has not been created overnight.</seg>
<seg id="2246">"OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a transsexual woman from Grozny, who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is happening in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2247">"several months ago, the LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya has captured the international headlines after reports published that deal with the spread, torture and killing of queer men in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in the Nowaya Gazeta; she threw a light on the methods of the Chechen authorities who arrested suspicious queer men and put them into secret prisons in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"you have brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">"Sabrina, a Translator, was born in Grozny and grew up there."</seg>
<seg id="2251">"since her childhood, she felt that she was a woman in reality."</seg>
<seg id="2252">"when she grew up, she became aware that Chechnya was no safe place for her, which is why she moved to Moscow."</seg>
<seg id="2253">"after experiencing a group of Chechens from the gender balance of their countrywoman, the hunt was opened on Sabrina."</seg>
<seg id="2254">"from fear of her life, she eventually moved to the USA."</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I was working as a volunteer for a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I told me that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"it was a friend of Dagestan, a woman who was in trouble."</seg>
<seg id="2258">"she had no money, so I took her without hesitation."</seg>
<seg id="2259">"as I tried to help her, someone from whom I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread it anywhere on the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me."</seg>
<seg id="2260">"after that, the photos of my documents made the round through WhatsApp."</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015 I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">"when I was watching a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a male voice saying," "Here is a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">"when I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I hurt nothing."</seg>
<seg id="2264">"then I heard a sentence, but this time in Chechnya:" how long do you want to dishonour the family, you stain? "</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">"I just know that it was a young man, not 30 years old."</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up again in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">"apparently, some women had all got along and started crying."</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man had fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">"in the hospital, I learned that I had two stitches in my right lung."</seg>
<seg id="2272">"OC Media: in what kind of nurses were you laid, in which of the men or women?"</seg>
<seg id="2273">"Sabrina: my documents are outdated because my male name stands on it, but the doctor understood and put me to the women."</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful to him for this.</seg>
<seg id="2275">"when I read his name for the first time at his office door, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name."</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for being respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I received threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">"they called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown."</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">"they demanded to send me back to Chechnya, to prove that it was all a lie."</seg>
<seg id="2284">"they made absurd demands: some said to me, I must prove it by running through the streets above without going through the streets; others wanted me to appear in the official television in Grosny saying that I had not changed my sex, that everything was just bad speech and Photoshop."</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what would I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still difficult for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once talked to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"they said to her," "You have brought a monster to the world that has not only corrupted your family, but the whole republic."</seg>
<seg id="2290">"we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here."</seg>
<seg id="2291">"my mother became too much, and she lay a snare around her neck."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"luckily, the neighbours came and saved them."</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with darkened windows and a number plate with a 95 on the window.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"after it happened for the third time, it became clear to me that there was something rotten."</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for security reasons I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with their help I left the country, but then something incredible happened."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before I left Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought it without registering, without identification, without anything."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"at the moment when I wanted to call my mother via WhatsApp, I got a message:" "you don't believe, you'd be security just because you left the country?"</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people know at which hotel you are stuck. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove it to you: it is the number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine this?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, we don't talk about gender equality, that's a taboo topic."</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still carry some traditional Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"as much as I wish, I can't overcome this spiritual barrier."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chatted with camera, I really try to look like the person they remember from their past - so to my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what do your friends, those who have stayed there?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: last week I submitted a report to Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">"for him, I needed up-to-date information on the situation in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2325">I spoke to someone who was in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that during Ramadan there were no people arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait and he did not shut up a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"I mean, they probably invite the relatives who take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end demand a proof that the so-called" "honour" "has experienced satisfaction with blood."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are gay men still held in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: an acquaintance of me says that there are not many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, then, especially those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives in order to put themselves in judgment."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they are held there so that they can be presented as terrorists later."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say," "Should they be killed, they will show their bodies on TV, claiming they have attacked any village or military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people were not simply gone, but specifically submerged in order to radicalise themselves."</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is that only a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard grew.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new from them since then.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They just took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so-called Lord, that person was there even when these people were taken along."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"until now, however, they were not presented as bandits, but there were no reports so far. however, we suspect that such actions are quite possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would you not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people belonging to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already taken place in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">"I think that before 2003 I was already known in quite big, when I was still living there - and I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2348">In earnest!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999, when the sharia was applied, I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia originally wanted to bring us to the" "civilisation", "but finally thrown us back to the Stone Age."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">"Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had colored eyelashes, wore tubular jeans and short tops."</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Safety of Sharia has never injured my hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"before the Russian theater in Grosny, there was a place where every night, especially on weekends, a whole group of people as I met."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several benches were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"in the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is," Don't talk about the misfortune of another. ""</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to be children when they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so they just closed their eyes shut, because they thought you were sick?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">"they never insulted me, never hunted and never beaten."</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace period last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow stepped on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to talk about morality on television."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he did not talk about us per se, but primarily about the behaviour of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">"nevertheless, it was possible to feel how people began to change in the city."</seg>
<seg id="2368">"who had smiled and laughed before, looked at you at once with suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="2369">"in time, I left Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came back home, I could feel the situation in the Republic steadily deteriorated."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: which activity do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I do not earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"apart from that, I am still active as an activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">"currently, I am responsible for 15 Muslim women."</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we organize teacrew, meetings, I escort them to the hospital and help them get food maps."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't have a cent for it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I clapped shelter.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's great.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"so nature, that has nothing to do with religion."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"this is exactly the same as Chechens, who want to prophesy with froth in front of the mouth that there are no gays with them."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the Dagestanes, who have the Cabardines who, the Russians, also have which; on the whole planet they exist - but" not in Chechnya. ""</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I come from there, so it's unpleasant for me to hear something like that."</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus here.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">"you know, many think of transient to men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different kinds of sensation to be exact, different attitudes of life."</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel myself in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"sorry that I'm going to be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago."</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not very sad at all - I just know that I am now myself.</seg>

<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahraz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"since the last few months, there has been a strong increase in suicide."</seg>

<seg id="2400">"the self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi on 27 August reversed the desperate situation of the Arab Ahrazi community in Iran, which is marked by poverty and unemployment, into the spotlight."</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in Ahraz region in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"he suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability to pay for his family, so Ahrazi and human rights groups who want to work in Ahraz and remain anonymous."</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube kept the moments after he had kindled himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">"some people quickly manage to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was taken to the Taleghani hospital in Ahraz."</seg>
<seg id="2405">"according to local sources, the burns were so strong that the doctors could not do anything any more."</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2407">"it was not the only suicide assassinated in the Arab Ahrazi-minority in August, and activists on the spot warn that more men could take their lives."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"the Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Hamid Manifestat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - hanged."</seg>
<seg id="2409">"their stories have one thing in common: they were all family fathers, who felt helpless and unable to feed their families and pursue a safe work."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"Arab Ahrazi are suffering from poverty, unemployment and discrimination"</seg>
<seg id="2411">"the region, located in which a large part of the Arab Ahrazi community living in Iran, was shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it hard for the local Arab population to deny its livelihood."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"a century ago, the Arab Ahraz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy assumed power and made a great effort in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"in the Ahraz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population receives little from this wealth."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"it is often victims of untreated diseases, hunger and deprivation."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Iranian regime has refused the Ahrazi Arabs to systematically create jobs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries."</seg>
<seg id="2417">"the government has also built a large number of dams to divert the water from the Arab territories into the Persian areas, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are located."</seg>
<seg id="2418">"these dams have only led to aggravating the devastation caused by dryness, and destroying local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry."</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab ahawk youngsters increased to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">"Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian general director of cooperatives, work and social welfare, reported that 5% of the Ahrazis who are looking for a job, completed 55% of secondary school, and 45% have a university degree."</seg>

<seg id="2422">"Karim Dohimi, an Iranian ancestor human rights activist with resident in London, told Global Voices that the present situation, a mixture of" poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination, "leads to a" high rise "in the number of suicide among young Ahrazi."</seg>
<seg id="2423">"for this reason, a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians and anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians and anti-Arab discrimination:"</seg>
<seg id="2424">"since functionaries and institutions do not prefer Arab workers, the local Arab Ahrazi is deprived of access to work opportunities in all sectors."</seg>
<seg id="2425">"this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime, which aims to destroy the spirit of the national resistance of young Arabs and to force them to earn their livelihood outside their native Ahraz."</seg>
<seg id="2426">"there are people who had to change their first and last name in order to hide their affiliation to the Ahrazi and to be hired, as even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated, let alone speaking the Arabic language or wearing Arab clothing."</seg>
<seg id="2427">"given the circumstances that the Arab Ahrazi has to endure, human rights activists commit alarm before the situation becomes explosive."</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world wakes up and takes notice of it.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I do not identify with feminism, even with intersectional not"</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. taken by Pixabay. released under the CC0 Creative Commons license.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the AfrofÃ©minas website. the article was subject to several discussions in which many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"when I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women - call themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">"they even lay well thought-out scientific and social arguments in front of me, why I should be a feminist and why we should generally be all feminist * inside."</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, women still earn less money in spite of the same education than men nowadays."</seg>
<seg id="2441">Women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms are still ensuring that women sooner or later stumble across a glass ceiling in various areas of life, and that discrimination on the basis of gender still attracts across the many different countries and denominations."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and well-known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I suffer double and triple among them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"yet, if I come to speak on skin colour, on racism, on black female women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I mention in what manner we have been abused physically, mentally and verbally, both in and out of the feminist movement, many white feminists decide to remain silent."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"but they all agree that women - all women - should come together to" "lift up their voices and" "Kumbaya, my Lord" "to achieve equal rights (some) of women."</seg>
<seg id="2449">"but they don't want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexualised violence, there is an institutionalized form of racial-motivated violence that we are exposed to black women in two ways."</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnic and home countries earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">"that black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to the school as white girls, due to obvious integration problems."</seg>
<seg id="2452">"or that women are exposed to a higher risk in black spheres and women with a migration background, suffer from domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women."</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand, I want all women to have the same rights for all men and all men. on the other hand, as a black woman, I cannot join a movement in whose center the white woman stands who refuses to consider injustices in her mind, which relate both to gender and the skin color of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">"I am exhausted and will not fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented sphere, which always rejected me and countless other black women."</seg>
<seg id="2455">"in 1851, Sojourner complained in her speech:" "am I not a woman?" "and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is in a historical sense a dehumanized and marginalized being."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I refuse to join groups who also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropriation, in order to advance their egocentric programme."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer attempt to close white women to the importance of overlap of skin colour and gender. for some of them continue to keep silent on the significance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to teach them for a better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different revenues a home and to distinguish themselves from white feminism, there is still the word" feminism "in its name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I prefer to release myself fully and completely from feminism and to join the movement of Womanism, which has been called into life for my dark skin and my status as a woman, rather than for a white-feminist paradigm that is so stubborn that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and enter into the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism: Reclaiming (for example: Africa-Womanisms: how we can defend ourselves) speaks of how we can defend ourselves to our own way. and not only that - black women can thus also create spaces in which they can be worshipped in the cultural, mental, spiritual, physical and even the spiritual elements that make up the black woman."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatism and marginalisation after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself of the hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement of which the black woman is affected."</seg>
<seg id="2463">"in a womanistic environment, I can lift black women and women from other cultures, as in this paradigm I exist."</seg>
<seg id="2464">"because of my dark skin and because of my existence, I am recognized as a woman as a part of this paradigm."</seg>
<seg id="2465">"I, a black woman, can bloom in an environment in which my life is neither bypassed nor ignored nor rejected."</seg>
<seg id="2466">Paddling against pollution: a man's mission to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations</seg>
<seg id="2467">"this contribution by Todd Reubold was originally published on Ensia.com, a magazine that reports in particular about international efforts to solve environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="2468">"as part of a content sharing agreement, this article will be published once again."</seg>
<seg id="2469">"in the past 7 years, Nabil Musa traveled again and again with a special concern of the Kurdistan region in Iraq. his mission is to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations."</seg>
<seg id="2470">In this documentary by Emily Kinskey we follow Musa who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church.</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I really wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child," Musa tells. "</seg>
<seg id="2472">"scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war, the construction of dams, pollution and uncontrolled development will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="2473">"Musa is a member of the NGO Waterkeepers Iraq - a subsidiary of Waterkeeper Alliance - committed to protecting the rivers, streams and waterways in Iraq and to support local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources."</seg>
<seg id="2474">"at the end of the video, Musa summarises the urgency and importance of his work in one question:" if we had no water, how would we survive? "</seg>
<seg id="2475">"this video was produced, filmed and published for Ensia von Emily Kinskey, a documentary filmmaker and multimedia journalist resident in Erbil, Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="2476">"the focus of their work is on persecuted, little noteworthy subcultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative photography and new multimedia techniques, with the help of suppressed communities to tell their stories in their own way."</seg>

<seg id="2480">"the following article is the abbreviated and edited version of the article" "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay" "by Kurtural. the article belongs to the series # PorSermujer (# ernlicheinephp), which reports on the violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been modified to protect the affected individuals.</seg>
<seg id="2482">"a police commissary said Ada BÃ¡ez, that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-partner, who had become violent against her."</seg>
<seg id="2483">"since the end of their relationship some time has passed and the police said their statement would be put to the acts, but more could not be done."</seg>
<seg id="2484">"when another woman showed Balbuena due to ill treatment, the Ada BÃ¡ez display also used nothing."</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later the second woman withdrew her ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"if women complain at all, they generally do not receive support from the State."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases, women are also financially dependent on men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women admit to be victims of violence, to report to the prosecution authorities at all."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"content 1 Strips and Statistical 2 Invisible abuse and a legal system that does not prohibit Paraguay-3 Paraguays Law: good approach, poor implementation of punches and statistics"</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is difficult to determine how many women are really mistreated, says Myrian GonzÃ¡lez, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de DocumentaciÃ³n y Estudios, a socio-scientific research institute in Paraguay." "there are various information and reports that do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay", "she explains."</seg>
<seg id="2491">"however, the figures available are alarming."</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015, the District Attorney Office launched 9600 adverts for domestic violence. at 70% of it, it was about violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">"there were more than 5,000 advertisements for domestic violence in the courts of peace. 86% of the ads of women came here as well."</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the ads, 40% of women said they were physically mistreated, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2496">"however, these statistics do not show the real extent of violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the Paraguayan women's minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually shown." "on every woman who is refunded in Paraguay for psychological abuse, 9 women who do not do this."</seg>
<seg id="2498">"on any woman who is refunded because of physical abuse, two women who do not do this," "she declared at the end of 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2499">"because women's murder is not a criminal offence in Paraguay, the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered by their current or former partners each year."</seg>
<seg id="2500">"by August 2016 alone, journalists included at least 12 cases of women's suicide in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases in which women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">"according to estimates, in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies because of violence by men."</seg>

<seg id="2505">"before Mariana BrÃ­tez became the strong friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the names of all her former friends."</seg>
<seg id="2506">"in the beginning she didn't want to do that, but after that, she had to repent."</seg>
<seg id="2507">"today, Mariana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos together. but for two years she endured mental violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult to recognize:"</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would become a victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"when I read about it earlier, I always thought that it only happened to women who are too subservient because they let themselves be deceived by violent men."</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the abuse by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">"without naming a name, she wrote contributions on Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he isolated her."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos itself. he asked rhetorically if he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2514">"other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had fallen so long by Carlos, and did not leave him earlier."</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse should at least have a certain complicity in it.</seg>
<seg id="2516">"Victoria Santos, who is not from Paraguay, fought for nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner was mistreated her."</seg>

<seg id="2529">"on 10 August 2016, a bill was discussed at the Paraguayan parliament, known as # PorEllas (# prince) under the hashtag # PorEllas."</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and motion # NiUnaMenos (# Non-Unification) are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law stipulates that femicid has to declare to an independent criminal record and to punish the hardener as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">"in this way, the text has been changed in a number of ways in order to also win the deputies of the law, which feared that the way for decriminalisation of abortions, which is currently banned in Paraguay, will be punished with up to five years imprisonment."</seg>
<seg id="2533">"the original bill foresaw the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) procedural costs, which the victims of violence must bear witness to themselves, if they simply want to refund and receive a secure accommodation to impose the state."</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argue that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">"in Paraguay, mistreatment is seen as part of interpersonal relationships."</seg>
<seg id="2536">"in this case, a rethinking must take place so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal."</seg>
<seg id="2537">"whoever is silent in the face of these facts, complicates and contributes to the fact that the perpetrators come away."</seg>
<seg id="2538">We have to report as long as abuse is no longer considered normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">"on 10 November 2016, the law was passed in the Paraguayan Senate. however, parts of the law had been modified, including a passage that the partners called in cases of domestic violence for reconciliation."</seg>

<seg id="2587">"Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, illustration takes place with his consent"</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely or even not mentioned in the media. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"there are two reasons for the need for medical research performed on site: on the one hand, many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent are missing."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious effects in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investments in the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a big problem."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"secondly, research that is carried out by African scientists is helping to build their own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"Dr. Ranjit Warrier is the Director of the Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ)."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"he grew up in Lusaka, Zambia in the 1990s, when the AIDS epidemic first showed serious effects on national health."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"he left Zambia for a study in the United States, first in Louisiana, later in Indiana."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"as a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself researched the HIV virus before he decided to go back home in order to support the SÃ¡bian health system."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"with Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about the misunderstandings of the media about this research."</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GM): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">"Ranjit Warrier's RW: at the moment, the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the Serbian National Programme for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests."</seg>
<seg id="2600">"in addition, I am just starting a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens."</seg>
<seg id="2601">GM: what do you think are the key current scientific topics in your country and general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">"this has to change, otherwise we will always remain recipients instead of being a doer."</seg>
<seg id="2605">"the solutions we get are often not very useful in our environment, and sometimes it is impossible to use them here."</seg>

<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are supported in a variety of ways.</seg>

<seg id="2615">"laboratory equipment is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries."</seg>
<seg id="2616">GM: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">"RW: there is already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods."</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">"GM: how large is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they focus on, and how can we support development?"</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">"there is need for special academic training, beginning at any age."</seg>
<seg id="2623">"social sciences, computer sciences, big data, study of space, health care (non-communicable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly."</seg>
<seg id="2624">Speed GV: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa vs. Western countries based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">"RW: often it is the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that presents challenges here."</seg>
<seg id="2626">"the system that magazines only make articles available against payment (the so-called" "Paywall" "), also limits the amount of information available and the speed of research."</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "open source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">"this contribution by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website of Ensia.com, a magazine about solutions for environmental problems worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outskirche, the first plant that has been grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for almost 20 years, Morton's work was limited only by his own ingenuity and the question of how many sorts of salad he can get."</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">"the patents were used not only for single varieties, but also for certain properties, such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green or crimped leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"over the past few years, more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as grain or carton types. because of this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representative of a millennia of old tradition, Morton is still breeding with salad, but he needs longer, since his work is increasingly complicated by more and more restrictions."</seg>
<seg id="2636">It is as if a boulder is lying in a river for which I have to paddle.</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do it now, but it's a break with the breeding tradition," he says. "I think that these patents go too far on salads."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they stand before judgment, nobody can breed a new type of lettuce because all features are already patented." "</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, he is very careful and endeavours to not use any material protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement that gets bigger in the USA and anywhere in the world: open Source Breeding (Open Source Breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have raised and eaten red Roman salad of the Outshroud variety in the "greenhouse" of the station. there it is tested if plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds more like the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">"the Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for open-source seed) is inspired by the movement for free" open source "software, which provides alternatives to copyrighted software."</seg>
<seg id="2645">"it was established in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property, and are thus permanently usable for plant breeders."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"as part of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders can commit themselves to the fact that others can freely use the seed bred by them."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"however, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it." open Source "breeders simply allow others who buy their seeds to breed their own varieties, and do not immediately sow - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the professor at the University of Wisconsin Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg, control of seeds and the possibility of breeding new plants is important for food security and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"according to him, seeds play a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the "open-source" movement does not concern genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grains, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not." to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over the seed, "he says, and takes on the increasingly common mergers in the global agriculture industry, as it is, for example, on farmers markets."</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible." ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to continuing to make their seeds available free of charge, as opposed to patent seed and plant traits."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk, as the available genetic pool is continuously shrinking due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material, which is therefore always available."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"such estimates do not yet exist for other plants, but experts such as Luby suspect that masked plants such as wheat are patented in an even larger style than lettuce or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are bred in such a way that they have specifically desirable traits - from those through which their taste or colour improves down to those due to which they prosper in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">"opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing by more and more patents. genetic diversity is more needful than ever, since the changing conditions caused by climate change are much worse predictive."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail, Monsanto-subscriber Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"it contradicts the view that intellectual property hinges other breeders, as" patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation. "" a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has expired. "</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to get the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"thus, such protection does not hinder innovations, but encourages them by providing more material and know-how to the public."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton looks different: 20 years to wait, until a patent expires, certainly no innovations promote innovation."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you have to wait for such a long time to breed with plants adapted to the changing environmental conditions, you would have lost the battle."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"however, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should continue to remain:" independent plant breeders do not have the time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what drives us, and it is impossible for us to continue using the best and most recent genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"in total, Morton interferes with the concept of patented plant traits:" we don't really create the features ourselves. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">"the plants form them themselves and as breeders, we ultimately have no idea how the plants do that."</seg>
<seg id="2674">A mystery of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"there is another important aspect of plant breeding for Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the US state of Oregon and Ossi."</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures are needed for their cultivation of mass herbicides that grow into its varieties of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is exactly opposite. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized companies (such that move on international markets, but smaller than Z. B. Monsanto are) patents, they manage most smaller seed companies, even without patents - either they reject the patenting or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton looks for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"furthermore, Morton believes that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patrons:" it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that patented. "</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I need constantly new material for my catalog, because I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years", "he says." "with a patent you are protected against competition for 20 years."</seg>
<seg id="2683">"although the US seems to be a leader in the" open source "breeding, the concept is spreading rapidly throughout the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (" Centre for Sustainable Agriculture "), which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources, is a" open source "seed program."</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to get to Open Source seeds and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German organization Agrecol is working on an" open source "license, which is ultimately a more formal and legally binding form of the Ossi obligation for breeders in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"(rules for breeding differ from country to country, hence the Ossi obligation can't be easily adopted one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)"</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally bred plants should not be patented."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, an explanation is not yet a law; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference on" Open Source "seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn about the" open source "seed movement and the worldwide trend towards the patenting of seeds."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' program for Open Source seed systems, explains that the organization currently builds a worldwide alliance for" open source seed systems, "which should be the official start-off next year."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"an association of environmental protection and development groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit development aid organisation USC Canada and the action group on erosion, technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database of seeds and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"in September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, has published a report."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"the report also highlights the importance of a diverse local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a context, which Luby von Ossi hopes to see him soon."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological foods has mainly taken care of where and how something is grown and seed systems have hardly played a role here," says Luby. "we are now trying to make people clear that even more is behind their food."</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organization and blog are the latest goals of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">"still, the Egyptian authorities blocked content on the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">"on the weekend of the 5th of August, the Egyptian government closed the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported on it."</seg>
<seg id="2724">"in August, the network published an opinion on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities have sharply criticised and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region."</seg>
<seg id="2725">"the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains steadfast despite this attack and the ridicule of Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who should defend the law and to give a voice to victims. even though it has never been so difficult to keep track of these goals, it has never been as important as now."</seg>
<seg id="2726">"the ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, such as the independent news page Mada Masr, the Arab-language issue of the Huffington Post and the Al Jazeera network originating from Qatar for alleged" support of terrorism.

<seg id="2728">"in addition to ANHRI, the blog of the columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada is no longer able to access Egypt."</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada took advantage of his blog for the spread of columns and articles that he writes for in Egypt non-accessible websites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">"now the blog he directed to circumvent the censorship of the Egyptian government, even the aim of an attack."</seg>
<seg id="2731">"blogger, the provider in which also Zibiblog is located, on the other hand is more accessible."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"a former photojournalist, Ziada spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video on how police practiced physical violence against two students."</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles revolve mainly around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">"in a Facebook comment, Ziada commented on the blockade by the government and reflected what this meant for him:"</seg>
<seg id="2735">"to lock blogs is very old, however, in the era of Abdelfateful al-Sisi priority; and even though the blocking of the blog may not be significant for the world, so it is for two reasons for me:"</seg>
<seg id="2736">"they succeeded in giving me the feeling of a siege. an arrest, a tried-and-tested murder, summons to the National Security Council, the blockade blogs and any other website for which I worked."</seg>
<seg id="2737">"2) They have proven that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words have influence, although only to a small audience."</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">"first, I used it to post articles to circumvent the censorship."</seg>
<seg id="2740">"however, after having locked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave go the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">"according to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte), Egyptian authorities closed their websites from May 24th to June 06th. this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat."</seg>
<seg id="2743">"also documented the blocking of providers, through the relocation of internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)"</seg>
<seg id="2744">She reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">"on Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of websites offered by VPNs began."</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice indicates the government's intention to further block and filter content that could have access to Egyptian users.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the situation is worsened in addition to the fact that the censorship decisions are made behind closed doors, so that the Egyptian population has no legal basis, by means of which it can proceed in court against these actions."</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and who will attack it next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants dispute.</seg>
<seg id="2751">"the Brazilian Army was deployed in the favelas in NiterÃ³i, a city in the State of Rio de Janeiro, during the government crisis."</seg>
<seg id="2752">"photo by: Estado Maior (CML) via photos PÃºblicas, CC-BY-NC 2.0"</seg>
<seg id="2753">"day after day, newspapers in all Brazil speak with dark headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motifs."</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old in school," "Every second day, a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is murdered," "Thieves robbing drugstore with military weapons," "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, navy and air afee to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">"in the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the force wave 2017 in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years."</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organization Global Justice even called upon the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable & # 8212; find at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"the newspaper" Extra "published for the detailed coverage of violence in Rio on August 16, published the editorial" This is not normal, "in which she announced a new section called" War in Rio. ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The paper explained the motives for their decision:</seg>
<seg id="2762">"extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder, robbery, sex crimes, etc. everything, however, deviates from the civilized standard and what happens only in Rio, is published in the category" War in Rio. "(...) This is our way of calling: this is not normal!"</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">"in a four-minute video shared on Facebook, OctÃ¡vio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper, declared that this decision was not a reason for pride, but rather a sign of failure:"</seg>
<seg id="2765">It is probably the only newspaper on the whole world with a war brik in a country that does not recognize war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">"in the same video, a journalist of the paper explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro, there are 843 areas that are controlled by criminal organisations."</seg>
<seg id="2767">"in the editorial, the newspaper writes:"</seg>
<seg id="2768">"we are aware that a war discourses, when it is distorted, can also be used to obscure the atrocities of the police that first shoot and then ask questions."</seg>
<seg id="2769">"but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners."</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" hurt more than it benefits?</seg>
<seg id="2771">"in an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, journalist CecÃ­lia Oliveira, on the other hand, argues to designate the violence as a" war. ""</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">"this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel, education and a historic and complacent neglect of public service."</seg>
<seg id="2774">"as a reminder, Rio de Janeiro's federal state is larger than its capital."</seg>

<seg id="2777">"according to CecÃ­lia, Rio de Janeiro is considered" the most violent place in Brazil, "says CecÃ­lia:" 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are in the north and north-east of the country according to statistics from 2015. "</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities is located in the State of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">"if we look at the murders per state, Rio is ranked 16," she writes. "</seg>
<seg id="2780">"extra belongs to Globo, the largest media corporation of South America, which, like CecÃ­lia, has been emphasizing the security policy of the state for years."</seg>
<seg id="2781">"these security policy measures also included the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de PolÃ­cia Pacificadora), a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003, whose objective is to capture a favela by deploying a massive police unit and permanently stationing one unit there."</seg>
<seg id="2782">"in the beginning, however, this actually led to a decrease of violent deaths. for several years, however, UPP has been getting increasingly under attack after several reports of harassment and repression against the poor communities, which should protect the newly created police unit."</seg>
<seg id="2783">"on his Facebook page, journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Charleaux cited one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria established by the Geneva Convention on the term" civil war. ""</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">"in addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as war also draws serious consequences for people."</seg>
<seg id="2786">"this requires the state to use means and means that are typical of a war. this includes penetration into the territory of a" enemy, "where a civilian is an unsharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for" collateral damage "and" lost bullets. ""</seg>
<seg id="2787">"war back or forth, the fact is that the inhabitants of the favelas in Rio continue to suffer."</seg>
<seg id="2788">"a week later, the police declared the mountain with the favela Jacarezinho to avenge the death of a policeman."</seg>

<seg id="2802">"since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime against loyalist troops."</seg>
<seg id="2803">"according to Siege Watch, a joint initiative of the Peace organization PAX and the research institute, The Syria Institute, there are currently around one million Syrians in Damascus and the surrounding area, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib."</seg>
<seg id="2804">"the East Ghouta region is particularly affected, where chemical weapons attack on 21 August 2013 demanded hundreds of civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2805">"many governments, international organisations and the Syrian opposition are based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organizations that the Assad regime has been perpetrated by Assad's regime."</seg>
<seg id="2806">"since 2013, these controlled areas have been besieged by rebels outside Damascus, which led to the need for inhabitants being locally made or dependent on food smuggled by tunnels and control points."</seg>
<seg id="2807">"through years of blockade, traditional food such as meat has become unattainable for large parts of the population."</seg>
<seg id="2808">"as a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian helpers and academics teaches the inhabitants of East Ghoutas, how they can plant their own mushrooms as" "food saving food source". ""</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and carry out the project jointly with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">"fungi do not belong to the traditional foods planted in Syria, and are rarely part of the Syrian kitchen. however, their food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieged east Ghouta."</seg>
<seg id="2811">"the Directly of the project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:"</seg>
<seg id="2812">"we decided to cultivate fungi because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because it is possible to plant them in houses and cellars."</seg>
<seg id="2813">"Ahmed Leila, one of the organizers, reports to Global Voices that for three years he has been fighting to make this project known and expressed his relief that it is now gaining more and more prominence."</seg>
<seg id="2814">"in order to earn money for the initiative, we use the humanitarian crowdfunding platform CanDo in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alnahda."</seg>
<seg id="2815">"it is planned to give 125 families knowledge of the plantation of mushrooms, according to Dr. Leila on Global Voices."</seg>
<seg id="2816">"at the time of the constitution of this article, they have reached over 100% of their expected target of some 12,700 â¬, but will continue to raise funds on CanDo until Monday, 04 September 2017."</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative is dependent on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">"because of the fuel shortage, locally produced plastic fuels are used in plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy."</seg>
<seg id="2819">"Dr. Leila said Global Voices that they started" "Production of Mushrooms from the Regions" "before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption."</seg>
<seg id="2820">"then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub. when this succeeded, they used a larger tub. and so on."</seg>
<seg id="2821">Now they have designed a "educational farm for the region."</seg>
<seg id="2822">"since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months, they have distributed fungi everywhere in East Ghouta free of charge."</seg>
<seg id="2823">Dr. Leila stated that it is part of a larger movement.</seg>

<seg id="2833">"several hundred people protested on October 21 in many districts of Portugal and called for justice for the victims of the fires, which raised in the week before in the north of Portugal."</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two persons died and about 70 injured in due to the fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the government's last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">"brandies were also registered in the Galicia region of Spain, where there were 4 deaths."</seg>
<seg id="2836">"it is estimated that there were more than 500 outbreaks spread in the northern and central regions of the country, reaching about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages."</seg>
<seg id="2837">"in June, a similar tragedy occurred in PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured."</seg>
<seg id="2838">"according to the European forest surveillance system that monitors forest land by satellite imagery, approximately 500,000 hectares of wood are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district."</seg>
<seg id="2839">So that you can make a better picture of the seriousness of the situation: there is only a fire in 4 districts.</seg>

<seg id="2845">The aim of the Saturday protests was the demand for better preventive and fire-fighting measures by the state.</seg>
<seg id="2846">People wondered why civil protection was not able to reduce the scale of the tragedy as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2847">JoÃ£o Soveral of the federal government of Portugal declared PÃºblico's paper:</seg>
<seg id="2848">"after PedrÃ³gÃ£o, streets and villages were evacuated for everything and nothing."</seg>

<seg id="2850">"in the woods of Leiria there could have been a similar tragedy like in June, as the roads were closed very late."</seg>
<seg id="2851">"furthermore, building permits in locations with high fire risk are questioned."</seg>
<seg id="2852">A wide-reaching proposal for forest reform introduced by the government after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 was objected by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments.</seg>
<seg id="2853">"the government introduced a slackening of the law which allowed the construction activity of case to fall, if the applicant had funds for self-protection - that was an open backdoor, so that everything could be built," "JoÃ£o Sorval continues in the same article of the newspaper PÃºblico."</seg>
<seg id="2854">"the environmental organisation Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus, trees made of slightly burning wood, as in a vicious circle, continue to spread after fires of this kind."</seg>
<seg id="2855">"these problems add to the fact that the website of Portugal's civil defence on 15 and 16 October, when residents looked for information or trying to contact relatives, was offline."</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided the population with information: it exploded their own civil protection data using the fogos.app and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">"the project was launched in 2015 by the developer JoÃ£o Pina to simplify the work of the fire brigade and, on this fateful weekend in October, was so crucial that the servers didn't stand up to the onslaught of the 400,000 users who followed the fires: the website counted more than half a million hits."</seg>

<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">Some days after his escape Asharaf found himself in Pakistan again.</seg>
<seg id="2888">"for a few years, he worked in a coal pit. the work was heavy and made him sick."</seg>
<seg id="2889">"then he took what was left of his small salary, and went to Iran. once again, he was in a foreign country with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortars that were heavier than himself, to earn his livelihood."</seg>
<seg id="2890">"back then, as today, Afghan refugees in Iran have been characterised by misery and exploitation."</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," Asharaf remembered in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the building site where we worked."</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services there and no heating. we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we do not freeze at night.</seg>
<seg id="2893">"after four years, Asharaf has left his life without papers in Iran and made himself ready for the journey to Europe."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"during the dangerous crossing on the sea, he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island."</seg>
<seg id="2895">"after the Greek authorities rejected asylum, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"some time Asharaf was homeless, ran through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to aid patients twice a day."</seg>
<seg id="2897">"it is true that due to relatively high rates of reference, Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers. however, it is also true that the conditions of asylum seekers in the country are catastrophic."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"the human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes, the system" suffers from a general lack of transparency. "</seg>
<seg id="2899">"the large majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in the more than 3000" "special reception centres". "these are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"according to the Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they officially have submitted an application for asylum - which can go for months after the registration of the asylum application."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"until then, people who have no money for accommodation can either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street."</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">"but his unbounded life-spirit helped Asharaf, soon to free himself from these conditions."</seg>

<seg id="2932">The Egyptian parliament has reviewed a draft bill that foresees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook just after registering with a government agency.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users would need to be able to use social networks within six months of submitting their full name as well as their ID number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who miss this step could be sentenced to six months in prison or to the end of a criminal offence.</seg>
<seg id="2935">"the Act, which was applied by sixty members of Parliament, is currently in front of the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and shall be debated there."</seg>
<seg id="2936">"in May, another MP filed a legislative proposal that would introduce harsher sentences for the insult of the President or a senior official."</seg>
<seg id="2937">"under the law of law, however, such action would be punished with prison and fines, as legal experts at Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy."</seg>
<seg id="2938">"if the law is passed, this may mean up to three years imprisonment for the convicted."</seg>
<seg id="2939">"in addition, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in jeopardy for many years."</seg>
<seg id="2940">"a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he took photos of violence against protesters who demonstrated against the military coup, which led to the incitement of the elected president Mohammed Morsi."</seg>
<seg id="2941">"as more than 700 protesters detained in the same incident, Shawkan waited for four years in prison for a trial date."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"recently, his trial was postponed to the 20th May because the prison leadership, according to the human rights groups, failed to bring the accused from prison to the courtroom."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"Shawkan mentions the death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups agree, false burdens of including weapons possession, illegal gathering, murder and attempted murder."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"in another case, a criminal tribunal in Giza called the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were indicted for their coverage of pro-Morsi sitting blockade on Raba'a Al-Adawiya Square in Cairo."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"the Court also reduced the punishment of the journalists Abdullah al-fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested in the aforementioned incident from 25 years to 5 years."</seg>
<seg id="2946">Tunisian activists intercede with infeed documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">"in May, Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat and the Global Voices Advocacy Project."</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Ben Gharbia was chiefly interrogated by the President of the Republic, who, according to the plan, expressly supports a controversial bill that would guarantee businessmen and during the former regime dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption accused of corruption."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"the document published on April 21, published on the Nawaat website, sheds light on how the presidential plans to support the bill of legislation will look like."</seg>
<seg id="2950">"Ben Gharbia rejected the nomination of his sources stating Article 11 of the Tunisian press code, which assures journalists the right to protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"nevertheless, at the District Court in Tunis on May 9th, he was a witness in the event."</seg>
<seg id="2952">Does China want to force users of social media to present their identity?</seg>
<seg id="2953">"according to new regulations of the Office of Information Bureau of the People's Republic of China, the users of social media in China require permission before they write or share messages in social media."</seg>
<seg id="2954">The regulations also indicate that the registration with the full real name will be required.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts assume that by this way the elimination of anonymous comments should be achieved within social networks. it is still unclear how the authorities will apply these rules.</seg>
<seg id="2956">Chinese citizens have proposed in social media to enforce these rules only selectively in order to protect citizen journalism and its independence.</seg>
