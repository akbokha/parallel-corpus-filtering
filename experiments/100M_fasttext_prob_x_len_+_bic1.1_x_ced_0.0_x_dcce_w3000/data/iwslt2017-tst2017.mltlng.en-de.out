this is James R@@ isen .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times re@@ porter .
&quot; long before someone had heard Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ul@@ arly that the N@@ SA illeg@@ ally heard tel@@ eph@@ ones from Americans . &quot;
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
&quot; in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation , in which the CIA literally sur@@ rendered dra@@ fts for a nuclear bomb to Iran . &quot;
&quot; if that sounds crazy , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who didn &apos;t like the chapter at all ?
the U.S. government .
&quot; for nearly 10 years , the government has established an attack against R@@ isen and called on him to call his alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this turn , he became a symbol of the pattern of government , whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower to condemn and spy journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the first constitutional amendment , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to apply this right , if media do not get this information , and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they reveal . &quot;
&quot; so when the government kno@@ cked at R@@ isen , he did something that many brave re@@ porters were already doing before him : he refused and said he would rather go to prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen was a risk to go to prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , although for years , it would be essential for their case , the government &apos;s demands were dropped in R@@ isen . &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring the re@@ porters and sources can hide themselves less and less .
&quot; instead of going to fail and raise funds to statements , that could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , secretly app@@ reh@@ ended his telep@@ hon@@ y , &quot;
&quot; just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and bank information , his loans , and even travel notes with the list of his flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information , they found evidence they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and ris@@ ky presum@@ ed source . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , but instead the judi@@ ci@@ ary condemned him more than all US governments in front of him . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as a secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article on national security has been the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower to become a journalist . &quot;
&quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional amendment because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all . &quot;
&quot; but just as the government &apos;s technology allows to circum@@ vent the rights of re@@ porters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; they can do that from the moment they contact , rather than in hind@@ sight , in the witness stand . &quot;
&quot; today there is communication software , which has not yet existed when R@@ isen had written his book , and it is much more secure than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls . &quot;
&quot; such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source transmission system for whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers , which was originally developed by the internet @-@ famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is today developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation where I am working . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news site , such as the here of the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload documents or send information , as with any common contact form . &quot;
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the relevant news agency has access .
&quot; so the government cannot obtain more information secretly , and many of the information she would request would not be available from the outset . &quot;
&quot; Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is , however , only a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s up to us to ensure that not only technology leaders such as Edward Snow@@ den have an opportunity to bring mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers , &quot;
or the next environ@@ ment@@ alist who al@@ erts alarm to the contaminated water of Flin@@ t . or a Wall Street insi@@ der that warns us of the next financial crisis .
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot;
thank you .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 the largest data volume in history was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Papers &quot; reveals that rich and powerful &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; this week we were informed of news about a leak of 11 million documents of the resident law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents gives a little insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up that ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works . &quot;
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister has res@@ igned .
&quot; also , there are reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has let@@ ter@@ box firms in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; it is claimed that a trace of US $ 2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin , about a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cell@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who wait nerv@@ ously for the next release , and to the next revealed documents . &quot;
now it sounds like the plot of an agent writer or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
&quot; it seems we@@ ep away from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should this address us ?
&quot; but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their fortune in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads . &quot;
and that concerns all of us .
&quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal . &quot;
&quot; all over the world , media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are being used by a few of them to hide and obsc@@ ure their assets -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people think this whole world is very conf@@ using , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work . &quot;
I always present it like a mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
&quot; so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these bones . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what matters . &quot;
I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the US .
&quot; presumably because there were no prominent Americans so far , who in these revelations came forward with this sc@@ andal . &quot;
now it is not that there are no rich Americans hiding their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; but by the principle behind which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ ul Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we had a data leak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in some US states , less information is needed , less information must be given to establish a firm than to get a library card . &quot;
this kind of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to pick up school children .
sc@@ amm@@ ers have allowed sc@@ amm@@ ers to rip off especially vulnerable c@@ utt@@ ings .
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice .
how does it actually work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan .
&quot; our investig@@ ator gave himself up as an African minister who wanted to bring about suspi@@ cious money to the United States to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
it really shocked us that all up to one lawyer made suggestions on how to transfer his money .
&quot; none of these lawyers took us as a client , and of course no one was given money to anyone . but it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important not to consider this as an individual case .
it is not about a single lawyer who submitted proposals to our cover@@ t investig@@ ators .
&quot; it is not about a single leader politi@@ cian , involved in a sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; and to cope with this , we have to change the rules of the game . &quot;
we have to change the rules to complic@@ ate this kind of behavior .
&quot; this may sound very b@@ ump@@ tuous , as if we could do nothing against it ; as if nothing ever changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful . &quot;
&quot; but as a borrow@@ ed optim@@ ist , I see quite a lot of things started to change . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , we have seen incidents of more transparency regarding the owners of companies . &quot;
the theme was political attention given by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
&quot; since then , the EU has been gathering in central registers at national level , who really is behind companies in Europe , and who controls it . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is behind .
&quot; representatives of both parties have introduced a draft bill in both parliamentary chambers , but this does not make the progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama revelations , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally . &quot;
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who become angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind fake companies .
we need managers in the business who get up and say : &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot;
we need leading politicians who recognise the problem and are committed to ending laws on this kind of in@@ transparency .
&quot; together we can finally end the in@@ transparency which now allows this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot;
this is the story of how I was almost ab@@ duc@@ ted and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das .
&quot; one day after I finished my design studies , I made a shop selling . &quot;
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my bel@@ ong@@ ings .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he excit@@ edly told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I got tired .
&quot; as we paid the bill , I made the mistake asking him , &quot; &quot; Where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
he made the whole thing even worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
&quot; and I thought , &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ das ! &quot;
this is a small trunk !
then I heard : &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; How do you please ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; at night I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; Oh man ! what did I rock into it ? &quot;
a wild stranger sleeps in my living room .
what if he &apos;s mad ?
&quot; I got such a fear that I stepped out of the bed , sliding at toe tips to the door , and closed my bedroom door . &quot;
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in contact .
the work of art he bought from me hangs today in his class@@ rooms . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it changed my point of view completely .
perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood were friends who were only waiting to be discovered ?
&quot; to accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s make a time jump , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am unemployed , almost bank@@ rupt , my room@@ mate leaves and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
&quot; I think creativity can create it , to transform fear into fun . &quot;
&quot; I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could make something about it . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can sleep with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , including a mattress and breakfast each morning . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ B a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors .
&quot; they found it super , and we too . &quot;
I am sure our cheese ham om@@ el@@ ets tasted completely different because we made them for our guests .
&quot; we tou@@ red with them throughout the city . when we passed our last guest and dropped the door into the castle , Brian and I star@@ ed . &quot;
had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things came rolling .
&quot; my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ us@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out whether you could make a business concept out of it .
&quot; we presented to investors : &quot; we want to create a website on which people post pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the type of room whose doors one closes when visiting . &quot;
&quot; over the internet , they can then invite strangers to stay with them . &quot;
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the missi@@ le to ign@@ ite .
&quot; indeed , they are not . &quot;
no one who is still in comfort would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because as children we all learned that foreigners are dangerous .
&quot; if you have a problem , you look at things that you can do well . we could design . &quot;
at the Academy of Arts we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it is the overall experience .
&quot; we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who had never met before . &quot;
can design make something like that ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of which degree of trust we asp@@ ire to .
it &apos;s a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I would like to unlock your mobile phone .
enter your un@@ locked mobile phone from your left wing neighbour .
this quiet approach to panic that you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they will see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile of a stranger in his hands ?
most feel the responsibility .
&quot; in this way , most guests feel comfortable when they stay somewhere else . &quot;
only for this reason can our company exist .
&quot; just like that , who actually has Al Gor@@ es mobile phone now ? &quot;
could you please tell on Twitter that he is running for the office of the President ?
you can now return the mobile phones .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you of some discoveries .
what if we had changed a small detail in this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbor had first presented himself with his name ; if he had told , where did he come from , how his dog or his children are called ? &quot;
imagine you would have 150 jud@@ gements that all say : &quot; he can really hold very well sprung mobile phones !
how would you feel if you had to hand off your mobile phone ?
&quot; for a well thought out feedback system , trust is crucial . &quot;
in the beginning we made some things wrong .
it was difficult for people to give negative jud@@ gements .
&quot; finally , we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had submitted their assessments before we put them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how prob@@ able it is that people trust each other , depending on how much they are about age and residence . &quot;
&quot; little surprisingly , we trust the most similar to the people who are most similar to us . &quot;
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social bias .
it will be exciting when you add a person &apos;s call -- in our case by assessments .
&quot; if you have less than three convic@@ tions , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but if you have more than ten , everything changes . &quot;
a good reputation came out of common ground .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted passion .
&quot; in addition , we learned that trust depends on how much you are price . &quot;
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if you tell too little , such as &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot;
&quot; one tells too much , for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request is not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , such as &quot; Tol@@ le art@@ works in your apartment ! I make a holiday with my family . &quot;
how can you create it with design to create this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which subjects to write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces against strangers .
what we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to abandon these prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people take advantage of our offer .
you can see three things .
&quot; first , incredibly good luck . &quot;
second : the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
&quot; thir@@ dly , a need that had not been met before . &quot;
&quot; for us , the business is running very well . &quot;
of course there are times when not everything runs smoothly .
there were guests who have not allowed parties to party or have devast@@ ated apartments .
hosts have guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front line when trust was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts if I just think about it .
the disappointment we hear in the voice of the c@@ aller was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves .
&quot; fortunately , the 123 million spent overnight stays only a fraction of the problem . &quot;
for people trusted each other rightly .
&quot; when trust works , wonderful things can arise . &quot;
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
perfect home for travelers who tend to heart attacks due to se@@ d@@ entary activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save lives even though they don &apos;t know one .
&quot; you drive one in your own car to the hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot;
&quot; because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they pass books . &quot;
they can stay even longer without calcul@@ ating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
&quot; this way , of course , not every stay will exp@@ ire . &quot;
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
&quot; when I stum@@ bled over this term for the first time , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together ?
it is a question of economic trade .
&quot; but now simply name &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; , &quot; the thing is not fair . &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
&quot; people have a part of themselves open , and that changes everything . &quot;
&quot; it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic . &quot;
but what if journeys would be a rich buffet of local impressions ?
&quot; what if in any place you visit , a group of Ans@@ wers would wait to fill a thoroughly and show one in a pub @-@ pent@@ ine neighborhood of which one has never heard before ; &quot;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
&quot; today , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy . &quot;
what if we would create apartments from the ground up to share ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would assume the idea of sharing their share ?
&quot; I imagine cities which enable society and relationships , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and shut @-@ off . &quot;
&quot; in South Korea capital Seoul , this project has already been started . many parking spaces that belonged to the government , &quot;
were now offered residents . students looking for a place to stay
&quot; were im@@ par@@ ted to people whose children had moved out . incub@@ ator programs were launched , &quot;
&quot; to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85@@ ,000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a foreign or even host . &quot;
so the idea doesn &apos;t seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us .
we did not re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
&quot; there was a warm welcome , too . &quot;
there were similar websites before us .
so why exactly did ours work ?
&quot; apart from luck and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust . &quot;
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
&quot; I find it amazing , &quot;
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da goes past me .
of course we know that design cannot solve any problem .
&quot; but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use design soon . &quot;
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a believer ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ? &quot;
or simply a delay in the security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you blame for your negative impressions .
this is how the media portra@@ y people that look like me .
a study found that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative .
&quot; studies show that Americans mean , most would not know Muslims . &quot;
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
&quot; for all those who have never met a Muslim , it &apos;s great to get to know you . &quot;
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra . &quot;
&quot; I am intro@@ ver@@ ted , &quot;
&quot; a Mö@@ cht@@ eg@@ ern @-@ Fitness @-@ Fan@@ ati@@ ker , &quot;
&quot; and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim . &quot;
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born that way . &quot;
I made a decision .
&quot; when I was 17 years old , I decided to ou@@ ten . &quot;
&quot; no , not as a hom@@ osexual person , like some of my friends , but as Muslims . I decided to wear hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover . &quot;
my feminist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the funny thing was : at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence , and compared to the pressure I felt as a 17 @-@ year @-@ old , I had to adapt to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal . &quot;
I have not only pas@@ sively accepted the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Koran .
&quot; I read it , thought , turned into question , doub@@ ted and ultimately believed . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
she was confident and slow dedication that deep@@ ened with every reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of rhythm sometimes brings me to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
&quot; have you ever felt that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , fully understands you , and yet loves somehow ? &quot;
that &apos;s how it feels .
&quot; later I got married and started , like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer . &quot;
&quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot; &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; breaking news . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , planes flew into buildings , people jumped out of the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical distur@@ b@@ ance ?
my shock quickly turned into ou@@ trage .
why should I do such a thing ?
&quot; I changed the TV channel and heard : &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; ... ji@@ had ... , ... &quot; ... &quot; Ji@@ had bom@@ bed Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; not only has it been attacked by my country , but in the N@@ u the actions of others transformed me into a suspect . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to travel through the Mid@@ west of the US to go to a new city and start the post@@ graduate course . &quot;
&quot; I remember how I drove -- as we drove in silence -- as deep as I was ch@@ ewing in my seat , and I was the first time I was afraid to be recognized as Muslims . &quot;
&quot; we moved into our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said : &quot; be vi@@ gil@@ ant , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Sta@@ y in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t cri@@ pple . &quot;
I stayed in the whole week .
then there was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; and again the warnings answered : &quot; &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a destination . &quot;
I saw the extensive reporting .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered , and I also heard from attacks on Muslims or from people that were held for Muslims , dra@@ gged and struck free . &quot;
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
I have got rid of the anger of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
&quot; I have nothing against questions , I love questions . &quot;
they are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
nowadays we can actually say people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims .
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as a tumor in the US body .
only the question arises : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a malign@@ ant tumour is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor is maintained only under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
&quot; like all other Americans , Muslims are not a tumour in the body of the United States , but a vital organ . &quot;
thank you !
&quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ ers and Olympi@@ ans . &quot;
will the closure of Mos@@ ques America make safer ?
&quot; there may be a few parking spaces , but not to stop the terror . &quot;
regular visiting a mosque causes people to be tolerant of other fai@@ ths and to show greater civi@@ c participation .
&quot; and as a head of the police in the Washington DC area , DC recently told me : people are actually not radic@@ alized in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radic@@ alized in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
&quot; in the process of radic@@ alisation , it has been established that it begins online . first , the person is cut off from their community , even from their family , so that the extre@@ mi@@ sts of people believe that terrorists are the real Muslims , and anyone who abh@@ ors their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or of faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radic@@ alisation , we must stop people from going to the mosque . &quot;
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human being , I believe we must do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
but we would add to their imag@@ inations if they recognize them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology on their &quot; holy book . &quot;
&quot; but if you take a look at them , they do not drive what they read in their &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things in scrip@@ ture .
an outstanding Ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she preferred to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said the problem was just the opposite . every priest with whom she spoke brought her to silence , telling her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would bring them into trouble . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing and something that gave sense to their anger , it was a major goal for the instrument@@ alization through extre@@ mi@@ sts that promised her a solution . &quot;
this Ima@@ m brought the connection to God and her church .
&quot; instead of acc@@ using them of their anger , he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world . &quot;
&quot; what she learned in the mosque , she kept going to join the IS . &quot;
this was an insight into how Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
&quot; how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ? &quot;
a study -- actually several neuro@@ logical studies -- show : if we fear we pass at least three things .
&quot; we accept rather an authorit@@ arian system of government , conformity and prejudi@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; a study shows : when people submit messages that have been reported neg@@ atively about Muslims , they are more likely to agree with military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an academic problem .
&quot; if you look at the mood against Muslims from above -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in the context of terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two election periods .
&quot; so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction of Muslim terror , as I expected . &quot;
it can actually be a manipul@@ ator to manipul@@ ate the public in order to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
&quot; we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts all of us . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the assignment of collective guilt , it is not only about having to explain itself . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple living in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
&quot; he was at the dental faculty , talented , promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would say to me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person she knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was amazed and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; when has I become such a sav@@ age young man from my brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , killed her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who visited her in the afternoon . &quot;
he fired eight times on De@@ ah .
&quot; fan@@ ati@@ cism can be not only im@@ moral , but also deadly . &quot;
so back to the start .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mosque or did we stay safe at home ?
&quot; we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about what America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can freely exercise our religion . &quot;
we decided for the mosque .
&quot; with our son in the child seat we drove in silence , with high pressure to the mosque . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , drew my shoes , went to the prayer hall , and what I saw let me stop . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half the assemblies were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who had come not to attack us , but to assist us . &quot;
at that moment I collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had brought courage and compassion to panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
are you going to be safe ?
&quot; or will you join those who think , &quot; &quot; We are better than those . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia you seem to have hit a nerve .
&quot; but I ask myself , what do you say to those who might say that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a mind@@ set with drau@@ ght , working in a noble thought factory , so an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
&quot; D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be fool@@ ed . I &apos;m completely normal . &quot;
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
&quot; when one looks at the Muslims around the world , and I did that with the largest study carried out on Muslims all over the world , people want normal things . &quot;
&quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
so I am in no way an exception .
&quot; when people like an exception tend to appear , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to rule . &quot;
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about to become a billi@@ ard business .
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions around the world . &quot;
&quot; before air package delivery into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines at the FRA@@ C Centre in France has built a six metre high tower of 1 500 bricks live in front of the audience . &quot;
&quot; by connecting flights , aircraft achieve high speed and acceleration in confined spaces . &quot;
they can also build up @-@ to @-@ themselves turn @-@ resistant structures .
&quot; they have learned to carry loads , deal with turbul@@ ence and generally react to laws of nature . &quot;
today we want to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to transc@@ end the limits of possibility in the autonomous flight .
&quot; in order for a system to operate autonom@@ ously , it is necessary to know collectively where the mobile objects are located in the room . &quot;
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
&quot; for today &apos;s demos we use a new loc@@ alization technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , an off@@ shoot of our laboratory . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
&quot; each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine calculations on board what the machine should do . &quot;
&quot; external commands exist on the highest level e. g. &quot; &quot; Start &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; land &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a so @-@ called tail @-@ starter , &quot;
a flight device that tries to beat two birds with a flap .
&quot; like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in forward flying , much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most startup cur@@ sors , it can fluctu@@ ate and thus has great advantages at start and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a down@@ side . &quot;
a limitation of h@@ edge @-@ star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to tur@@ mo@@ il like wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
&quot; the idea behind it is that the flight device , no matter in which position , reco@@ vers the optimal position and the performance can be improved by practicing . &quot;
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions , which advance to the core of the matter . &quot;
&quot; such a question would be , for example , what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ? &quot;
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
&quot; helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts , which meet to hurt you . &quot;
&quot; decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly remote @-@ controlled aircraft , which had only two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder . &quot;
&quot; recently , we discovered that flying with only one thing worked . &quot;
&quot; this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically simplest remote @-@ operated flight device . it was invented recently . &quot;
&quot; it has only a movable part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no cl@@ apping , hing@@ es and cross ru@@ dder , no further actu@@ ators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , very much happens inside the interior , so that it can fly stable , and move anywhere in the room . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the tail @-@ star@@ ters . to bring it to flying , I have to throw it right . &quot;
&quot; the likel@@ ihood of throwing it right , if you all see me is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening . &quot;
&quot; if the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in cru@@ el@@ ty , this machine is here , the bus with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ rical .
that is why he is ambi@@ valent in his alignment .
&quot; thus , he receives the extraordinary ability , &quot;
&quot; move in the room in all directions , no matter in which direction it is rot@@ ated or even rot@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers . &quot;
&quot; a lot is imagin@@ able in models , the rest is learned directly when flying . &quot;
let &apos;s look at this .
&quot; when flying machines are to be part of everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine consists of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller machines .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the other counter @-@ clock@@ wise .
&quot; when one builds them together , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; but if something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller fails , the electronics or a battery - the machine can still fly , even if limited . &quot;
we will now demonstrate this by making half f@@ light@@ less .
the last demonstration uses synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we took commercially available micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ters -- every single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where space it is and is self @-@ controlled . that is why there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations motiv@@ ate you to think out new revolutionary ideas .
&quot; on Broadway , the particularly safe machine would like to be a flying lamp@@ shade . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology . &quot;
&quot; for types like us , wages are in development and creative act . &quot;
&quot; it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures to form them in such a spectacular way . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
&quot; 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes surrounded each other in a very far distant gal@@ axy ; they converted the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second into pure energy . &quot;
for this short moment they illuminated bri@@ ghter than all stars together in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the entire universe known to us .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not set up their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into space @-@ time structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us first arrange the events in the event of time .
&quot; 1.3 billion years ago , a multi @-@ cell life was created on Earth . &quot;
&quot; since then the earth has brought forth a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , people and -- God is at us -- even the Internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago , a group of particularly bold -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver decided to build a huge laser detector from Cal@@ tech -- to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , which originate from col@@ li@@ ding black holes . &quot;
most of them thought they were crazy .
&quot; but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation financed her idea . &quot;
&quot; after decades of development , design , design and extremely hard work they built the detector Lig@@ o : the laser @-@ interfer@@ omet@@ er- gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; in the following period , the precision of Lig@@ o could be considerably increased , which greatly improved the recognition performance . &quot;
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
&quot; at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a last test run to clarify some minor , persistent problems . &quot;
&quot; on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the commissioning of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes ch@@ apped through the earth . &quot;
you went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the farewell from my father @-@ to @-@ death father .
basically it was the fruits of my life .
&quot; AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has studied gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of black holes for 23 years and their observ@@ atories like Lig@@ o meas@@ urable signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves ? &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a c@@ row in the structure of space and time .
&quot; when moving the shaft , the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and st@@ out into the other . &quot;
&quot; for illustr@@ ative purposes , lec@@ turers in courses on the theory of rel@@ ativity often lead to a really old dance . &quot;
&quot; stretching and du@@ sting , stretching and du@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous . &quot;
&quot; on September 14th , for example , each of us was stretched and qu@@ aked at the arrival of the waves . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; that is 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . &quot;
&quot; with a five @-@ kilometre @-@ long laser detector , and this is already absurd , this length would have to be measured in less than one thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of a nuclear nucleus . this is gr@@ ot@@ esque . &quot;
at the end of his classic text about gravity
&quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder Lig@@ os , described the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; technical difficulties in building such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot;
&quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public , all obstacles will be overcome . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to say Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wavel@@ ength , which is much smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your cell . &quot;
&quot; this is quite practical , because so you can make a picture or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light coming around you from several points . &quot;
&quot; in sounds , it is different . &quot;
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that are particularly important to you : &quot;
take care of your child &apos;s face .
&quot; instead , we listen to certain properties such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume to close the story behind . &quot;
&quot; now , just Alice speaks . &quot;
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts them . &quot;
&quot; du@@ mmer Bob , &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot make simple pictures of objects in space with them .
&quot; but by watching changes in the ampl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in audi@@ ble range .
&quot; so , when we convert wave patterns in sound , we can literally hear the universe . &quot;
&quot; to listen to the gravity can tell us about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy for quite a long time . &quot;
&quot; SH : two black , not rotating holes , just run : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
&quot; turn the two bodies very quickly , you can hear the same chir@@ ping with an additional key change . this sounds like W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu ! &quot;
&quot; it is a type of movement vocabulary , im@@ printed in the wa@@ ve@@ form . &quot;
&quot; AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Lig@@ o heard the following : &#91; Sur@@ render noise &#93; Any@@ one who knows what he has to hear , sees this as a noise of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which rotate around as fast as the bars of your sha@@ ker . &quot;
AA : let &apos;s think about what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , cir@@ cling a hundred times a second before col@@ li@@ ding . &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we heard it .
therein lies the remaining meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o opens up a completely new way to explore the universe as it has never been possible before .
on this path we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible .
much in space we can -- practically or fundamentally -- not see .
&quot; a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in super@@ nov@@ as . &quot;
they are very useful . we have learned a lot about them all .
&quot; the exciting physical processes happen , however , in the core hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon . &quot;
we will never see through as these op@@ ak are .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would love to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them as the Big B@@ ang is covered by its own after@@ glow . &quot;
using gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
&quot; the most important thing : I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen , which we will never see , and which we have no idea of . things that we only discover by listening . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Lig@@ o found things right in the first attempt that we didn &apos;t expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says to this topic : me : the kind of stars that highlight black holes , like Lig@@ o they observe , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , age @-@ old bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are , so to speak , the din@@ osau@@ r bones for our archaeological work . &quot;
&quot; Lig@@ o gives us a completely different view of the events in space , to the emergence of the stars and ultimately to how we came out of this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge now is to be as courageous as possible .
&quot; thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the ro@@ aring and chir@@ ping of the cosmos . &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
because what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big B@@ ang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
&quot; some time ago , I tried out an experiment . &quot;
&quot; for one year , I would say &quot; yes ! &quot; I was afraid of . &quot;
&quot; no matter whether it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say &quot; &quot; yes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to be live on TV ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to start playing ?
&quot; no , no , no , but yes , yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : exactly what I was afraid to do , I removed my fear . &quot;
&quot; my fear of keeping speeches , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , away . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; has changed my life .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
&quot; but there was a certain Yes , which changed my life deeply , on an unexpected way . it started with a question of my little ones . &quot;
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the South .
&quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I need milk for my beak @-@ cup . &quot;
&quot; she asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
this yes was the beginning
&quot; a new attitude towards life in my family . from then on , I am wa@@ sting to always play with them once you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing or where I go , I always say Yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I &apos;m very tired . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , on my children , on our family . &quot;
&quot; but it also has a start@@ ling side effect : only recently I really understood that the &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; to play with my children saved my career . &quot;
I have a real dream job .
&quot; I am a writer . I think things out , wake up to life . &quot;
dream job .
no . no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I scre@@ amed TV . I produce television .
&quot; I do TV , in a big style . &quot;
in this TV season I am responsible for taking 70 hours of program into the world .
&quot; four TV programmes , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production . &quot;
each shipment has hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV station can lie between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
&quot; a new episode every nine days four shows , so all nine days 20 million dollars television , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three programmes simultaneously in production four , 16 episodes : sli@@ mming , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV , &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV series run one after another on Thursday evening .
&quot; all over the world , my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers . &quot;
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are programmes that I have created myself , and not only produced , so on top of it . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fires burning around the world . &quot;
do you know who still does it ?
&quot; no one , that &apos;s why I am a Titan . &quot;
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with this .
I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
&quot; I tell you so that all of you who are working so hard , whether you are running a company , a country or a classroom , take me seriously if I speak of work , so you understand that I &apos;m not just around the computer and f@@ anci@@ er , and it &apos;s true when I say : I don &apos;t understand it &apos;s going to dream with a dream job . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s all a job , all work , everything reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work a lot , hard , and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I am immersed in the work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
&quot; it is as if I set up troops , as I painted on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; as a result of a high sound , a marathon ran . &quot;
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love working .
&quot; she is creative , mechan@@ ically , ti@@ ring and intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and sensible . &quot;
there is such a change in me when the work goes well .
&quot; a sw@@ amp starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the hum@@ ming sounds like a busy street , I could always drive on it . &quot;
many people participate when I explain to them the hum@@ ming that I am talking about writing that writing gives me joy .
&quot; don &apos;t understand me wrong , it does it . &quot;
&quot; but the sums -- when I began to work and work , to work and to work , to create , create and collaborate , I discovered this thing , this sum , this energy . &quot;
the sum is more than writing .
the Sum@@ ma is action and activity . the Sum@@ ma is a drug .
the bu@@ zz is music . the hum@@ ming is light and air .
the Sum@@ mon is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a sum , then you cannot strive for size . &quot;
&quot; feeling not to be different than to strive for size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called the Sum@@ ma .
or perhaps it also means being a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it &apos;s called genius .
perhaps it &apos;s called the ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; I just know that I &apos;m not made for failure , and I just know I love the sums . &quot;
&quot; I just want to tell you , I am a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it . &quot;
&quot; the more successful I become , the more episodes the more episodes , the more work there are , the more things happen at the same time , the more I write history , the more expectations are there . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; the country I create , the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the high clay , the sums , the sums , the sums . &quot;
I like this sum . I love the hum@@ ming .
I need the sums . I am the sum .
am I just this hum@@ ming ?
and then the sw@@ amp stopped .
&quot; over@@ hau@@ led , over@@ loaded , over@@ hau@@ led , burned out . &quot;
the sw@@ amp stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that her mom@@ my is a single institute .
&quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ um won &apos;t be there , but you can write to my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da land . &quot;
they are the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are Baby @-@ Tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sums were stopped . &quot;
the hum@@ ming of the engine stopped .
I didn &apos;t love my job any more . the engine was out .
the sums did not come back .
my sw@@ amp was broken .
&quot; I did the same things as usual : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , worked weekends , no regre@@ ts , nothing deleg@@ ate , a titanium does not sleep , does not give up , with whole heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no hum@@ ming .
in me was silence .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
&quot; I was a showcase Titan , &quot;
&quot; everything was grey , I just had no more fun . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the hum@@ ming and the hum@@ ming I was .
&quot; so what do you do if what you do , the work you love suddenly fade away ? &quot;
&quot; I know some may think : &quot; how@@ l , stupid author Titan . &quot;
&quot; but you know you do it , you do it , you love what you do , be a teacher , be a ban@@ ker , a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love another and that gives one the bu@@ zz when you know the sw@@ amp , who is you ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ? &quot;
&quot; and then my &quot; &quot; southern state wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; asks me a question . &quot;
&quot; I am on the way to the outside , late in it and she says , &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you like to play ? &quot;
and I don &apos;t want to say no more than two things can be made aware of :
&quot; first , I have to say yes to everything and secondly , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she does not call anyone &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens &quot; . &quot; &quot;
when did that happen ?
&quot; I miss it when I &apos;m Titan and my sw@@ amp smo@@ kes , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you like to play ? &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about that .
&quot; we play and her sisters meet , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding , because my pain and panic , lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of money , I can &apos;t do anything except to watch out . &quot;
I am focused .
I am quiet .
&quot; the country I create , the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the high clay - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; everything that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and wet kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wa@@ xing pen@@ cils and the song in which it goes without letting go , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen &quot; lets go . &quot;
peace and simplicity everywhere are everywhere .
the air in this place is so short that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ solves .
a mental door goes on and an energy boost comes in .
&quot; and this does not happen immediately , but it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the hum@@ ming slowly returns .
&quot; no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there . &quot;
&quot; not the sum , but a sum . &quot;
and now I feel like I would know a magical secret .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . just love .
it is something that we have forgotten .
&quot; the sums , the sums of work , the sums of title , that is only the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I describe me with the help of broad@@ casts and television hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum is . &quot;
the sums are not force and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real sum is dependent on love .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing is the current that comes from the z@@ est of life .
the real hum@@ ming is self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; the real sum ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be accomplished , the expectation and the pressure . &quot;
the real sw@@ amp is simple and original .
&quot; the real sw@@ amp is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered to me the wrong words , for what God told me that I am a Titan ? &quot;
it is simply love .
&quot; we all need a bit more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
&quot; I make this a fixed rule , so that I can free myself from any blame as a work@@ ah@@ olic . &quot;
&quot; it is law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice if I want to hear the sums again . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
&quot; playing is not enough to me , as we work . &quot;
&quot; the truth hur@@ ts , &quot;
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer working at the workplace than at home .
&quot; this admission is painful , because what kind of person prefers to be rather than home ? &quot;
&quot; well , I . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I call myself &quot; Titan . &quot; &quot;
I have to have problems .
&quot; that I am too relaxed , none of them . &quot;
&quot; we r@@ attle in the garden , before and back , back and forth . &quot;
&quot; we make small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we sh@@ atter soap bubbles .
&quot; in doing so , I mostly feel stiff , absent and confused . &quot;
I always take care of my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the hum@@ ming of the universe fills me . &quot;
I play and play until I ask myself : why did we stop playing ?
you can also do it ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
&quot; perhaps you consider me na@@ ï@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; you &apos;re right , but you can do it too ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
&quot; my little ones want to play with me at the most 15 minutes , until they think they want to do something different . &quot;
&quot; it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes a Mari@@ enk@@ äfer or cookie replaces me .
&quot; and when my teen@@ age daughter talks to me for about 15 minutes , I am the mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; it is only 15 minutes , there is no need for it . &quot;
&quot; everyone can spend 15 minutes on the track , even on a bad mood ! &quot;
15 minutes on the piece !
&quot; no mobile phone , no laundry , no distra@@ ction . &quot;
&quot; the day is short : dinner , the children are getting ready for bed . &quot;
but 15 minutes are in it !
&quot; my children are my well @-@ being , my world . they don &apos;t have to be the children . it is important to feel the hum@@ ming , to have a place for peace of mind . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about pleasure , &quot;
&quot; in order to &quot; &quot; play &quot; &quot; in general . &quot;
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find out and keep it up .
&quot; I &apos;m not perfect in it . I fail and I win . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day -- &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in training when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot;
&quot; 15 minutes on the track , why not take full 15 minutes ? &quot;
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sw@@ amp came back in my free time . the sw@@ amp seems to return when I don &apos;t work .
working does not work without playing .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy po@@ urs in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul . &quot;
&quot; I like the sums , but I don &apos;t love it . &quot;
I don &apos;t need it .
&quot; I am not the sum , the sum is not me ... no more . &quot;
&quot; soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is my tot@@ ality .
the tot@@ ality of life .
the tot@@ ality of love .
&quot; the sum of the work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so grateful for that . &quot;
it &apos;s gon@@ na be that I am a Titan . I have never seen a Titan who is going on a trip to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still working . my camp@@ fire is still burning .
&quot; the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the clearer my head is . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the sums . the country I create , the marathon , which I run , the troops , the screens , the high clay , the sums , the sums , the other , the right sums : the sum of life . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this total , the more this unusual , consistent , naked and new feeling of life spreads in me . less Titan -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this total , the more I know who I am . &quot;
&quot; I am a writer . I think things out , I wake you up to life . &quot;
&quot; this is part of the job , which means living your dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
for a dream job should be a bit dre@@ amy .
&quot; I said &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day .
I know how your life can change from one second to the other after a heavy stroke or after a car accident .
&quot; for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent disability . &quot;
this is probably the reason why I became functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nervous functions through various surgical measures .
&quot; they certainly have heard of one of the most known , the &quot; deep brain stimulation . &quot; in doing so , one conduc@@ ts an electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits of the neur@@ ons so that the neuro@@ logical function is improved . &quot;
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease who suffered severe trem@@ ors and severe pain .
&quot; neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing . &quot;
the dream of functional neuro@@ surgeon is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
with some help the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at that time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room .
often I supplied patients with skull @-@ brain trauma .
you have to imagine that in skull @-@ brain trauma the brain sw@@ ells and the cran@@ ial pressure increases .
&quot; in order to save life , it is necessary to reduce cran@@ ial pressure . &quot;
&quot; for this , sometimes a part of s@@ wollen brain mass must be removed . &quot;
&quot; instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the mass of the brain with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist . &quot;
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to let cells grow from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
to grow cells from a tissue is comparable to very small children who are taken out of their families .
&quot; it is necessary to find proper nutrition , temperature , humidity and environments to flour@@ ish . &quot;
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
&quot; after many attempts , Jean @-@ François succeeded . &quot;
he saw that under his microscope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells . &quot;
&quot; perhaps you still know from biology classes , that stem cells are im@@ mature cells that can transform into every cell type of the organism . &quot;
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operating room .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they divide very quickly .
they never die ; they are immort@@ al .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they split slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently . &quot;
we needed long to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ ble@@ man @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the fo@@ etus stage they provide for the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay with us ?
we do not know this .
&quot; we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations near brain injuries . &quot;
&quot; however , this is not so certain . &quot;
&quot; one thing , however , is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells . &quot;
&quot; we are facing a potential cell source , enabling brain healing . &quot;
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells in exactly the same way as Jean @-@ François did .
and they then color their color in order to be able to track them in the brain .
&quot; in the final step , we re @-@ planted them at the resolution of the same individual . &quot;
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- auto@@ transplan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we re @-@ implant these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we re @-@ implant the same cells into damaged brain tissue ?
&quot; thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ il@@ ler , we were able to work with apes . &quot;
&quot; in the first scenario we re @-@ planted the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they had been removed , they go back home . &quot;
in the second scenario we perf@@ ected an injury and re @-@ planted exactly the same cells and now the cells remained - they grew to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we were able to observe under the microscope .
these are the cells that have been re @-@ planted .
&quot; the evidence they show are these little points . these are the cells that we in vitro , dy@@ e in culture . &quot;
&quot; of course , we could not stop here . &quot;
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained apes with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take feed pellets from a tray .
they did it very well .
&quot; when they reached a stable level of skill , we injured the motor motor sector in the motor cor@@ tex . &quot;
&quot; then the monkeys were paraly@@ sed , they couldn &apos;t move their hand any more . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen to people , they spontaneously re@@ covering up to a certain degree , just as after a stroke . &quot;
patients are paraly@@ sed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms .
&quot; when we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells . &quot;
&quot; on the left hand side , they see the monkey who spontaneously recovered . &quot;
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from before injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
&quot; see now , when we re @-@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the implantation . &quot;
I can tell you that were very exciting results for us too .
&quot; since that time , we have found out much more about these cells . &quot;
we can freeze them and use them later .
&quot; we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
but our dream is still to im@@ pl@@ date it with people .
I really hope that I can soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
&quot; Luigi Giussani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that right now , several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can need it . &quot;
I definitely do .
&quot; of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials on humans . &quot;
&quot; J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results , you have to fill two kilograms of paper and forms to go through this type of studies . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : it &apos;s hard to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the approval of the clinical study . &quot;
will it allow us the authority to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this type of treatment .
&quot; after that , it is necessary to apply this to a multi@@ center study . &quot;
first you really have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone .
&quot; BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course . &quot;
&quot; BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne , thank you for visiting TED and told us about it . &quot;
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to look at them as self @-@ evident .
&quot; we don &apos;t see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is , but as an inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to look at her as an imm@@ utable fact .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
&quot; Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ev from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing have proved without doubt that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; in fact , democracy is d@@ wind@@ ling with us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally clear to me as a finance minister in the Euro@@ group -- that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- could not influence the austerity programs implemented in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at that moment I thought there might be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my bud@@ ding friends who told me repeatedly that democracy would be abol@@ ished if it would change anything . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy . &quot;
&quot; I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group are mistaken , we could save democracy , but that we need a tru@@ thful and def@@ en@@ cel@@ ess democracy . &quot;
&quot; without democracy , our societies are becoming more ble@@ ak , our future ble@@ ak , and our great new technologies are wasted . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of waste , I would like to remind you of an interesting contradiction that currently threat@@ ens our economies . &quot;
I call it the &quot; Twin @-@ Summit @-@ Par@@ ad@@ ox . &quot;
&quot; a top is known to you . you know and recognize it as the mountain of debt , which casts its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all recognize the mountain of debt , &quot;
but only a few recognize his twin .
&quot; a mountain of unused cash , which is one of the weal@@ thier econom@@ ists and corporations , who , however , are too fear@@ ful to invest there where it would be productive and contribute to the production of all the things that humanity desper@@ ately needs , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; in the past 3 months , in the United States , England and the euro@@ zone , 3.4 billion US dollars were invested in all the wealth of producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so on . &quot;
&quot; $ 3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion credits after much money until one compar@@ es it to the $ 5.@@ 1 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollar , which at the same time circul@@ ated in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing to infl@@ ate except the stock exchanges and raise the real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; thus , debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin summit which cannot be compensated by the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result is stagn@@ ant wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe unemployed , and consequently a low overall economic demand which , as in a final loop , feared the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , in which they would not invest in which they would not invest . &quot;
in@@ adver@@ t@@ ently bring about the circumstances leading to killing O@@ edi@@ pus .
that is my hatred with capitalism --
&quot; all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to further develop human talents and to finance especially all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth . &quot;
so is democracy the solution ?
&quot; but before we continue , what do we mean by democracy ? &quot;
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the social form in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government .
&quot; of course , the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy included too many . &quot;
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake to mi@@ tig@@ ate the significance of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy on account of these exclu@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; the decisive factor in the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it received the working arms , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , that they admitted the right to political participation with the same voice wei@@ ghting in questions of the state of the state . &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy did not last long --
&quot; like a candle , which illumin@@ ates very brigh@@ tly , it is also quickly burned out . &quot;
&quot; however , our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies do not have their roots in ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthening the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a statute for ruling classes . &quot;
&quot; the liberal democracy first arose when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was confined to politics , while the economy -- that is , the world of corporations -- became a democr@@ ati@@ zed zone . &quot;
&quot; in our demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle took place between the two by gradually under@@ mining politics and em@@ itted them . &quot;
do you wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it does not lie on a degeneration of their DNA .
&quot; it is because today it is possible to be in the government , and yet not in power , because the power is immig@@ rated from politics into the economy and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my hatred with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it is like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es , which so sustain@@ ably has dec@@ im@@ ated the animals of which they nour@@ ish themselves , that they are star@@ ving at the end . &quot;
&quot; it is similar to the economy that has har@@ med politics so far that it har@@ ms itself through the self @-@ caused economic crisis itself . the power of the corporations is growing , political goods are being depreci@@ ated , the ine@@ quality grows , the general economic demand falls and the corporate managers are too sc@@ ared to invest in the cash of their companies . &quot;
&quot; the more successful capitalism drives the &quot; demos &quot; of democracy , the higher the twin @-@ summit , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of mankind . &quot;
&quot; if this is true , it is obvious that we must bring back politics and the economy and it would be better if the &quot; demos &quot; keep control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
&quot; by the way , this is not a new idea . &quot;
the Marxist Left had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good .
the doctrine of the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new types of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is a solution : to abol@@ ish the working poor !
capitalism does it by sub@@ stit@@ uting low wage workers by automation and robots .
&quot; the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the tw@@ ins higher , the waste becomes more sub@@ lime , and social conflicts are deeper , as I believe -- in countries like China . &quot;
&quot; so we have to re@@ design the economy and re@@ unite the business and politics sectors , and ensure that we are democr@@ ati@@ zing the re @-@ united area , otherwise we end up in a dise@@ ased surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cracy , which makes the film &quot; matrix &quot; as a documentary . &quot;
&quot; the question is , therefore , not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has produced . &quot;
&quot; the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to that in &quot; Matrix , &quot; or something similar to that of society in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ ener &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; indul@@ ging in long talks to the meaning of life . &quot;
I think we must be optimistic .
&quot; so what would it look like , how could it look like this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; -@@ similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot;
&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples . &quot;
&quot; in the area of companies : please introduce a capital market where you earn money while working and in which your capital is following you from one office to the next , and the company -- no matter what you are working at -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company . &quot;
&quot; then all income comes from capital and revenue , and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
&quot; no distinction between those who belong to the companies but who do not work in it , and employees who work there , but the company does not belong to them . no exchange between capital and labour , no large gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no lifting twin tops . &quot;
&quot; in the sphere of global political economy : please introduce briefly that our national currencies would have issued a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interests of all humanity . &quot;
&quot; imagine that all world trade is traded in this currency - call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; cosmos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country , into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to put it into practice .
&quot; today , we have them , in particular against the background of a re@@ unified policy and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world I describe is at the same time a volunteer in which it prefers privileged people , and Marxist , because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the garbage of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , global Key@@ nes@@ ian . &quot;
but above all else it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy .
will we aw@@ aken in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
&quot; it is in our hands , and we do it better democr@@ atically . &quot;
thank you .
Bruno Fr . Giussani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography as liberal Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and business is ... Do we not do that , technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand , what Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers calls for &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next , as we currently experience , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ ze our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant , &quot;
&quot; like Ha@@ ye@@ k , therefore I am a liberal Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that is why I am also perfect . &quot;
&quot; BG : actually , and now we are well . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if you &apos;re not stupid , you don &apos;t think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said that . BG : in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have clearly said what you think of the West &apos;s view on China . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the appearance of democracy .
&quot; as I said in my talk , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of it is playing -- the sphere of economics -- is a fully democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in some respects , if I may say so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar to that of England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; for -- remember -- we tend to link liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake , historically considered . &quot;
&quot; liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill -- &quot;
he was particularly scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
&quot; what we can observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; China is now propos@@ ing to do what the West has done in the nineteenth century , smells of hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I am sure that many listeners were curious about their experience as Greek Finance Minister at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I suspected that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later in the first half of the year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the euro@@ zone , &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; namely to say good @-@ bye to compl@@ ac@@ ency , and the constant denial that a massive de@@ ar@@ ming line passed through the Eurozone , and continues to massi@@ vely thre@@ aten the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity to come on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which , by the way , was the first suggestion that revealed this denial -- &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the European Group , continued to den@@ ounce the denial . &quot;
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; if you try to get an economic system that is not viable , by political will and authorit@@ ari@@ anism , you might be able to delay it for a while , but when the change occurs it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive . &quot;
BG : what changes do you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as a finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Ernst ...
&quot; if there is a finance minister or any minister who is in office after 6 months , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he has made no mistake , then this is a dangerous person . &quot;
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the len@@ ders of the len@@ ders to find a common solution .
but that wasn &apos;t .
&quot; they merely wanted to bring our government , just because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions that were running through the Eurozone . &quot;
they did not want to admit that they had been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic programme in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
it &apos;s worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; none of the tro@@ ika &apos;s tro@@ ika , who imposed this policy on us , stood up : &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of the talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot;
my biggest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive .
&quot; for if they do not survive , the exposed centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; if we allow ourselves to take the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , after which it appears to me , it will be equally detri@@ mental to the future of the Europeans as well as non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope that you will be wrong at this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you for being with TED . &quot;
Y@@ V : thank you .
&quot; of Roy Price most have never heard , although he probably is responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 . &quot;
&quot; probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for so many of you . &quot;
that goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
&quot; Roy Price is the leading employee at Amazon Studios , &quot;
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has an I@@ gel@@ fr@@ is@@ ur and refers to Twitter as &quot; Mo@@ vies , TV , Technology , Tac@@ os . &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for choosing the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
&quot; of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought business . &quot;
there are already so many TV shows that Roy cannot choose any one .
&quot; he has to find shows , which are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he has to find shows that are on the right corner of this curve . &quot;
this curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows will receive this review .
&quot; if your show is valued at nine and above , it will be a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that addic@@ ts where , after watching a season , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left side , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve . &quot;
Roy Price does not worry about getting on the left side of the curve because I think you need special intelligence to accommodate &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
&quot; he makes more thoughts about the average payout , the average TV -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t exc@@ ite . &quot;
so he must make sure he is really on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is there , and of course it &apos;s the first time that Amazon is doing such a thing , so Roy Price wants nothing to risk . &quot;
he wants to create successes .
&quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight Candi@@ dates for TV shows through an evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and presents them online , where everyone can watch them free of charge . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon publishes things for nothing , do you get up to it , right ? &quot;
millions of viewers watch these episodes .
&quot; however , they don &apos;t know they are watched when watching these shows . &quot;
they are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
&quot; when you start the show , when you pause , which parts you skip or look at once again . &quot;
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce .
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com about four Republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t that good . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and alpha House lan@@ det at 7,5 -- so something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; at the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a little different . &quot;
&quot; instead of organizing a competition , he and his team looked at the available data about the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews they give the shows their course , what shows they like , etc . &quot;
&quot; then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : which shows they like , what producers , what actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the parts together they went into a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; &quot; House of Cards &quot; . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted . &quot;
&quot; of course , the question is : what is happening here ? &quot;
&quot; they have two very competitive , data sealed companies . &quot;
&quot; they connect these many data to each other , and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company . &quot;
what is that ?
because logic somehow states that it should work in everything .
&quot; if you collect millions of data , for a decision you meet , you should make a good decision . &quot;
you have 200 years of statistics as a back @-@ up .
it is optimized through very powerful computers .
&quot; the least thing you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis does not work so , this is a little frigh@@ tening because we live in a time when we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television . &quot;
does anybody know the multi @-@ health system company ?
&quot; no one . OK , that &apos;s even good . &quot;
&quot; multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one ever comes into contact with this software in this room . if you come into contact with it , you are in prison . &quot;
&quot; if someone here in the U.S. is in prison and asks for release , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge occurs or not . &quot;
&quot; just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding if a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
&quot; not always the best results are generated , which is not because a company such as Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data . &quot;
also the data of the most experienced companies are wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that it can predict out@@ breaks of flu , the evil way , by analyzing the Google research through data analysis . &quot;
it worked wonderfully and was a big news sensation . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked flaw@@ lessly , year by year , until it suddenly stopped working , &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; it simply did not work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data rever@@ sible companies like Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; despite all these errors , data stream rapidly into decisions of life -- at work , legal enforcement , in medicine . &quot;
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ aided genetics - an area where some very smart people uni@@ mag@@ in@@ ably use many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years I have recognized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be dissemin@@ ated .
&quot; if you have to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things : &quot;
&quot; first , you dis@@ assemble this problem in its components so that you can analyze the individual parts ; as a second , you put the items together again to make a decision . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again . &quot;
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to disman@@ tle a problem and to understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to re@@ assemble the parts and then come to a decision .
there is another tool and we all possess it : our brain .
&quot; if there is something in which the brain is good , it &apos;s parts and pieces to compose again , even if the information is incomplete , in order to make a good decision - especially if it is the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and intelligence , where they also belong in the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their audience , why they wouldn &apos;t have been able otherwise . but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like &quot; &quot; House of Cards &quot; &quot; was not in the data . &quot;
&quot; T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team made this decision for this show , which meant they had a great personal risk with this decision . &quot;
&quot; Amazon , on the other hand , did so in the wrong way . &quot;
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first when competing for TV ideas , then selecting &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; as a show . &quot;
&quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; this is telling us the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data are helpful for better decisions , but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and to avoid this , this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will ...
&quot; before there was data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
&quot; it &apos;s also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or No @-@ question , you only have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- right here at this moment . &quot;
I will challenge it later with a demo of technology .
&quot; so far I have made some decisions in my life , whereby I should have listened to the ball in retro@@ sp@@ ect . &quot;
&quot; but , as you naturally know , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them with something much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the basic structure .
&quot; in the end it &apos;s up to us to make decisions , if we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right turn . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as a very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data still paying off , decisions are made to be an expert in what you are doing , and taking risks . &quot;
&quot; at the end , it is not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thank you very much .
