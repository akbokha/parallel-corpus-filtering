<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before someone had heard Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA illegally heard telephones from Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation, in which the CIA literally surrendered drafts for a nuclear bomb to Iran."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if that sounds crazy, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who didn't like the chapter at all?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for nearly 10 years, the government has established an attack against Risen and called on him to call his alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this turn, he became a symbol of the pattern of government, whistleblower to condemn and spy journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the first constitutional amendment, the media have the right to publish secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"but it is impossible to apply this right, if media do not get this information, and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they reveal."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government knocked at Risen, he did something that many brave reporters were already doing before him: he refused and said he would rather go to prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen was a risk to go to prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, although for years, it would be essential for their case, the government's demands were dropped in Risen."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring the reporters and sources can hide themselves less and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of going to fail and raise funds to statements, that could also do his digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so the investigators, without his consent, secretly apprehended his telephony,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"just like his e-mail data, financial and bank information, his loans, and even travel notes with the list of his flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information, they found evidence they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and risky presumed source."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama promised to protect whistleblower, but instead the judiciary condemned him more than all US governments in front of him."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of its work as a secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, almost every article on national security has been the result of a whistleblower to become a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional amendment because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just as the government's technology allows to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"they can do that from the moment they contact, rather than in hindsight, in the witness stand."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today there is communication software, which has not yet existed when Risen had written his book, and it is much more secure than normal e-mails or phone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such technology is SecureDrop, an open source transmission system for whistle-blowers, which was originally developed by the internet-famous Aaron Swartz, and is today developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation where I am working."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news site, such as the here of the Washington Post."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can upload documents or send information, as with any common contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the relevant news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government cannot obtain more information secretly, and many of the information she would request would not be available from the outset."</seg>
<seg id="36">"SecureDrop is, however, only a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century."</seg>
<seg id="37">"sorry, there is no translation for this news-article."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it's up to us to ensure that not only technology leaders such as Edward Snowden have an opportunity to bring misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistle-blowers,"</seg>
<seg id="39">Or the next environmentalist who alerts alarm to the contaminated water of Flint. or a Wall Street insider that warns us of the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016 the largest data volume in history was published.] [the "Panama Papers" reveals that rich and powerful] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] this week we were informed of news about a leak of 11 million documents of the resident law firm Mossack Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a little insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies like Mossack Fonseca and say:" "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up that?"</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see the e-mails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's prime minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">"also, there are reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has letterbox firms in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is claimed that a trace of US $2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin, about a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who wait nervously for the next release, and to the next revealed documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the plot of an agent writer or a John-Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems weep away from you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should this address us?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their fortune in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads."</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"all over the world, media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax havens are being used by a few of them to hide and obscure their assets -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people think this whole world is very confusing, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always present it like a matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these bones."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what matters."</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the US.</seg>
<seg id="63">"presumably because there were no prominent Americans so far, who in these revelations came forward with this scandal."</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not that there are no rich Americans hiding their fortunes in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">"but by the principle behind which these tax havens work, Mosul Fonseca has less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, in some US states, less information is needed, less information must be given to establish a firm than to get a library card."</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to pick up school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">Scammers have allowed scammers to rip off especially vulnerable cuttings.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it actually work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator to the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigator gave himself up as an African minister who wanted to bring about suspicious money to the United States to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">It really shocked us that all up to one lawyer made suggestions on how to transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">"none of these lawyers took us as a client, and of course no one was given money to anyone. but it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as an individual case.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who submitted proposals to our covert investigators.</seg>
<seg id="79">"it is not about a single leader politician, involved in a scandal."</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and to cope with this, we have to change the rules of the game."</seg>
<seg id="82">We have to change the rules to complicate this kind of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">"this may sound very bumptuous, as if we could do nothing against it; as if nothing ever changed; as if there will always be the rich and powerful."</seg>
<seg id="84">"but as a borrowed optimist, I see quite a lot of things started to change."</seg>
<seg id="85">"over the past few years, we have seen incidents of more transparency regarding the owners of companies."</seg>
<seg id="86">The theme was political attention given by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU has been gathering in central registers at national level, who really is behind companies in Europe, and who controls it."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have introduced a draft bill in both parliamentary chambers, but this does not make the progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who become angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind fake companies.</seg>
<seg id="93">We need managers in the business who get up and say: "transparency is not good for business."</seg>
<seg id="94">We need leading politicians who recognise the problem and are committed to ending laws on this kind of intransparency.</seg>
<seg id="95">"together we can finally end the intransparency which now allows this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story of how I was almost abducted and landed in the trunk of a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">"one day after I finished my design studies, I made a shop selling."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my belongings.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country. afterwards he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he excitedly told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I got tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"as we paid the bill, I made the mistake asking him," "Where do you sleep tonight?" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing even worse: "I don't know yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought," Oh, man! "</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just got to know him! he says he would go to the peace corps, but I don't know if he really plans it. I don't want to land in the trunk of a Mazdas!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard: "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"a voice in my head said," "How do you please?" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night I was lying in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought," Oh man! what did I rock into it? "</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild stranger sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he's mad?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such a fear that I stepped out of the bed, sliding at toe tips to the door, and closed my bedroom door."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art he bought from me hangs today in his classrooms. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it changed my point of view completely.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood were friends who were only waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">"to accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress."</seg>
<seg id="123">"let's make a time jump, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I am unemployed, almost bankrupt, my roommate leaves and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">"I think creativity can create it, to transform fear into fun."</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky:" Brian, I thought about how we could make something about it. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can sleep with us, Wi-Fi and a desk, including a mattress and breakfast each morning. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded so "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRB aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">"they found it super, and we too."</seg>
<seg id="132">I am sure our cheese ham omelets tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we toured with them throughout the city. when we passed our last guest and dropped the door into the castle, Brian and I stared."</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate, Nate Bleusczyk, joined us as a developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out whether you could make a business concept out of it.</seg>
<seg id="138">"we presented to investors:" we want to create a website on which people post pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the type of room whose doors one closes when visiting. "</seg>
<seg id="139">"over the internet, they can then invite strangers to stay with them."</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the missile to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">"indeed, they are not."</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still in comfort would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children we all learned that foreigners are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if you have a problem, you look at things that you can do well. we could design."</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Arts we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">"we had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, between people who had never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design make something like that?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample of which degree of trust we aspire to.</seg>
<seg id="152">It's a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your unlocked mobile phone from your left wing neighbour.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet approach to panic that you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">The only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, they will see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked mobile of a stranger in his hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">"in this way, most guests feel comfortable when they stay somewhere else."</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason can our company exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">"just like that, who actually has Al Gores mobile phone now?"</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please tell on Twitter that he is running for the office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you of some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a small detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbor had first presented himself with his name; if he had told, where did he come from, how his dog or his children are called?"</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 judgements that all say: "he can really hold very well sprung mobile phones!</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to hand off your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">"for a well thought out feedback system, trust is crucial."</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for people to give negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">"finally, we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had submitted their assessments before we put them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how probable it is that people trust each other, depending on how much they are about age and residence."</seg>
<seg id="178">"little surprisingly, we trust the most similar to the people who are most similar to us."</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting when you add a person's call -- in our case by assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">"if you have less than three convictions, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but if you have more than ten, everything changes."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation came out of common ground.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted passion.</seg>
<seg id="186">"in addition, we learned that trust depends on how much you are price."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if you tell too little, such as" Hi!, "you don't get an answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"one tells too much, for example:" I have problems with my mother "-- -- the request is not accepted."</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal degree of openness, such as" Tolle artworks in your apartment! I make a holiday with my family. "</seg>
<seg id="191">How can you create it with design to create this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which subjects to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to abandon these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take advantage of our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">"first, incredibly good luck."</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">"thirdly, a need that had not been met before."</seg>
<seg id="200">"for us, the business is running very well."</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not everything runs smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have not allowed parties to party or have devastated apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front line when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts if I just think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment we hear in the voice of the caller was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, the 123 million spent overnight stays only a fraction of the problem."</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trusted each other rightly.</seg>
<seg id="210">"when trust works, wonderful things can arise."</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">Perfect home for travelers who tend to heart attacks due to sedentary activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save lives even though they don't know one.</seg>
<seg id="218">"you drive one in your own car to the hospital, when you die, and wait while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they don't want you to feel lonely, they pass books."</seg>
<seg id="220">They can stay even longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">"this way, of course, not every stay will expire."</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I stumbled over this term for the first time, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is a question of economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but now simply name" "rental industry", "the thing is not fair."</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">"people have a part of themselves open, and that changes everything."</seg>
<seg id="230">"it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">But what if journeys would be a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">"what if in any place you visit, a group of Answers would wait to fill a thoroughly and show one in a pub-pentine neighborhood of which one has never heard before;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">"today, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy."</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would create apartments from the ground up to share?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would assume the idea of sharing their share?</seg>
<seg id="238">"I imagine cities which enable society and relationships, instead of loneliness and shut-off."</seg>
<seg id="239">"in South Korea capital Seoul, this project has already been started. many parking spaces that belonged to the government,"</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered residents. students looking for a place to stay</seg>
<seg id="241">"were imparted to people whose children had moved out. incubator programs were launched,"</seg>
<seg id="242">"to finance new start-ups in the Share economy. over our platform alone, 785,000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a foreign or even host."</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea doesn't seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">"there was a warm welcome, too."</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why exactly did ours work?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from luck and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">"I find it amazing,"</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda goes past me.</seg>
<seg id="253">Of course we know that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use design soon."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"or suppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">This is how the media portray people that look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study found that 80% of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">"studies show that Americans mean, most would not know Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">"for all those who have never met a Muslim, it's great to get to know you."</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">"I am introverted,"</seg>
<seg id="271">"a Möchtegern-Fitness-Fanatiker,"</seg>
<seg id="272">"and I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born that way."</seg>
<seg id="274">I made a decision.</seg>
<seg id="275">"when I was 17 years old, I decided to outen."</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as Muslims. I decided to wear hijab, my head cover."</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist friends were horrified: "why do you suppress yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">"the funny thing was: at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence, and compared to the pressure I felt as a 17-year-old, I had to adapt to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only passively accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have wrestled with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, thought, turned into question, doubted and ultimately believed."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">She was confident and slow dedication that deepened with every reading of the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of rhythm sometimes brings me to tears.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">"have you ever felt that someone perceives you, fully understands you, and yet loves somehow?"</seg>
<seg id="287">That's how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">"later I got married and started, like all the good Egyptians, my career as an engineer."</seg>
<seg id="289">"later, after my marriage, I had a child, and basically lived the" Egyptian-American Dream. ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came that terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast at the end, looked at the screen and saw the word" breaking news. ""</seg>
<seg id="293">"there was smoke, planes flew into buildings, people jumped out of the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disturbance?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock quickly turned into outrage.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should I do such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I changed the TV channel and heard:"... "Muslim terrorists..."... "in the name of Islam..."... "... jihad...,..."... "Jihad bombed Mecca!"</seg>
<seg id="300">"Oh, my God."</seg>
<seg id="301">"not only has it been attacked by my country, but in the Nu the actions of others transformed me into a suspect."</seg>
<seg id="302">"on the same day, we had to travel through the Midwest of the US to go to a new city and start the postgraduate course."</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember how I drove -- as we drove in silence -- as deep as I was chewing in my seat, and I was the first time I was afraid to be recognized as Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="304">"we moved into our apartment this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said:" be vigilant, "" Be careful, "" Stay in well lit areas, "" Don't cripple. "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed in the whole week.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then there was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warnings answered:" "do not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a destination."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive reporting.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were understandably unfiltered, and I also heard from attacks on Muslims or from people that were held for Muslims, dragged and struck free."</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked this country attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have got rid of the anger of the people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I have nothing against questions, I love questions."</seg>
<seg id="319">They are the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Nowadays we can actually say people say: "there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we get rid of them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church as a tumor in the US body.</seg>
<seg id="324">Only the question arises: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumour is removed as a whole and a benign tumor is maintained only under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">"like all other Americans, Muslims are not a tumour in the body of the United States, but a vital organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">"Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responderers and Olympians."</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of Mosques America make safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">"there may be a few parking spaces, but not to stop the terror."</seg>
<seg id="332">Regular visiting a mosque causes people to be tolerant of other faiths and to show greater civic participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as a head of the police in the Washington DC area, DC recently told me: people are actually not radicalized in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalized in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"in the process of radicalisation, it has been established that it begins online. first, the person is cut off from their community, even from their family, so that the extremists of people believe that terrorists are the real Muslims, and anyone who abhors their behavior and ideology is a traitor or of faith."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalisation, we must stop people from going to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"as a Muslim, as a mother, as a human being, I believe we must do everything to stop a group like the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imaginations if they recognize them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux-Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology on their "holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but if you take a look at them, they do not drive what they read in their" Holy Scripture. ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things in scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she preferred to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said the problem was just the opposite. every priest with whom she spoke brought her to silence, telling her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would bring them into trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"inspired by nothing and something that gave sense to their anger, it was a major goal for the instrumentalization through extremists that promised her a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam brought the connection to God and her church.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of accusing them of their anger, he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">"what she learned in the mosque, she kept going to join the IS."</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">"how does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?"</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually several neurological studies -- show: if we fear we pass at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">"we accept rather an authoritarian system of government, conformity and prejudice."</seg>
<seg id="360">"a study shows: when people submit messages that have been reported negatively about Muslims, they are more likely to agree with military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"if you look at the mood against Muslims from above -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in the context of terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">"so Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction of Muslim terror, as I expected."</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a manipulator to manipulate the public in order to undermine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">"we may feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear hurts all of us."</seg>
<seg id="368">"in the case of the assignment of collective guilt, it is not only about having to explain itself."</seg>
<seg id="369">"Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple living in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school."</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="371">"he was at the dental faculty, talented, promising..."</seg>
<seg id="372">"his sister would say to me that he was the sweetest, most generous person she knew."</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was amazed and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "when has I become such a savage young man from my brother?" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">"just a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne with her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, killed her, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who visited her in the afternoon."</seg>

<seg id="377">"fanaticism can be not only immoral, but also deadly."</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the start.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or did we stay safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about what America we want to leave to our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can freely exercise our religion."</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the child seat we drove in silence, with high pressure to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took him out, drew my shoes, went to the prayer hall, and what I saw let me stop."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half the assemblies were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who had come not to attack us, but to assist us."</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment I collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had brought courage and compassion to panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose at the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Are you going to be safe?</seg>
<seg id="392">"or will you join those who think," "We are better than those." ""</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia you seem to have hit a nerve.</seg>

<seg id="407">What began as a platform for hobbyists is about to become a billiard business.</seg>
<seg id="408">"control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research institutions around the world."</seg>
<seg id="409">"before air package delivery into our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines at the FRAC Centre in France has built a six metre high tower of 1 500 bricks live in front of the audience."</seg>
<seg id="410">"by connecting flights, aircraft achieve high speed and acceleration in confined spaces."</seg>
<seg id="411">They can also build up-to-themselves turn-resistant structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">"they have learned to carry loads, deal with turbulence and generally react to laws of nature."</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we want to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to transcend the limits of possibility in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"in order for a system to operate autonomously, it is necessary to know collectively where the mobile objects are located in the room."</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos we use a new localization technology of Verity Studios, an offshoot of our laboratory."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">"each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, determine calculations on board what the machine should do."</seg>
<seg id="420">"external commands exist on the highest level e. g." "Start" "and" "land". ""</seg>
<seg id="421">"this is a so-called tail-starter,"</seg>
<seg id="422">A flight device that tries to beat two birds with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">"like other starters, it is efficient in forward flying, much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"in contrast to most startup cursors, it can fluctuate and thus has great advantages at start and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a downside."</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of hedge-starters is that they react sensitively to turmoil like wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">"the idea behind it is that the flight device, no matter in which position, recovers the optimal position and the performance can be improved by practicing."</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions, which advance to the core of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">"such a question would be, for example, what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?"</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">"helicopters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts, which meet to hurt you."</seg>
<seg id="434">"decades ago, trained pilots were able to fly remote-controlled aircraft, which had only two moving parts: a propeller and a stern rudder."</seg>
<seg id="435">"recently, we discovered that flying with only one thing worked."</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the monospinner, the mechanically simplest remote-operated flight device. it was invented recently."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only a movable part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no clapping, hinges and cross rudder, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanically simple, very much happens inside the interior, so that it can fly stable, and move anywhere in the room."</seg>
<seg id="440">"nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the tail-starters. to bring it to flying, I have to throw it right."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the likelihood of throwing it right, if you all see me is low, so I'll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening."</seg>
<seg id="442">"if the monospinner is an exercise in cruelty, this machine is here, the bus with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why he is ambivalent in his alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">"thus, he receives the extraordinary ability,"</seg>
<seg id="447">"move in the room in all directions, no matter in which direction it is rotated or even rotated."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight propellers."</seg>
<seg id="449">"a lot is imaginable in models, the rest is learned directly when flying."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's look at this.</seg>
<seg id="451">"when flying machines are to be part of everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate two-propeller machines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other counter-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">"when one builds them together, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter."</seg>
<seg id="456">"but if something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller fails, the electronics or a battery - the machine can still fly, even if limited."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate this by making half flightless.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration uses synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">We took commercially available micro-quadcopters -- every single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where space it is and is self-controlled. that is why there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully these demonstrations motivate you to think out new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">"on Broadway, the particularly safe machine would like to be a flying lampshade."</seg>
<seg id="464">"of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology."</seg>
<seg id="465">"for types like us, wages are in development and creative act."</seg>
<seg id="466">"it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures to form them in such a spectacular way."</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">"1.3 billion years ago, two black holes surrounded each other in a very far distant galaxy; they converted the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second into pure energy."</seg>
<seg id="470">For this short moment they illuminated brighter than all stars together in all galaxies of the entire universe known to us.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not set up their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into space-time structure itself and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us first arrange the events in the event of time.</seg>
<seg id="476">"1.3 billion years ago, a multi-cell life was created on Earth."</seg>
<seg id="477">"since then the earth has brought forth a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and -- God is at us -- even the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="478">"about 25 years ago, a group of particularly bold -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever decided to build a huge laser detector from Caltech -- to search for gravitational-waves, which originate from colliding black holes."</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them thought they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">"but enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses, so that the US National Science Foundation financed her idea."</seg>
<seg id="481">"after decades of development, design, design and extremely hard work they built the detector Ligo: the laser-interferometer- gravitational-waves observatory."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the following period, the precision of Ligo could be considerably increased, which greatly improved the recognition performance."</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">"at the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a last test run to clarify some minor, persistent problems."</seg>
<seg id="485">"on September 14, 2015, only a few days after the commissioning of the detector, the gravitational waves of the two colliding black holes chapped through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="486">You went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell from my father-to-death father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically it was the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">"AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has studied gravitational waves of black holes for 23 years and their observatories like Ligo measurable signals. but what are gravitational-waves?"</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a crow in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"when moving the shaft, the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and stout into the other."</seg>
<seg id="495">"for illustrative purposes, lecturers in courses on the theory of relativity often lead to a really old dance."</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dusting, stretching and dusting."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational-waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on September 14th, for example, each of us was stretched and quaked at the arrival of the waves. the elongation of an average person was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"that is 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five-kilometre-long laser detector, and this is already absurd, this length would have to be measured in less than one thousandth of the radius of a nuclear nucleus. this is grotesque."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravity</seg>
<seg id="502">"Kip Thorne, a co-founder Ligos, described the hunt for the waves as follows:" technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous. "</seg>
<seg id="503">"but physicists are inventive and with the support of the public, all obstacles will be overcome."</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott likes to say Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than things around us: facial features, the size of your cell."</seg>
<seg id="508">"this is quite practical, because so you can make a picture or a map of things by perceiving the light coming around you from several points."</seg>
<seg id="509">"in sounds, it is different."</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"that is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that are particularly important to you:"</seg>
<seg id="512">Take care of your child's face.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead, we listen to certain properties such as pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume to close the story behind."</seg>
<seg id="514">"now, just Alice speaks."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"dummer Bob,"</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot make simple pictures of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by watching changes in the amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">"so, when we convert wave patterns in sound, we can literally hear the universe."</seg>
<seg id="522">"to listen to the gravity can tell us about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been busy for quite a long time."</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, not rotating holes, just run: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">"turn the two bodies very quickly, you can hear the same chirping with an additional key change. this sounds like Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!"</seg>
<seg id="525">"it is a type of movement vocabulary, imprinted in the waveform."</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Ligo heard the following: [Surrender noise] Anyone who knows what he has to hear, sees this as a noise of -- SH:... two black holes with 30-fold solar mass, which rotate around as fast as the bars of your shaker."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, circling a hundred times a second before colliding."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know of it because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the remaining meaning of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo opens up a completely new way to explore the universe as it has never been possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this path we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space we can -- practically or fundamentally -- not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">"a supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in supernovas."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we have learned a lot about them all.</seg>
<seg id="538">"the exciting physical processes happen, however, in the core hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through as these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gravitational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would love to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see them as the Big Bang is covered by its own afterglow."</seg>
<seg id="541">Using gravitational-waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">"the most important thing: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, which we will never see, and which we have no idea of. things that we only discover by listening."</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, Ligo found things right in the first attempt that we didn't expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says to this topic: me: the kind of stars that highlight black holes, like Ligo they observe, are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"they are enormous, age-old bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are, so to speak, the dinosaur bones for our archaeological work."</seg>
<seg id="546">"Ligo gives us a completely different view of the events in space, to the emergence of the stars and ultimately to how we came out of this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now is to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">"thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the roaring and chirping of the cosmos."</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">Because what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big Bang?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">"some time ago, I tried out an experiment."</seg>
<seg id="555">"for one year, I would say" yes! "I was afraid of."</seg>
<seg id="556">"no matter whether it made me nervous, brought me into unpleasant situations, I forced myself to say" "yes". ""</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">"no, but yes!"</seg>

<seg id="560">"no, but yes!"</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start playing?</seg>
<seg id="562">"no, no, no, but yes, yes, yes."</seg>
<seg id="563">"and a crazy thing happened: exactly what I was afraid to do, I removed my fear."</seg>
<seg id="564">"my fear of keeping speeches, my social anxiety -- puff, away."</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes" has changed my life.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">"but there was a certain Yes, which changed my life deeply, on an unexpected way. it started with a question of my little ones."</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson."</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she were a waitress from the South.</seg>
<seg id="571">"kittens, I need milk for my beak-cup."</seg>
<seg id="572">"she asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"a new attitude towards life in my family. from then on, I am wasting to always play with them once you ask me. no matter what I'm doing or where I go, I always say Yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">"almost. I'm not perfect, but I'm very tired."</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, on my children, on our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">"but it also has a startling side effect: only recently I really understood that the" "yes" "to play with my children saved my career."</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">"I am a writer. I think things out, wake up to life."</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No. no.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I screamed TV. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">"I do TV, in a big style."</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for taking 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">"four TV programmes, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production."</seg>
<seg id="588">Each shipment has hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV station can lie between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"a new episode every nine days four shows, so all nine days 20 million dollars television, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three programmes simultaneously in production four, 16 episodes: slimming, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours TV,"</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series run one after another on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">"all over the world, my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers."</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are programmes that I have created myself, and not only produced, so on top of it. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfires burning around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who still does it?</seg>
<seg id="598">"no one, that's why I am a Titan."</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with this.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think when the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">"I tell you so that all of you who are working so hard, whether you are running a company, a country or a classroom, take me seriously if I speak of work, so you understand that I'm not just around the computer and fancier, and it's true when I say: I don't understand it's going to dream with a dream job."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it's all a job, all work, everything reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I work a lot, hard, and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"when I am immersed in the work, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">"it is as if I set up troops, as I painted on a canvas."</seg>
<seg id="608">"as a result of a high sound, a marathon ran."</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love working.</seg>
<seg id="612">"she is creative, mechanically, tiring and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and sensible."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work goes well.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a swamp starts in my head, and it grows and grows, and the humming sounds like a busy street, I could always drive on it."</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people participate when I explain to them the humming that I am talking about writing that writing gives me joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">"don't understand me wrong, it does it."</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the sums -- when I began to work and work, to work and to work, to create, create and collaborate, I discovered this thing, this sum, this energy."</seg>
<seg id="618">The sum is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The Summa is action and activity. the Summa is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The buzz is music. the humming is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The Summon is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a sum, then you cannot strive for size."</seg>
<seg id="623">"feeling not to be different than to strive for size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the Summa.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it also means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it's called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it's called the ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I just know that I'm not made for failure, and I just know I love the sums."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I just want to tell you, I am a Titan, and I know I don't want to question it."</seg>
<seg id="632">"the more successful I become, the more episodes the more episodes, the more work there are, the more things happen at the same time, the more I write history, the more expectations are there."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to be successful, the more I have to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love work, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the country I create, the marathon, which I run, the army, the screen, the high clay, the sums, the sums, the sums."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sum. I love the humming.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sum.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this humming?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the swamp stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">"overhauled, overloaded, overhauled, burned out."</seg>
<seg id="642">The swamp stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are used to the truth that her mommy is a single institute.</seg>
<seg id="644">"Harper tells people:" my mum won't be there, but you can write to my Nanny. "</seg>
<seg id="645">"and Emerson says:" "kitten, I want to go to Shonda land."</seg>
<seg id="646">They are the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are Baby-Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1 when the sums were stopped."</seg>
<seg id="649">The humming of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my job any more. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My swamp was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I did the same things as usual: the same Titans work, 15 hours-days, worked weekends, no regrets, nothing delegate, a titanium does not sleep, does not give up, with whole heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no humming.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">"I was a showcase Titan,"</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was grey, I just had no more fun."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the humming and the humming I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what do you do if what you do, the work you love suddenly fade away?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know some may think:" howl, stupid author Titan. "</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know you do it, you do it, you love what you do, be a teacher, be a banker, a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love another and that gives one the buzz when you know the swamp, who is you?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"when the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">"and then my" "southern state waitress" "asks me a question."</seg>
<seg id="672">"I am on the way to the outside, late in it and she says," "Mum, do you like to play?"</seg>
<seg id="673">And I don't want to say no more than two things can be made aware of:</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I have to say yes to everything and secondly, she didn't call me" "kitten." ""</seg>
<seg id="675">"she does not call anyone" "kittens". ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When did that happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I miss it when I'm Titan and my swamp smokes, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says," "Mum, do you like to play?"</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about that.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and her sisters meet, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" Everybody Poops. ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding, because my pain and panic, loneliness and lack of money, I can't do anything except to watch out."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the country I create, the marathon, which I run, the army, the screen, the high clay - they no longer exist."</seg>
<seg id="687">"everything that exists are sticky fingers and wet kisses, delicate voices, waxing pencils and the song in which it goes without letting go, or whatever the girl in" The Ice Queen "lets go."</seg>
<seg id="688">Peace and simplicity everywhere are everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so short that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes on and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and this does not happen immediately, but it happens."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The humming slowly returns.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, hardly there, it's quiet, barely audible, but it's there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the sum, but a sum."</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I would know a magical secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. just love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something that we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the sums, the sums of work, the sums of title, that is only the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, if I describe me with the help of broadcasts and television hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real sum is."</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums are not force and it is not labour-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sum is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The buzzing is the current that comes from the zest of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real humming is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"the real sum ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be accomplished, the expectation and the pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real swamp is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"the real swamp is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered to me the wrong words, for what God told me that I am a Titan?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is simply love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a bit more love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"as soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">"I make this a fixed rule, so that I can free myself from any blame as a workaholic."</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is law, I have no other choice. I have no other choice if I want to hear the sums again."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">"playing is not enough to me, as we work."</seg>
<seg id="722">"the truth hurts,"</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer working at the workplace than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this admission is painful, because what kind of person prefers to be rather than home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well, I."</seg>
<seg id="728">"honestly, I call myself" Titan. ""</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">"that I am too relaxed, none of them."</seg>
<seg id="731">"we rattle in the garden, before and back, back and forth."</seg>
<seg id="732">"we make small dance parties,"</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We shatter soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">"in doing so, I mostly feel stiff, absent and confused."</seg>
<seg id="736">I always take care of my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how to live, and the humming of the universe fills me."</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why did we stop playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also do it! always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">"perhaps you consider me naïve, for a daydreamer."</seg>
<seg id="742">"you're right, but you can do it too!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">"my little ones want to play with me at the most 15 minutes, until they think they want to do something different."</seg>
<seg id="748">"it is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a Marienkäfer or cookie replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">"and when my teenage daughter talks to me for about 15 minutes, I am the mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"it is only 15 minutes, there is no need for it."</seg>
<seg id="752">"everyone can spend 15 minutes on the track, even on a bad mood!"</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes on the piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction."</seg>
<seg id="755">"the day is short: dinner, the children are getting ready for bed."</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in it!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my well-being, my world. they don't have to be the children. it is important to feel the humming, to have a place for peace of mind."</seg>
<seg id="758">"it's not about playing with your own children. it's about pleasure,"</seg>
<seg id="759">"in order to" "play" "in general."</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you are doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and keep it up.</seg>
<seg id="763">"I'm not perfect in it. I fail and I win. friends meet, read books, enjoy the day --"</seg>
<seg id="764">"" "do you want to play?" "is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in training when I wanted to surpass myself more and more."</seg>
<seg id="765">"15 minutes on the track, why not take full 15 minutes?"</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The swamp came back in my free time. the swamp seems to return when I don't work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy pours in and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul."</seg>
<seg id="770">"I like the sums, but I don't love it."</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">"I am not the sum, the sum is not me... no more."</seg>
<seg id="773">"soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends."</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my totality.</seg>
<seg id="775">The totality of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The totality of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">"the sum of the work is part of me, but just a part. and I am so grateful for that."</seg>
<seg id="778">It's gonna be that I am a Titan. I have never seen a Titan who is going on a trip to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still working. my campfire is still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">"the more I play, the happier I and my children."</seg>
<seg id="782">"the more I play, the more I feel as a good mother."</seg>
<seg id="783">"the more I play, the clearer my head is."</seg>
<seg id="784">"the more I play, the better I work."</seg>
<seg id="785">"the more I play, the more I hear the sums. the country I create, the marathon, which I run, the troops, the screens, the high clay, the sums, the sums, the other, the right sums: the sum of life."</seg>
<seg id="786">"the more I feel this total, the more this unusual, consistent, naked and new feeling of life spreads in me. less Titan -- more I!"</seg>
<seg id="787">"the more I feel this total, the more I know who I am."</seg>
<seg id="788">"I am a writer. I think things out, I wake you up to life."</seg>
<seg id="789">"this is part of the job, which means living your dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">"this is the dream of this job,"</seg>
<seg id="791">For a dream job should be a bit dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">"I said" "Yes" "to less work and more games."</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to the other after a heavy stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgeons, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nervous functions through various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">"they certainly have heard of one of the most known, the" deep brain stimulation. "in doing so, one conducts an electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits of the neurons so that the neurological function is improved."</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease who suffered severe tremors and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">"neuromodulation, however, does not mean neuro-healing."</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeon is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At that time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I supplied patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You have to imagine that in skull-brain trauma the brain swells and the cranial pressure increases.</seg>
<seg id="815">"in order to save life, it is necessary to reduce cranial pressure."</seg>
<seg id="816">"for this, sometimes a part of swollen brain mass must be removed."</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse the mass of the brain with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">To grow cells from a tissue is comparable to very small children who are taken out of their families.</seg>
<seg id="822">"it is necessary to find proper nutrition, temperature, humidity and environments to flourish."</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">"after many attempts, Jean-François succeeded."</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw that under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells, surrounded by small, unmature cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">"perhaps you still know from biology classes, that stem cells are immature cells that can transform into every cell type of the organism."</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operating room.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they divide very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They split slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells, but behaved differently."</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doubleman-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our cerebral cortex cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the foetus stage they provide for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay with us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations near brain injuries."</seg>
<seg id="847">"however, this is not so certain."</seg>
<seg id="848">"one thing, however, is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells."</seg>
<seg id="849">"we are facing a potential cell source, enabling brain healing."</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells in exactly the same way as Jean-François did.</seg>
<seg id="853">And they then color their color in order to be able to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">"in the final step, we re-planted them at the resolution of the same individual."</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we re-implant these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we re-implant the same cells into damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">"thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with apes."</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario we re-planted the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they had been removed, they go back home."</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we perfected an injury and re-planted exactly the same cells and now the cells remained - they grew to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we were able to observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been re-planted.</seg>
<seg id="862">"the evidence they show are these little points. these are the cells that we in vitro, dye in culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">"of course, we could not stop here."</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained apes with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take feed pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They did it very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">"when they reached a stable level of skill, we injured the motor motor sector in the motor cortex."</seg>
<seg id="869">"then the monkeys were paralysed, they couldn't move their hand any more."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it would happen to people, they spontaneously recovering up to a certain degree, just as after a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralysed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">"on the left hand side, they see the monkey who spontaneously recovered."</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from before injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"see now, when we re-planted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the implantation."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were very exciting results for us too.</seg>
<seg id="878">"since that time, we have found out much more about these cells."</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and use them later.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use it in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease."</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to impldate it with people.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">"Luigi Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that right now, several dozen people in the audience, perhaps even the majority, think:" I know someone who can need it. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely do.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials on humans."</seg>
<seg id="887">"Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results, you have to fill two kilograms of paper and forms to go through this type of studies."</seg>
<seg id="888">"BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc."</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">"BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it takes until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available."</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: it's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first, it depends on the approval of the clinical study."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this type of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">"after that, it is necessary to apply this to a multicenter study."</seg>
<seg id="897">First you really have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">"BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course."</seg>
<seg id="899">"BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and told us about it."</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to look at them as self-evident.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we don't see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is, but as an inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to look at her as an immutable fact.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">"Lee Kuan Yev from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing have proved without doubt that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy is dwindling with us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unequivocally clear to me as a finance minister in the Eurogroup -- that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- could not influence the austerity programs implemented in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at that moment I thought there might be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my budding friends who told me repeatedly that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">"at this point, I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy."</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup are mistaken, we could save democracy, but that we need a truthful and defenceless democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"without democracy, our societies are becoming more bleak, our future bleak, and our great new technologies are wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the subject of waste, I would like to remind you of an interesting contradiction that currently threatens our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "Twin-Summit-Paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">"a top is known to you. you know and recognize it as the mountain of debt, which casts its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all recognize the mountain of debt,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But only a few recognize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash, which is one of the wealthier economists and corporations, who, however, are too fearful to invest there where it would be productive and contribute to the production of all the things that humanity desperately needs, for example" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"in the past 3 months, in the United States, England and the eurozone, 3.4 billion US dollars were invested in all the wealth of producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so on."</seg>
<seg id="922">"$3.4 trillion credits after much money until one compares it to the $5.1 trillion US dollar, which at the same time circulated in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing to inflate except the stock exchanges and raise the real estate prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus, debts and unproductive capital form the twin summit which cannot be compensated by the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result is stagnant wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the US, Japan and Europe unemployed, and consequently a low overall economic demand which, as in a final loop, feared the pessimism of investors, in which they would not invest in which they would not invest."</seg>
<seg id="925">Inadvertently bring about the circumstances leading to killing Oedipus.</seg>
<seg id="926">That is my hatred with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, to further develop human talents and to finance especially all the technologies," green "technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">So is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">"but before we continue, what do we mean by democracy?"</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the social form in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">"of course, the Athenian democracy included too many."</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be a mistake to mitigate the significance of the Athenian democracy on account of these exclusions."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decisive factor in the Athenian democracy was and is that it received the working arms, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, that they admitted the right to political participation with the same voice weighting in questions of the state of the state."</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy did not last long --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle, which illuminates very brightly, it is also quickly burned out."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our liberal democracies do not have their roots in ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the Athenian democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthening the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for ruling classes."</seg>
<seg id="940">"the liberal democracy first arose when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was confined to politics, while the economy -- that is, the world of corporations -- became a democratized zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in our democracies, since the time when this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle took place between the two by gradually undermining politics and emitted them."</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It does not lie on a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is because today it is possible to be in the government, and yet not in power, because the power is immigrated from politics into the economy and the areas are separated."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hatred with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"if you think about it, it is like a herd of carnivores, which so sustainably has decimated the animals of which they nourish themselves, that they are starving at the end."</seg>
<seg id="947">"it is similar to the economy that has harmed politics so far that it harms itself through the self-caused economic crisis itself. the power of the corporations is growing, political goods are being depreciated, the inequality grows, the general economic demand falls and the corporate managers are too scared to invest in the cash of their companies."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful capitalism drives the" demos "of democracy, the higher the twin-summit, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of mankind."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if this is true, it is obvious that we must bring back politics and the economy and it would be better if the" demos "keep control, as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">"by the way, this is not a new idea."</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist Left had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine of the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new types of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: to abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by substituting low wage workers by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twins higher, the waste becomes more sublime, and social conflicts are deeper, as I believe -- in countries like China."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so we have to redesign the economy and reunite the business and politics sectors, and ensure that we are democratizing the re-united area, otherwise we end up in a diseased surveillance hyperautocracy, which makes the film" matrix "as a documentary."</seg>
<seg id="957">"the question is, therefore, not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has produced."</seg>
<seg id="958">"the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to that in" Matrix, "or something similar to that of society in" Star Trek, "or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athener" Agora, "indulging in long talks to the meaning of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">"so what would it look like, how could it look like this" Star Trek "-like utopia instead of the" Matrix "-similar dystopia?"</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the area of companies: please introduce a capital market where you earn money while working and in which your capital is following you from one office to the next, and the company -- no matter what you are working at -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">"then all income comes from capital and revenue, and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction between those who belong to the companies but who do not work in it, and employees who work there, but the company does not belong to them. no exchange between capital and labour, no large gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no lifting twin tops."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the sphere of global political economy: please introduce briefly that our national currencies would have issued a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund] and the G-20 [group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interests of all humanity."</seg>
<seg id="966">"imagine that all world trade is traded in this currency - call it" the cosmos, "in units of" cosmos "-- and every government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country, into a common fund."</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that this fund invests in" green "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to put it into practice.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today, we have them, in particular against the background of a reunified policy and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world I describe is at the same time a volunteer in which it prefers privileged people, and Marxist, because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the garbage of history, and Keynesian, global Keynesian."</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all else it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we awaken in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">"it is in our hands, and we do it better democratically."</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Fr. Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography as liberal Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">"Yanis Varoufakis: if anything of what I have just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant."</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for the reunification of politics and business is... Do we not do that, technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand, what Larry Summers calls for" long-term stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next, as we currently experience, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant,"</seg>
<seg id="986">"like Hayek, therefore I am a liberal Marxist, and like Keynes, and that is why I am also perfect."</seg>
<seg id="987">"BG: actually, and now we are well."</seg>
<seg id="988">"YV: if you're not stupid, you don't think enough."</seg>
<seg id="989">"BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said that. BG: in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have clearly said what you think of the West's view on China."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the appearance of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my talk, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of it is playing -- the sphere of economics -- is a fully democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in some respects, if I may say so provocative, China is similar to that of England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">"for -- remember -- we tend to link liberalism with democracy -- this is a mistake, historically considered."</seg>
<seg id="996">"liberalism, Liberals, like John Stuart Mill --"</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">"what we can observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"China is now proposing to do what the West has done in the nineteenth century, smells of hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners were curious about their experience as Greek Finance Minister at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I suspected that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later in the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the Eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"namely to say good-bye to complacency, and the constant denial that a massive dearming line passed through the Eurozone, and continues to massively threaten the development of the whole European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity to come on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which, by the way, was the first suggestion that revealed this denial --"</seg>
<seg id="1008">"unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the European Group, continued to denounce the denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if you try to get an economic system that is not viable, by political will and authoritarianism, you might be able to delay it for a while, but when the change occurs it happens abruptly and destructive."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you see ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as a finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- Ernst...</seg>
<seg id="1017">"if there is a finance minister or any minister who is in office after 6 months, especially in such a tense situation, he has made no mistake, then this is a dangerous person."</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest on the lenders of the lenders to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that wasn't.</seg>
<seg id="1022">"they merely wanted to bring our government, just because they did not want to deal with the distortions that were running through the Eurozone."</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to admit that they had been a catastrophic programme in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">It's worse than during the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">"none of the troika's troika, who imposed this policy on us, stood up:" that was a colossal mistake. "</seg>
<seg id="1027">"BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive tone of the talks, you seem to be quite pro-European."</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"" "my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe."</seg>
<seg id="1030">My biggest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">"for if they do not survive, the exposed centrifugal forces will be demonic and destroy the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1032">"this will not have catastrophic consequences for Europe alone, but for the entire global economy."</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">"if we allow ourselves to take the path of a post-modern 1930, after which it appears to me, it will be equally detrimental to the future of the Europeans as well as non-Europeans."</seg>

<seg id="1038">"of Roy Price most have never heard, although he probably is responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on April 19, 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">"probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for so many of you."</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">"Roy Price is the leading employee at Amazon Studios,"</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slim, has an Igelfrisur and refers to Twitter as" Movies, TV, Technology, Tacos. ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for choosing the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very hard-fought business."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are already so many TV shows that Roy cannot choose any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he has to find shows, which are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he has to find shows that are on the right corner of this curve."</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows will receive this review.</seg>
<seg id="1050">"if your show is valued at nine and above, it will be a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these are shows like" Breaking Bad, "" Game of Thrones, "" The Wire "-- all the shows that addicts where, after watching a season, your brain asks:" where are there more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left side, here at this end, shows like" Toddlers and Tiaras "-- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not worry about getting on the left side of the curve because I think you need special intelligence to accommodate "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he makes more thoughts about the average payout, the average TV -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't excite."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the pressure is there, and of course it's the first time that Amazon is doing such a thing, so Roy Price wants nothing to risk."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes many ideas for TV shows and selects eight Candidates for TV shows through an evaluation, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and presents them online, where everyone can watch them free of charge."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon publishes things for nothing, do you get up to it, right?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers watch these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they don't know they are watched when watching these shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"when you start the show, when you pause, which parts you skip or look at once again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they collect the data, process them and this results in the answer, and this is:" Amazon should make a sitcom about four Republican US senators. "</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," Alpha House, "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't that good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it's just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and alpha House landet at 7,5 -- so something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"at the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming Netflix. just like Roy he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it a little different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of organizing a competition, he and his team looked at the available data about the Netflix audience, so the reviews they give the shows their course, what shows they like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: which shows they like, what producers, what actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all the parts together they went into a venture and decided not to make a sitcom over four senators, but a drama series about a senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," "House of Cards". "Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons."</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9,1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted. "</seg>
<seg id="1080">"of course, the question is: what is happening here?"</seg>
<seg id="1081">"they have two very competitive, data sealed companies."</seg>
<seg id="1082">"they connect these many data to each other, and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company."</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is that?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow states that it should work in everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"if you collect millions of data, for a decision you meet, you should make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized through very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"the least thing you can expect is good television, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis does not work so, this is a little frightening because we live in a time when we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody know the multi-health system company?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"no one. OK, that's even good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">"multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one ever comes into contact with this software in this room. if you come into contact with it, you are in prison."</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if someone here in the U.S. is in prison and asks for release, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge occurs or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding if a show will be good or bad, it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"moderate television, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">"not always the best results are generated, which is not because a company such as Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data."</seg>
<seg id="1098">Also the data of the most experienced companies are wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"in 2009, Google announced that it can predict outbreaks of flu, the evil way, by analyzing the Google research through data analysis."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a big news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked flawlessly, year by year, until it suddenly stopped working,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it simply did not work, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the magazine" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data reversible companies like Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"despite all these errors, data stream rapidly into decisions of life -- at work, legal enforcement, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics - an area where some very smart people unimaginably use many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I have recognized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be disseminated.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"if you have to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"first, you disassemble this problem in its components so that you can analyze the individual parts; as a second, you put the items together again to make a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to dismantle a problem and to understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to reassemble the parts and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we all possess it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">"if there is something in which the brain is good, it's parts and pieces to compose again, even if the information is incomplete, in order to make a good decision - especially if it is the brain of an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"therefore, I think Netflix was so successful because they used data and intelligence, where they also belong in the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to better understand their audience, why they wouldn't have been able otherwise. but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like" "House of Cards" "was not in the data."</seg>
<seg id="1120">"Ted Sarandos and his team made this decision for this show, which meant they had a great personal risk with this decision."</seg>
<seg id="1121">"Amazon, on the other hand, did so in the wrong way."</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their decisions, first when competing for TV ideas, then selecting" "Alpha House" "as a show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">"it was a safe decision because they could always say:" "this is telling us the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data are helpful for better decisions, but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and to avoid this, this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before there was data, this was the device for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"it's also called" Magic 8 Ball. "it's amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or No-question, you only have to shake the ball to get an answer." most likely "-- right here at this moment."</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will challenge it later with a demo of technology.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"so far I have made some decisions in my life, whereby I should have listened to the ball in retrospect."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you naturally know, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them with something much more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"in the end it's up to us to make decisions, if we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right turn."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as a very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data still paying off, decisions are made to be an expert in what you are doing, and taking risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"at the end, it is not the data, but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
