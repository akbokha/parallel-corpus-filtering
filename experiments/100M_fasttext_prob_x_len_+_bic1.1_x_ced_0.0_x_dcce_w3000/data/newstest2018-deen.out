Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards that change your view of the city
an Irish institution where young people should meet today .
a chapel which is now dug for the S @-@ Bahn ( S @-@ Bahn ) tunnel .
gar@@ den@@ ers are cultiv@@ ating the ru@@ sty ground of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories .
it gets nervous when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everyone who had to get upset because the car navigation device was showing a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bayern @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ al Bavaria of the state government , are anything but current - but very revealing . &quot;
especially if you compare them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how towns and municipalities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Munich @-@ based Merk@@ ur since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work rug that one does not recognize as such .
&quot; in the large overview map , more detailed maps , so @-@ called &quot; &quot; rul@@ ings &quot; &quot; were incorporated for cities and municipalities . &quot;
these were created according to the Bavarian sur@@ veying business between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
&quot; Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographical survey of Bavaria , of course for military purposes . &quot;
&quot; even if the French troops finally removed the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on February 9 , 18@@ 01 , it was the neighbours of today who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria card . &quot;
&quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV Joseph drove the project forward , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bavarian sur@@ veying management . &quot;
the dial for Munich comes from the year 18@@ 56 and is to be found on the website of the Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek ( Bavarian State Library ) .
the comparison of early / Today is most impressive in the example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
&quot; an example of this is the sub@@ send@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 . &quot;
&quot; it was built 21 years after the map was created , thus in 18@@ 77 , as part of the Munich bor@@ ough . &quot;
&quot; today , the city is located in the middle of the city . &quot;
&quot; the houses of Unter@@ send@@ ling are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the present Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was first named after George Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : when zo@@ oming in appears a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ written numbered plots from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; primitive &quot; &quot; from which the basic tax was derived . &quot;
&quot; today , small plots of land don &apos;t show farmers anymore - but gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; Land in Sonne . &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ send@@ ling .
&quot; Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 the scene of the Oktober@@ fest , was in fact a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete fr@@ inge . &quot;
on the other hand of Is@@ ar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; in the area of today &apos;s district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; at the Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; or from the hill &quot; Auf der Lü@@ fte &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße one once closed people with del@@ u@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich @-@ based Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; Auf der Au@@ er Lü@@ fte &quot; &quot; was created there . &quot;
&quot; from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ den led the institution - that psychiat@@ rist , who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II . &quot;
&quot; he was progressive for his time , and , for example , ended the accus@@ ations of so @-@ called mad@@ men . &quot;
&quot; he also prohibited the personnel to use violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who worked for an exhibition with the institution . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients it was first place , later it was extended to 500 places . &quot;
&quot; at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Krei@@ se@@ r@@ ren@@ anstalt in the hair of 1905 . &quot;
&quot; since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um München @-@ Ost , one of the largest psy@@ chi@@ atri@@ ums in Germany , has been located there since 2006 . &quot;
young people meet in Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um in Munich on the grounds of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt .
the Order purchased the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with educational establishments .
&quot; West lies the football field of the TS@@ V Munich East , east of residential buildings from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was built - in architectural reference to the original construction of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , which was destroyed during the Second World War in bombing ra@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was registered as &quot; &quot; main square &quot; &quot; around 18@@ 56 , the Kauf@@ inger@@ straße was called &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Second World War brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
&quot; in December 1944 , the Al@@ lies bom@@ bed many holes in the inner city . &quot;
a big one remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
&quot; the English institute , small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages were once held at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days were the prepar@@ atory work and on 5 April 2017 the ground @-@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn track . &quot;
&quot; with the slider , you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof . &quot;
Om@@ bud@@ sman publishes travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the Promotion of Far@@ ms has issued a warning for coloured people who are travelling to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to discrimin@@ atory politics and rac@@ ist attacks .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which will enter into force by August 28 , 2017 , invites af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i to pay special attention when traveling through the state , as a number of question@@ able , rapid @-@ based occur@@ ren@@ ces occur recently throughout the state and noted here , &quot; says the Group &apos;s opinion . &quot;
&quot; a recently adopted law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes people harder to gain discrimination , as well as prosec@@ uting authorities of the state that dispro@@ portion@@ ate minorities , prompted the group to publish the warning message , said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot;
they have violations of the civil rights that people pass .
&quot; the president of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star , said , because of their skin colour . &quot;
we listen to complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet .
it is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States .
&quot; the group cited incidents such as rac@@ ist off@@ ences against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no longer any fuel during the journey and was taken into custody by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police without being accused of a crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council also points to a recent report by the Office of the At@@ tor@@ ney General of Mis@@ sour@@ i , in which it is shown that black mot@@ orists in the state will be 75 percent more likely to be considered whit@@ ew@@ ashed . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; says Chapel . &quot;
&quot; people need to be ready to bring money , or let the relatives know that they travel through the state . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 Mis@@ sour@@ i posted 100 hate crimes , according to the latest figures from the F@@ BI &apos;s hate crime program , which states the state with respect to the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country . &quot;
&quot; the warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law , which would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company for housing or employment discrimination . &quot;
&quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had issued warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states had adopted immigration laws that local law enforcement authorities ple@@ dge to arrest people due to immigration off@@ ences , which will contribute to further race profil@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries , but lately interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
electric fence project is elementary
the Fischer@@ bacher Wei@@ de@@ con@@ fence Project is a successful project and will be continued in the coming year .
the CD@@ U Par@@ liam@@ ent@@ arians Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have provided a picture on the spot .
&quot; at the v@@ aul@@ ted yard of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family , representatives of the f@@ isher &apos;s CD@@ U @-@ location meet together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann first gave insights into his farm , where he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of woods , supplies 40 milk cows and also many young animals and houses the holiday guests in five apartments . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Black Forest &quot; is the alternative marketing path for the milk of its cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
only Regi@@ on@@ ales arrive at the table of the holiday guests .
&quot; since he is also the BL@@ H@@ V president of Fischer@@ bach , he described the electric fence project as &quot; elementary important . &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t manage profit@@ ably on such steep areas .
&quot; the grass@@ land area care for a lot of work , much has to be processed with the br@@ ush@@ cutter . &quot;
&quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental operation and managed this without any chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if he did not conduct bio@@ cides . &quot;
&quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; the Commune has recognised the importance of the electric fence project and is happy about its leader support . &quot;
&quot; at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are , farmers would have to be supported . &quot;
I hope that the re@@ for@@ estation of the areas could be pulled out quite a while .
&quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they carry on their operation , &quot; &quot; said the Mayor . &quot;
farmers are often critici@@ zed for their support
&quot; in 2013 , a total of 25 par@@ c@@ els were fenced off by eleven participants . &quot;
&quot; the exhibition area is 40 hectares , which cannot be for@@ ested until at least 20@@ 23 . &quot;
&quot; half of the total cost of 71 500 Euro was supported by half of the leaders , one quarter contributed to the municipality of Fischer@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; thus , the farmers remained 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres of fence . &quot;
&quot; the big advantage is the durability of the f@@ ences , &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; you do a really good job without farmers and land@@ lords . &quot;
&quot; Peter Weiss also said : &quot; &quot; here the best food is produced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the state sponsorship policy ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg provides government support for f@@ ences .
the aim is to maintain the Black Forest .
the pre@@ condition is the presence of a conveying system designated by the L@@ PR .
&quot; moreover , the fence must not be smu@@ gg@@ able ( slope above 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by re@@ for@@ estation . &quot;
&quot; for the f@@ isher &apos;s f@@ ences project 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build almost 16 kilometres of fence , is currently underway . &quot;
&quot; the exhibition area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros . &quot;
is nothing sacred ?
now the White House of Tru@@ mp takes up the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans value these as much as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos place in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tru@@ mp regime , knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N on the proposals of the President for the dr@@ astic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to stay fair , Miller didn &apos;t handle the statue herself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of boat owners and liberty im@@ it@@ ators would have ra@@ ged him if he had done it .
&quot; but he took their meaning , and especially the meaning that was attributed to her when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to his base . &quot;
&quot; when Miller A@@ co@@ sta compla@@ ined , &quot; I don &apos;t want to enter a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illum@@ ines the world . &quot;
&quot; the poem which you refer to , which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; Miller is properly speaking , but as he formulated it himself , it is not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary response to the stirring words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ ary , your poor , / your afflicted masses who long to breathe freely , / the mis@@ erable waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time when the &quot; el@@ eventh apost@@ asy &quot; was better seen on our screens .
Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Tru@@ mp@@ s USA .
this conflict due to the significance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural debate : it is indeed a conflict about the meaning of America .
Lazarus - and their friends who advoc@@ ated to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they performed a highly political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American re@@ public@@ anism by portra@@ ying the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classical illustration .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a completely different name : mother of the ex@@ iles .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and just as Lazarus changed the significance of the statue , the people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the great cry of R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tru@@ mp , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty calls no one but rather an early neo @-@ conservative who brings the American flame to the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty proceeds . &quot;
it is intended to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
the torch should not illumin@@ ate the way to the United States . &quot;
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh stum@@ bled upon something here .
the meaning of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by exhausted , el@@ earning , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible journeys on the de@@ cks of ships . &quot;
&quot; in the tru@@ est sense , it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear .
&quot; and that is , of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tru@@ mp will ever recognize . &quot;
&quot; their torch should not illumin@@ ate the way , but the hatred which is their only source of power . &quot;
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the Great Britain Team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle recalls a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the United Kingdom Team
&quot; the Industrial Relations Director of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent on the World Cup will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 which ki@@ cks off on Friday .
black believes that &quot; in Scotland &quot; something special develops &quot; and the United Kingdom &apos;s athle@@ tics have to learn something from it .
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it , and we will continue it until we find it out , &quot; &quot; Black said . &quot;
I speak to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ alli@@ ons candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart , who are competing against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m course while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected team captain by the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is fairly modest . &quot;
&quot; her speech was incredible , &quot; Black says . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h naturally brought in were great .
&quot; the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver medal winner , who will compete with her fifth world champi@@ onships at the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the UK team . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s hitherto best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in the past year , the Mu@@ ir mid@@ range runners are leading five British and two European records . &quot;
&quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman to watch for a great season that included the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games . &quot;
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world champi@@ onships as the only other Scot@@ sman in Team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell .
&quot; the team captain says they are &quot; hu@@ gely proud &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots not only belong to the team , but in some cases also be mixed with the medals and at the fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the special thing about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honor anyway , but knowing that my team@@ mates voted for me and chose me , makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots belonging to the team . &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
&quot; and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb on po@@ di@@ ums . &quot;
what about my speech as captain ?
&quot; yes , I think she went well . &quot;
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to rely on this home support and benefit from being back in the Olympiastadion .
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and there will be just such a great atmosphere out there .
blocking Cri@@ tics on Facebook : don &apos;t worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate the elec@@ torate of voters .
the father of our country knew something from bad press .
&quot; Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t take long until the newspapers beat him because of everything from domestic politics to his political principles . &quot;
&quot; he compla@@ ined in criticism , certainly . &quot;
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; for in the year 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and silent , we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot;
&quot; that brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an , who has to work to be more like Washington . &quot;
Ho@@ gans &apos;s employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union accused him of the beginning of this week .
&quot; the governor &apos;s staff dismissed the suit as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a counter reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s only Facebook , &quot; many people said . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important if it is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state , which is amaz@@ ingly popular . &quot;
he has the second highest agreement of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary fl@@ us@@ head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very skill@@ ful to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and de@@ cip@@ her his hair @-@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
&quot; therefore , the blocking of persons coming to the governor &apos;s side - which is a public forum that is officially designated and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars , is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans nurse Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse defended the actions of the governor and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation . &quot;
but it is too easy to use the picture of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ ass@@ le @-@ filled people who oscill@@ ate online the whi@@ p .
the Post spoke to some of the real people blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; and these are just real people who speak to their chosen leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur and a priest , no troll@@ s . &quot;
&quot; they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not prof@@ ane . &quot;
the priest quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to the Catholic faith of Ho@@ gans .
&quot; lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not hat@@ eful , but she asked for hate crimes . &quot;
&quot; I was pol@@ ite that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary section of the news broadcast &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I also don &apos;t appreciate this idea when a number of people take a position on the same subject , then they are dis@@ regarded by some rather than a so @-@ called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the staff of the Gover@@ nor referred to as &quot; &quot; concentrated spam &quot; &quot; would probably call &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment .
&quot; it is much cleaner than in earlier times , if one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles and to arrest demonstr@@ ators and silence them . &quot;
but exactly that just happens digit@@ ally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public official who critic@@ ises Facebook and other social media .
President Tru@@ mp is accused of Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this issue fell last week in Virginia .
&quot; the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County passed the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to US district judge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when they banned a vot@@ er from their Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; and in K@@ entu@@ cky , governor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit to AC@@ L@@ U for his use of Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
this should not be so difficult .
&quot; at the time of Washington , the time of affordable Por@@ tos had a similar effect on the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers multiplied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous mail @-@ recor@@ ders hit his lead . &quot;
and even then Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
&quot; people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms such as &quot; jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers who made Washington decisions . &quot;
&quot; peti@@ tions , who critici@@ zed his position on the treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Great Britain , overwhel@@ med his office , according to historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project . &quot;
but he did not silence them .
&quot; freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses are the basis of our nation . &quot;
and true leadership means accepting this .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club
&quot; the former European No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for domestic comfort over the next three days , since the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an will host the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open . &quot;
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , who passed the Arch@@ er@@ field Links to the final round last year , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ve seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; the players will see this course from his best side , he is in a great condition . &quot;
Jer@@ ry made a great job when he found this place .
he is a di@@ ligent suppor@@ ter of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
&quot; the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , although he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career . &quot;
&quot; that feels really special , &quot; said the player based in South@@ port . &quot;
I have not been able to defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dur@@ a Open since it was taken out of the program in the year after I had won it .
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories from last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here . &quot;
it was a really special time and one we will always appreciate .
&quot; Gary Or@@ r , who came to European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday earlier this year , returns to the action on his home ground . &quot;
this event will be its first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a little more when you play at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this additional pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
I am happy about how far it has gone .
&quot; the trio on the field are the former Masters champion Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and Senior Champion Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ yer . &quot;
&quot; the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce is one of the six Scot@@ sman on the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dru@@ m@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; entrance is free , the parking place costs £ 5 per car with a passenger and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers . &quot;
all proceeds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less lung cancer due to passive smoking
fewer and fewer people died in lung cancer over the past two decades .
scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates , 16@@ 7 lung cancer cases are attributed to passive smoking , &quot; &quot; said Dr. Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot;
&quot; as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this subject from 1994 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , there were still 400 lung cancer cases given by passive smoking per year in Germany . &quot;
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
house connections prove to be very complex
&quot; the construction works in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; &quot; are reasonably in time , &quot; &quot; said the director of the court Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the house connections , the location is more complicated than expected , as there is a lot of mountains in the underground , which is not noted in the plans . &quot;
&quot; traffic , which is constantly ham@@ pered by the construction work , is a big problem for the company St@@ ump@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the ignorance of mot@@ orists from red lights and shut @-@ outs is already enormous , &quot; Hein@@ ze reports . &quot;
the road is locked and only the regular buses are allowed to drive through .

poverty and death in the Indon@@ esian gold@@ land
&quot; when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she doesn &apos;t use a stove . &quot;
it even rarely uses a pot .
&quot; in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent@@ ship in the un@@ peaceful Indon@@ esian province of Papua , the house@@ wife normally places a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour , the stolen tu@@ ber is removed with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands and swal@@ lowed . &quot;
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work such as washing clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby mar@@ sh .
a bucket in a homeless space serves as lat@@ rine .
&quot; as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , her fields were not assigned to her . &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; of course it can be dangerous to work late : most villa@@ gers are unemployed , and many drink heavy , and there are the soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to run around in the village after 17 o &apos;clock , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders had to vote by a public raising in front of the occupying troops . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , which stir@@ red up for independence against Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal observers from it . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the Province was officially distributed in Papua and West Papua , with the independent part of Papua New Guinea the eastern part of the island . &quot;
the journey includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 hour drive by car .
there is no public transportation .
&quot; the town with 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences and made of corrugated board roofs , which were converted by rust into various yellow @-@ brown tones . &quot;
&quot; only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here , let alone journalists and practically no for@@ eig@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; before Christian missionaries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans worshipped a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wearing these clothes , &quot; De@@ ge@@ i says , pointing to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright rock . &quot;
&quot; in the past , we had only sheets on our bodies . &quot;
&quot; Papua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia . &quot;
but it is also Indon@@ esian Gold@@ land .
&quot; the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gr@@ ass@@ berg , owned by Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Free@@ port mined gold and copper in the value of USD 3.1 billion . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Papua has wood resources worth $ 78 billion worth of dollars . &quot;
&quot; these wealth , however , are a source of misery for Papua , ensuring that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military keeps a sti@@ fl@@ ing presence . &quot;
&quot; a study from 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid local military personnel and units of nearly 20 million US dollars between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 150@@ ,000 dollars in one officer . &quot;
Pap@@ u@@ an demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten those golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
&quot; according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 jobs were killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed , tortured and imprisoned since 1969 by the Indon@@ esian military . &quot;
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s tribal land in the 1970 @-@ s have been committed to genocide in accordance with the Asia Human Rights Commission .
&quot; in the region alone , the Indon@@ esian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year . &quot;
&quot; we &quot; &quot; Do everything &quot; &quot; in a report of the Bris@@ ban@@ e arch@@ dioc@@ ese in 2016 , in which reports about atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as un@@ lawful kill@@ ings and torture - rape and electric sho@@ ot@@ ings are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s difficult to count the number of victims since every week incidents occur , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indon@@ esian researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; bolts have increased , as Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia . &quot;
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic developments are changing since Muslim economic migrants come from the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jav@@ an@@ ese waiting cant@@ e@@ ens sell fried chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce served . &quot;
local people fight to keep up here .
&quot; the migrants started selling chi@@ ckens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local , &quot; A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai local native to the province capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
&quot; it has cost the native Papua , the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Papua , their market . &quot;
&quot; the Indon@@ esian president Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , popul@@ arly known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised to tackle ine@@ qualities and violations of law in Papua during his campaign in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai , on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta . &quot;
&quot; but in Papua , little has changed , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken , because we voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , only two months after Jok@@ ovo &apos;s inauguration in October , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a low point . &quot;
&quot; on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indon@@ esian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle . &quot;
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should turn their head@@ lights on .
&quot; one of the soldiers took offen@@ se at their sound and later came back with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had drunk , ch@@ ased and beat the group with their rif@@ les , said victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of the children .
&quot; a child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ o , was so badly beaten that he fell into coma . &quot;
a few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
&quot; about 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered on a football field in front of the local police station and the Military Command Centre to demand justice . &quot;
they carried cerem@@ onial hunting bows and led the Wa@@ ita dance - running in the circle and initi@@ ating a bird song - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators began to throw stones on police and military posts .
&quot; when the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent a command over an internal funk : &quot; if the masses stand more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; it says in an official document of TI@@ ME , which was not released to the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto neighborhood of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the im@@ pending danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home . &quot;
nobody was in the mood to listen .
&quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot into my left wrist , &quot; &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the porch of his colorful painted wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the bul@@ let came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here . &quot;
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; &quot; he adds . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his cous@@ in , the witness of shooting . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and tried his body to be sure he was , &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who just like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans only bears a name , the TI@@ ME in a dark mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him .
&quot; the chief inspec@@ tor of the Papua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , reports that his officers wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station only because they were attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves if people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Papua @-@ Police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured . &quot;
the news about the kill@@ ings came only the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
&quot; three weeks , Jok@@ ow@@ i in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura gave a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to tackle the historical gri@@ ev@@ ances in Papua . &quot;
&quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , Minister of Security , Wi@@ ran@@ to , said that he had an out @-@ of @-@ court mechanism for sett@@ ling historical human rights violations . &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries have occurred a long time ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to addressing these violations , but there are processes that must go through , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
then Wi@@ ran@@ to made a retreat when he spoke to TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua .
&quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Wi@@ ran@@ to , who charged the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; that demanded more than 1,000 victims of death in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence vote , said that 11 cases of human rights violations have already been settled in Papua , including the pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such claims with a fi@@ ery integrity .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I am afraid of being arrested by the military , I fear being shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ey repeated the belief that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai fear to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I buried the corp@@ ses , the military looked for me , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not ceased .
on Tuesday the Indon@@ esian police fired on villa@@ gers in the Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood of Dei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a confrontation between villa@@ gers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring a unconscious man to the hospital , one person and 17 others were injured , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital . &quot;
excited villa@@ gers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s office .
the police said that the villa@@ gers threw stones on officers who responded by firing a warning .
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( Indon@@ esian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that it will give ven@@ ge@@ ance , &quot; &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered , so the TI@@ ME . &quot;
&quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai parliament has called to hold the officers involved and withdraw the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade from the police .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a flash@@ point for the Indon@@ esian government .
&quot; the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the family members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , which live in the green high@@ lands of Papua . &quot;
&quot; many joined the &quot; Free Papua movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , claiming to defend the rights of the Papua people by shooting spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indon@@ esian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , among them Ta@@ di@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ den Kog@@ o@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai have been arrested and arbitr@@ arily taken into custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot; &quot;
some never appear again .
&quot; among the people in Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot;
poverty strengthens dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of range .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potato .
&quot; they retain most of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market . &quot;
&quot; ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indon@@ esian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 C@@ ents ) . &quot;
&quot; over the course of time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown among the native Papua and the new migrants , who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to the Nab@@ ire airport . &quot;
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and weal@@ thier migrants .
&quot; occasionally , Papua have the capital or the necessary skills to make their own companies competitive . &quot;
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribe of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions on reporting international media remain ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported from Papua New Zealand because of lack of coordination with related institutions . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the Assistant Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is election campaign to raise the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s troubled provinces of Papua and West Papua : visa denial and a black list , &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indon@@ esian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March , six Pacific states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called for the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread violations &quot; in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting . &quot;
the same countries have historically supported the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indon@@ esian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r rejected the alleg@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; there is still a democratic system in Indonesia , and there is free media so that it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases . &quot;
people on the ground want more foreign governments to take note of this .
&quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , attended by the Human Rights ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4 , natives broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that would also participate in the meeting but remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua states that they probably won &apos;t vote again for Jok@@ ow@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribal council . &quot;
&quot; he wants that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that it lives under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military , is located in poor education and health services . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , consider their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; guilt &quot; that he has to pay back . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite threats and in@@ timi@@ dation , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims led a final symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the corp@@ se of an victim was buried in an area just opposite the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that perhaps justice will never come to them , but at least they will not forget their crimes . &quot;
&quot; one member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus with a lowered head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire captured the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
&quot; a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers of the world in Dubai , forcing hundreds of residents to flee from the 3@@ 37 meter high , 79 @-@ storey building . &quot;
it is the second fire that swept through the high @-@ rise in just two years that you acci@@ dentally call the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
&quot; the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; we slept and we got up with the fire alarm and the cries of the people .
&quot; we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; a resident told his name as George An@@ ab , Reu@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that the fire fighting units destroyed the fire at 4 : 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) , and the building cooled down . &quot;
the government said they work on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can revi@@ ve questions about the safety of materials used in external areas of high @-@ rises all over the world .
&quot; an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after the fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage caused by facing , exterior cl@@ adding to decoration or isolation came . &quot;
&quot; in Britain , the police said that the system of plates for insulation and fair@@ ing at the London Gren@@ fell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup reform : next Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has passed through with his great Davis Cup coup at the General Meeting of Shar@@ eholders .
&quot; at the Ho Chi Min@@ h City meeting , the two @-@ thirds majority voted for this sport @-@ revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup individual only on two wins . &quot;
&quot; although often very long , but also very much appreciated five @-@ set classics , the traditional competition is preserved . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of member countries voted for reform , the goal of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore scar@@ cely missed . &quot;
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our member@@ ships have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historic cont@@ ests , &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
I will continue to work on improving the application .
&quot; not until the vote , after many contradictions , the proposal had already come to take the final on a neutral place . &quot;
&quot; new from 2018 are only comparatively smaller details : in the following year , the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will have the host right in the first round in the following year . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements for training positions etc. are facilit@@ ated and the players will have to do less official media meetings before the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 out of 5 passengers brings forbidden items into the aircraft , find out a survey &quot;
&quot; a survey among air passengers yiel@@ ded that more than 20 percent of these items were smu@@ g@@ gled intentionally or un@@ consciously forbidden at the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft while they acci@@ dentally wore forbidden knives or other objects with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 percent claimed that they were late discovered that they were acci@@ dentally traveling with guns , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; the survey conducted by more than 1,000 people - powered by a jet charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger travellers rather neglect the rules . &quot;
&quot; the respon@@ dents who admitted that they unknow@@ ingly tried to fly with something banned by the T@@ SA , were 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X . &quot;
the most common items that were intentionally passed by T@@ SA agents were food and fluids .
&quot; more than 3 percent admitted to have know@@ ingly borne objects with blades through security control , while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male respon@@ dents confirmed that they intentionally brought illegal drugs to the aircraft . &quot;
the company said it consul@@ ted travelers throughout the country to find out how many in@@ adver@@ t@@ ently smu@@ g@@ gled goods would have brought about airport security and how many things had been intentionally done .
&quot; it is no surprise that people , who know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly bear - carry safety , those who fly most often . &quot;
&quot; however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and conf@@ using . &quot;
people are often uncertain about which liquids they are allowed to take with or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the largest quantity of liquids confis@@ cated by the T@@ SA are forbidden .
&quot; for a while , people thought that the T@@ SA could look at books as smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights . &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t care : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel order
&quot; electric @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k enjoys the huge number of orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; so far , he has assumed that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the ever tri@@ ump@@ hal@@ ed figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la @-@ CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k has for the first time revealed a different , less brilliant figure at the announcement of the recent quarter of the quar@@ terly report : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Mus@@ k has frequently recru@@ ited more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose extra@@ dition has just begun . &quot;
&quot; now Mus@@ k is dre@@ aming : of the 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders in total , 6@@ 3,000 had already been withdrawn . &quot;
critics repeatedly pointed out that it was merely non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; &quot; reservation payment &quot; &quot; completely . &quot;
&quot; currently 45@@ ,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations stipul@@ ate that Mus@@ k is in a telephone conference with analysts . &quot;
&quot; however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of so far about twelve percent of all orders could be a problem . &quot;
&quot; his argument : the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side . &quot;
&quot; last year Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; in 2018 , all models are to be taken together - 500@@ ,000 by 2020 one million . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , a total of 1800 bookings are made per day . &quot;
&quot; who orders a &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; today should expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand @-@ new , never in practice tested production lines with maximum capacity utilization . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; however , if it comes to major delays , then the non @-@ binding of the reservations might become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
because then the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running in flocks .
EPA boss P@@ ru@@ itt goes back to the reduction of emissions due to the execution of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules
&quot; one day after he had been su@@ ed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the head of the Environmental Protection Authority , with@@ drew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing pollutants . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change when his agency turned out to be responsive to the needs of state environmental agencies compared to previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the law@@ suit which had been raised against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
it is about a period that was going on on 1 October for states to comply with the standards of 2015 for down @-@ to @-@ earth o@@ zone .
&quot; in June , P@@ ru@@ itt declared that he would delay the observ@@ ance of a year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; interfer@@ ing with local decisions or hin@@ dering economic growth . &quot; &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was prosec@@ utor of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a prior to his appointment , was a reliable opponent of strict environmental regulations for a long time . &quot;
&quot; since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly passed over to blocking or dela@@ ying regulation , which resist@@ s the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal back for the P@@ ru@@ itts regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
&quot; last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ al in Washington decided that the EPA Administrator obli@@ ges his authority to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies committed to monitor and reduce methane leak@@ age . &quot;
&quot; in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that his revers@@ al in o@@ zone standards is simply the willingness of EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfilling the new standards . &quot;
&quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA has often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then wait to be charged by activists and others , and in an agreement to set the date for implementation , &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation by judicial proceedings , and we take deadlines seriously . &quot;
&quot; we also take the law and authority , which gives us , seriously . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the statement of the EPA said that eventually P@@ ru@@ itt will use his &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available authority &quot; to ensure that the rules are based on solid policies and the best available information . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive re @-@ establishment of the o@@ zone rules .
a bill approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet set up in the Senate .
&quot; the New York At@@ tor@@ ney General Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the Coalition of States who had su@@ ed the EPA this week , said the group intended to maintain the legal pressure . &quot;
&quot; the revers@@ al of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important asset for the health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g who flows into their communities , &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot;
&quot; in this case New York closed California , Connec@@ ti@@ cut , Del@@ aware , Il@@ lin@@ ois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ian , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia . &quot;
&quot; soil o@@ zone occurs when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere on sunlight . &quot;
&quot; the resulting smo@@ g may cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people , and each year contribute to thousands of premature deaths . &quot;
representatives of public health and environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered for a surprising change of course .
&quot; it is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the responsible for the protection of the air we inhal@@ e , &quot; &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot;
we must continue fighting against the ideological cr@@ us@@ ade of the Tru@@ mp government to address pollution and their particular interests .
Tum@@ bling celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
&quot; 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche , the old cemetery site in Tum@@ bling will be invited to a Ser@@ en@@ ade on Sunday , 16 July at 4.@@ 30 pm . &quot;
&quot; whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historical St. Hil@@ arius plant is a popular place to stay . &quot;
the visitors of the sixth benefit Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chanted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and promot@@ ers Tum@@ lin@@ gens their concern .
Walter Mart@@ ini emphasizes : &quot; it is a unique village gem .
&quot; in 12@@ 67 , the Chapel of St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kapelle was first mentioned in the Württem@@ berg@@ ische primitive customer book : &quot; &quot; Graf Hermann von Sul@@ z sold &quot; &quot; the mountain with the &quot; &quot; V@@ og@@ tei &quot; &quot; at Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver . &quot;
&quot; according to the wording of the certificate , on the Hill of Tum@@ ble , apart from the former parish church , there was also a magnificent court where the church or the pat@@ ron@@ age belonged , and not the other way round . &quot;
so there were also people there .
&quot; as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freuden@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , it was beside the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible today in the town picture of Tum@@ ble , the &quot; Mountain &quot; the third , the most beautiful sett@@ lers of the village . &quot;
old maps from the time around the year 1600 will under@@ pin these historical circumstances .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age arose from the early medieval self @-@ church law .
&quot; a master who built a church , ref@@ unded and occupied with a priest , remained the owner of this church and could also bequ@@ e@@ ath@@ ed this church . &quot;
this was the right to use a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop .
there were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the bigger of the two bar@@ red at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly acquired bell rang for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be delivered later in the Second World War in 1942 . &quot;
&quot; in the Thi@@ r@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 @-@ 16@@ 48 ) , the windows were cut and the bell parts were stolen . &quot;
the roof was leak@@ y .
in 17@@ 96 French troops camped near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church were threatened in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 the Tum@@ our Hil@@ arius cemetery was also the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was enlarged and the church of Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demol@@ ished .
only the church tower was left standing .
&quot; in the New Year &apos;s night in 18@@ 34 , a storm split the church tower and half crashed . &quot;
&quot; to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was stopped . &quot;
only the tower @-@ tower existing today was preserved as a witness of the 750 year @-@ old church history .
&quot; today , Horst K@@ all@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em maintain the Hil@@ arius plant as the successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn as the successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn . &quot;
&quot; the organizers invite the friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ lin@@ nen on Sunday 16th July , to the sixth Ser@@ en@@ ade on the old cemetery to the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kapelle . &quot;
this is designed by the Com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler High School Freuden@@ stadt and with essays by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
local leader Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann speaks the closing word .
the program starts at 16.@@ 30 .
admission is from 3.@@ 30 pm .
&quot; to conclude the seren@@ ade , a drink takes place in front of the cemetery . &quot;
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; the organizers take out the fantastic view . &quot;
the Ser@@ en@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organizers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historical St. Hil@@ arius site which is of importance for tum@@ bling and sound wel@@ ders .
&quot; the friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ lin@@ gens feel particularly committed to their home care , as Ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Mart@@ ini rein@@ forces . &quot;
association wants to review the approval of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim def@@ ends itself &quot; &quot; does not see a legal requirement for the construction and therefore has turned to the coun@@ cill@@ or . &quot;
Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) called on the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim region .
it is illegal .
&quot; the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved , since at the time in Vier@@ sen only a wind force concentration zone existed at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal . &quot;
&quot; within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city . &quot;
such zones shall prevent a &quot; saving &quot; of the landscape .
&quot; a few days earlier , the city of Vier@@ sen had approved a second wind force concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette by a change in the land use plan - but the district government of Düsseldorf did not appro@@ ve , because of a lack of form . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of planning permission , the approved approval requirement is still un@@ lawful and therefore also revers@@ ed , &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , chairman of &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot;
&quot; current state of affairs : before the summer break , the city council once again decided to leave the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette ; a permit from the district government is still pending . &quot;
&quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; thus , the issu@@ ance of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is legally excluded . &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of the request .
&quot; the corresponding writing has been entered in the circle of Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; explained a spokes@@ man . &quot;
the circle takes her to the occasion to re @-@ examine the matter again .
&quot; however , they are not likely to cause the procedure to be stopped . &quot;
&quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to comment on the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans to build four each 200 metres high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heim niche . &quot;
&quot; last year , the company , where the town of Vier@@ sen is indirectly involved , closed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 @-@ ac@@ re site . &quot;
&quot; with the establishment of the four wind turbines , the electricity requirement of around 11 400 households is to be covered - this corresponds to about a fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ grown households . &quot;
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
&quot; last summer , Vier@@ sen Stad@@ stepped gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Lin@@ ni@@ ch Wind@@ park near Aachen , as well as a stake in a wind turbine in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the Kreis Hein@@ sberg region . &quot;
car and tractor crash together : woman dies in a terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident happened on Friday morning at 10 o &apos;clock on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was mort@@ ally injured .
two more people were easily injured .
the state road remained closed for hours .
&quot; following police instructions , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch took the L 3@@ 33 in the direction of Bo@@ gel with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as accompanying person with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother . &quot;
city and dealer plan &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend
Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ sa and people from the region are to re@@ discover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September .
the industrial association and the city administration want to use the weekend on September 8th and September 9th to enti@@ ce the inhabitants to the shopping spre@@ e in the city centre .
&quot; as the chairman of the business association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend should sensi@@ ti@@ ze customers to what offers the own city has to store away from the usual supermarket . &quot;
forecasts illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; in addition , local companies are to present themselves with their apprenticeship places . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city center will invite you to &quot; &quot; midnight shopping &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in this context , the action not only targets residents of the city and the closer region . &quot;
&quot; in preparation there are commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bags pointing to the action weekend , says Christian king . &quot;
the municipal administration and the commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
this means that the industrial association and the city enter a further stage of the project &quot; Attrac@@ tive city center . &quot;
&quot; these include new offers such as the first &quot; active day &quot; to the well @-@ held well together with sal@@ eable Sunday , talks with all business@@ men and hosts to move them to active participation . &quot;
also attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees this day are part of the concept .
&quot; in addition , customer potential should be re@@ opened or re @-@ opened . &quot;
this includes spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals would have lost the city centre while shopping .
&quot; at the end , everyone would have to contribute to li@@ ven up the city centre - up to land@@ lords , the factories of the whole city and clubs . &quot;
&quot; it was necessary to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network , which was partly spreading , had told King in the spring . &quot;
&quot; Birgit St@@ reich , Head of the Chamber of Commerce in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , announced that the third &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; day , for the first time , took part in five Thurin@@ gian cities for the first time . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de . &quot;
&quot; the day should &quot; promote appreciation of local trade and raise its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot;
the action led by the Chamber of Commerce of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners makes it clear that every citizen with his buying behaviour can influence his direct environment .
two dead and several injured after explosion at US school
during construction there was a gas explosion in the school building .
new people have been injured .
&quot; in a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Min@@ ne@@ apolis , two people were killed and nine others were injured , some of them difficult . &quot;
&quot; according to the fire bri@@ g@@ ade , there was still a vulner@@ ability in critical condition on Wednesday ( local time ) . &quot;
a man died when a part of a school building collap@@ sed during the explosion .
&quot; a first missing , later , was also found dead . &quot;
at the dead they were employees of the school .
&quot; as a matter of luck , the authorities presum@@ ed working on a gas pipeline . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the holiday , there were only a few people in the building of the Minn@@ eh@@ aha Academy . &quot;
Tru@@ mp placed under pressure after trans@@ liter@@ ation of telephone calls Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Tru@@ mp and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
&quot; on 27 January , in a telephone conversation with Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena Nie@@ to , Tru@@ mp requested that he would not pay for a planned border wall . &quot;
&quot; the US president confis@@ cated him because he publicly den@@ ounced the wall . according to him , he said to him , &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot; &quot;
&quot; tru@@ mp started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and to make Mexico pay for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scripts of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp said Mr. Turn@@ bull said that a trade for the US refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia would be &quot; &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; mies &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; and that the existence on the trade presented by the Obama administration would make him look like a &quot; &quot; dep@@ p &quot; &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the United States . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp finished the call after he had said Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; &quot; that &apos;s the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ores Ford massacre : activists perform rac@@ ist ly@@ n@@ ching act as a call for justice
&quot; a 1948 @-@ he Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of spectators in rural Mon@@ ro@@ e , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men stepped out with guns to block its way . &quot;
the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle @-@ aged man in a needle @-@ stri@@ ped suit - took a long train on his ci@@ gar and looked at the wind@@ screen .
inside the occup@@ ants were ho@@ vering in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; the man ro@@ ared .
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
cries broke the silence when a young black man was dra@@ gged from the passenger seat .
&quot; fortunately this terrible scene , played on July 22nd , is just a post . &quot;
&quot; but when a loop around the neck of &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; is thrown , almost everybody in the audience met very real si@@ ghs . &quot;
&quot; since 2005 , citizens rights activists came back to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com and George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were ra@@ ged by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 . &quot;
no one has ever been charged with murder .
&quot; it is really incredible that no single person was arrested in all these years - even though we see them in our congregations , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps with the organisation of the post@@ ures . &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt spot on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
bro@@ o@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former Congress of the State of Georgia and a life @-@ long civil rights lawyer .
&quot; for him , read@@ ju@@ st@@ ment serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ ro@@ e community that injustice has never been corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must get justice , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
we cannot reach healing and reconciliation until we receive justice .
&quot; a for@@ en@@ sic physician places a sheet on the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ n on July 27 , 1946 . &quot;
&quot; according to F@@ BI files received by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ ro@@ e and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the ly@@ n@@ ching process . &quot;
but none has ever been accused .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects have been on a free walk for decades , Om@@ bud@@ sman said that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court in Georgia made it the first time to vote in Georgia for the first time to vote in the summer election campaign . &quot;
&quot; roughly at the same time as the election , according to the F@@ BI the black farmer &apos;s farmer Roger Mal@@ com , a white landlord , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , settled down during a fight - allegedly for a woman . &quot;
Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ our in the city had been that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she wore was not from her husband .
&quot; on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white country owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , such as the F@@ BI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey .
&quot; but when they went away from prison and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison who prepared and arranged the kill@@ ings , &quot; concludes F@@ BI &apos;s report . &quot;
&quot; it is also evident that there was a conspiracy between state and local law enforcement , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , removing evidence , and covering the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Broo@@ ks formul@@ ates it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; it was an electoral massacre , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; if you let yourself be registered and if you vote , this will happen to you . &quot;
&quot; for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual exhibition of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de . &quot;
&quot; their representation is illustr@@ ative , po@@ ign@@ ant and is based on a kind of deep racism , many of whom want to believe that he does not exist in America anymore . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to watch , and even more difficult to take away , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the ly@@ n@@ x because we are confronted with the ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; she said . &quot;
but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have done through .
&quot; the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest Black - pushed into a room and listened as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ene Co @-@ director .
&quot; he has played the role of the chief clan member for years , but he said that the role will never be easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story alive , because we don &apos;t want to return to those times . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the room actor Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the high priest scre@@ ams and urged him , fur@@ ious that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy . &quot;
&quot; I said , n --- he , wa@@ ving from my property ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ras@@ cona &quot; &quot; reci@@ proc@@ ates the fire . &quot;
there is a pause .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out into laughter .
Gre@@ ene laugh@@ ing at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; Ras@@ cona asked . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still gi@@ g@@ gling . &quot;
I just don &apos;t think that white people at that time have said &apos; n --- he &apos; .
&quot; but , &quot; &quot; wit@@ ched one of the other black performers . &quot;
&quot; you just have to hit the hard &quot; &quot; R. &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and exactly there the energy moves in the room , a feeling of cam@@ ar@@ ader@@ ie replaces the discomfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy getting this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene once more begins .
&quot; this time , when Ras@@ un says the N word , he says it sharp and with emphasis . &quot;
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends violent and fast .
&quot; there are scre@@ ams , shots and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman , dressed in a dress , stands above the body of the actor and leads Bil@@ lie Holidays , mour@@ ning praise &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot; &quot;
your voice breaks with every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it a group of about four dozen viewers caught sweat and tears from the eyes .
the audience is almost uni@@ form@@ ly divided between black and white .
&quot; a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , travelled to see the performance , many come down only the street . &quot;
they have experienced Geor@@ gy &apos;s oppres@@ sive humidity for nearly eight hours when Broo@@ ks leads her on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
&quot; up to this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when you stand on the same land where the ly@@ n@@ ch kill@@ ings took place , the air feels ghost@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the dead bodies . &quot;
&quot; children ho@@ ck on their heads , record the fake blood and the silent bodies and whis@@ per each other . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; m@@ um@@ bles a little boy , as if he wanted to remember . &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ ch@@ rope and wipe off their tears .
&quot; Brad@@ sha@@ w hu@@ gged Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit , who played the clan member . &quot;
&quot; Nick Ras@@ cona hu@@ gs two of his fellow players and then breaks down in their arms , the emotional burden of the performance eventually breaks out with him . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you did this for a reason . &quot;
&quot; later , the audience is sitting together with the actors for dinner . &quot;
&quot; at a table , a white pair of Atlanta talks about the po@@ sterity with a black couple that they just met . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky was fighting to find words , which feeling the performance left behind . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and do that because they look like you , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the ly@@ n@@ x is still going on , &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; today it is called police shooting . &quot;
&quot; in the same room , Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks holds yard at his table , he eats and reminds on citizen &apos;s rights . &quot;
he said he already started planning the performance next year .
&quot; the reproduction is inspiring in a way because it describes the hor@@ r@@ ors of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s like we don &apos;t learn anything from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dämm@@ erung &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bayreuth
&quot; in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf relies on a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ e staging in front of a gigantic , six @-@ story setting . &quot;
&quot; the stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner with wall rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and Ela@@ ste &quot; logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; before that , an open Mercedes classic car , in which the Rhine kill@@ ers pose as rock energies , or alternatively an Is@@ etta . &quot;
&quot; stack@@ ed oil barrels remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs leit@@ motif - money , power and greed - that goes through his &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; production . &quot;
&quot; the three Rhein@@ thal - sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke L@@ ehm@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ize as in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; wonderful . &quot;
&quot; they lead Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , dis@@ integrate a corp@@ se into the trunk of Hollywood @-@ Man@@ ier and enter the Kra@@ wall@@ o cli@@ que . &quot;
Stephen M@@ illing sings the wonderfully fi@@ esen Hagen that surrounds the aura of a heav@@ y@@ weight box@@ ers .
brutal the scene when he sm@@ iles Siegfried .
later Gun@@ ther ( Markus O@@ ak ) has to believe in it .
the audience thanks the ensemble with powerful applause .
&quot; Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and Con@@ duc@@ tor Jan@@ owski are ha@@ st@@ ened to a stor@@ my mood . &quot;
&quot; there is a big applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows for the first time on stage - given the great heat back in casual leisure wear . &quot;
the show was eag@@ erly awaited by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team of directors .
&quot; in 2013 he had to let a g@@ ist of the Pfei@@ f@@ Concerto pass over himself , there were five years later , great rejo@@ icing in which the isolated &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; calls went down . &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner was happy about that .
&quot; one notices that the audience has &quot; &quot; grown together with the &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; in a certain way , &quot; &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot;
&quot; the audience did not just make a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it was also an understanding of his view of view . &quot;
I draw a positive ré@@ sum@@ é .
Max amount works as a volunteer
they work in their voluntary year at several places .
where to go everywhere ?
&quot; quantity : normally in St@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture exchange , once a week I am here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge . &quot;
and I have already worked at the school in the open all @-@ day .
what are your experiences with it ?
&quot; quantity : it is a beautiful , wide spectrum that I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; they are 26 years now , so a late @-@ called volunteer . &quot;
how does that come about ?
quantity : I made a high @-@ school diploma .
&quot; and then a civil engineer , let &apos;s say , successfully broken off . &quot;
&quot; for me , I realized that it is wrong for me and I want to do something different with people . &quot;
&quot; and then I asked myself , what are you doing . &quot;
&quot; a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , at the focal point maybe also , really is . &quot;
and was it so ?
amount : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in social sciences in the winter semester .
&quot; I will study dual , probably do a social worker training in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne and study at Ham@@ m at the university of applied sciences . &quot;
is it not unusual to have several different locations during volunteer service ?
&quot; amount : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
it always depends on where you do your FS@@ J .
it is possible to do it from the old people &apos;s home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
&quot; I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care . &quot;
for me it was just the right thing that irrit@@ ated me .
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really runs out .
different from civil engineering ?
&quot; lot : well , here it is not about calcul@@ ating st@@ atics . &quot;
there are always other people in front of us who have a completely different story behind them .
whether a refugee or a young man who has been brought out of the family - you always have to respond to them individually .
very interesting .
and you had no reservations ?
quantity : for this I am not the guy .
it is an area that gives a lot .
&quot; lots of love , a lot of kindness . &quot;
&quot; there are also times negative moments , but so is life . &quot;
Pear@@ son cuts additional 3,000 jobs and cuts divi@@ den@@ ds to revi@@ ve the business
&quot; the British Educational Group Pear@@ son said on Friday that she will cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its divi@@ den@@ ds by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure that the company faces . &quot;
&quot; the job breakdown , which the Director General John Fall@@ on primarily announced for the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring , where 4000 jobs have already been lost . &quot;
&quot; in May , Pear@@ son announced plans to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) in a third cost @-@ cutting program to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the rapid pace of digital learning . &quot;
&quot; the company , which had sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House last month to partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged after achieving an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year . &quot;
Kon@@ vo@@ i attack from Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
&quot; a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afghan capital Kab@@ ul , killed a soldier of Nato and injured several others , say civil servants . &quot;
&quot; five soldiers and an interpreter were viol@@ ated , shared an explanation of Nato . &quot;
&quot; according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians were killed in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district . &quot;
the bombing is the last violence hit by Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at on Tuesday .
&quot; on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul . &quot;
&quot; in a statement by NATO , it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening had happened when a common pat@@ rol with the Afghan army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; impro@@ vised explosive sentence &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all the injured are in a stable state and treated at the Bag@@ ram airport in the US military hospital .
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram . &quot;
&quot; according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of which were in the capital . &quot;
&quot; at the end of July , suicide bom@@ b@@ ings killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul . &quot;
the Taliban said they had carried out this attack .
&quot; on May 31 , a massive bombing in the center of the city killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack on the country since the US @-@ led troops in 2001 pushed the Taliban out of power . &quot;
&quot; violence highlights the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp is considering increasing the number of U.S. forces supporting military and police in the country . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , their policies and especially in the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f Gh@@ ani . &quot;
EPA turns decision to delay the smo@@ g rule after col@@ lagen
&quot; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has a decision to delay a regulation of the government of Obama , repe@@ aled what states are committed to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this happened one day after 15 states su@@ ed the agency because of the step . &quot;
&quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday to push forward the so @-@ called o@@ zone provisions 2015 , and said they show the commitment of the agency to co @-@ operate with states . &quot;
&quot; we believe in the dialogue with and hereby that we respond to our state partners , &quot; said EPA boss Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; in June , P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of EPA to determine the o@@ zone regulations , in which pollut@@ ant emissions should be measured in part of the country , to specify where cuts must be made to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 most democratic states , along with Colombia &apos;s district , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tru@@ mp has tried to return a broad range of environmental conditions imposed by former President Barack Obama , as part of a broader agenda that will boost economic growth according to Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; however , the efforts have raised the set@@ backs of the Democrats and conservation groups who are concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the EPA website says that inhal@@ ing air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; &quot; reduce lung function and strengthen respiratory symptoms &quot; , &quot; such as asthma . &quot;
community wants community space
&quot; in the end , the decision was clear : with two opposing votes , the Municipal Council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ ds resol@@ ves the establishment of a common room in the future sen@@ iors @-@ residential complex . &quot;
&quot; before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase contract for the missing part of the land was signed , reports Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; while still the church community still belonged to the church community , it will still take a while now , but there is no planning obstacle for the project that is to be stem@@ med from a private investor . &quot;
&quot; for this , there is a discussion with regard to a shared space . &quot;
one of the two investors who are still in the boat offered to meet the community .
&quot; on the ground floor , it would provide a living space of about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with 70 square meters of space for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the administration and the majority of the Municipal Council are ho@@ vering such a common room not as a meeting place only for the inhabitants of the sen@@ i@@ rous living , but openly into the church . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word &quot; &quot; kn@@ itted café &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot;
the decision made by the provision of funds for the current household has already been decided last autumn by means of funding .
the construction is in the re@@ development area .
&quot; the establishment of a joint room would be , according to T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; the proposal envis@@ ages to signal the investor that , in this respect , there is no bil@@ let between the legs , the finding that both saddle - what is le@@ aning against the environment @-@ building - as well as the roof @-@ roof - which reduces the gap and makes the construction more economical - would be possible . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less to say , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer thinks of this addition . &quot;
&quot; if it helps , it happens in a unanim@@ ous way by the body . &quot;
it is not as easy as the common room .
&quot; Daniela &apos;s call points to the many own buildings , with which one does not move forward so much , but if one likes to lean towards the common room of the window , she says , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m really doing it with it . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger is strongly speaking for the common room - but absolutely against municipal participation .
&quot; after that , she sees a hidden subsi@@ dy to already wealthy , or even foreign investors . &quot;
&quot; this is not the case , as with the acquisition of the area there is no surplus , but I get a real counter @-@ value in the case of doubt , is the counter @-@ speech . &quot;
&quot; Sta@@ ig@@ ger &apos;s proposal to ple@@ ad the resolution accordingly , will find three advoc@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; so it remains with two counter@@ parts in the original programme , which sums up Stefan H@@ aller : &quot; if we make the decision so , we make a huge step to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;
collision with Car : cyclists are thrown onto the road
&quot; while crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist was captured by a car on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath and badly injured . &quot;
&quot; as the police announced , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was travelling on the bicycle path of the Schwar@@ zer road from Hil@@ den on the bicycle path of the Schwar@@ zer road . &quot;
the senior wanted to cross the road to the bush Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car leader in the same direction granted him priority .
&quot; when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder was driving onto the street , he obviously didn &apos;t pay attention to the counter @-@ traffic . &quot;
he met a car with a 66 @-@ year @-@ old hel@@ per .
the man was thrown onto the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was transferred to a hospital with a ret@@ ou@@ ting carriage .
FC Bayern Munich must ab@@ stain from the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup will take place without him : David Al@@ aba must leave the game against Dortmund .
&quot; with personnel care , the FC Bayern will be travelling to Dortmund for the first mandatory game of the new season . &quot;
seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the cup winner .
&quot; in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20,@@ 30 a.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) , personnel care at the German soccer league of Bavaria Munich is getting bigger and bigger at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund . &quot;
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti needs to ab@@ stain from David Al@@ aba in du@@ el with BV@@ B .
this confirmed the Italian on Friday .
&quot; in addition , the mou@@ ths of Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing . &quot;
&quot; for the five defe@@ ats in the past six years , An@@ cel@@ otti has been responsible for the physical condition and the missing balance in the game of his team . &quot;
&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added , &quot; &quot; The most important point is the balance in the team . &quot;
&quot; last but not least , this was not good . &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory game of the season .
&quot; football is also a tac@@ tic , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot;
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; we want to play intellig@@ ently , &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; difficult , intense game . &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the German soccer heav@@ y@@ weights draws the fans into its spell .
&quot; the game was sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , divided the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday . &quot;
walking in the Harz Mountains from Star to Star
&quot; in the resin , the first &quot; &quot; Star Path &quot; &quot; is to be created . &quot;
the association is planning the Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a Plan@@ etary Trail in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; Star Path &quot; &quot; is coming to meet the need for information of many Har@@ z@@ go@@ ers , it was called . &quot;
&quot; he combines nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance . &quot;
the members wish to set up boards along the planned route and inform about stars and stars .
&quot; in a first phase of 2018 , the &quot; &quot; Acces@@ sible Install@@ ations in five to six locations &quot; &quot; will be in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; in question : St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber . &quot;
the information on the panels should be supplemented by internet .
&quot; therefore , a good mobile network reception plays a role in selecting a location . &quot;
accessibility is also a criterion .
&quot; later , the Star@@ Path train is to be extended by train . &quot;
&quot; on the star trail the viewer experience a lot of interesting facts , such as the physics of the individual stars , &quot; explained the association . &quot;
&quot; they also learned why stars had different colors , or why a star den@@ ounced more than another , even though it was far more distant . &quot;
&quot; also , in which con@@ stellation is a selected star , and when it is best to see . &quot;
&quot; since 2014 , the association has been operating the highest observ@@ atory of Northern Germany in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany . &quot;
often the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a gal@@ axy with naked eye can be seen clearly .
&quot; since 2003 on the initiative of the Förder@@ verein Planet@@ arium Göttingen , there is something similar to the planned star wer@@ g - the Plan@@ etary Trail . &quot;
&quot; starting in front of Geb@@ har@@ ds hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the Plan@@ etary Trail leads up to H@@ ain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; site in Di@@ em@@ arden with the Plan@@ etary Sed@@ na . &quot;
the stel@@ es with the individual planets - including the d@@ warf @-@ planet degra@@ ded Plu@@ to at the end point - are positioned exactly in the distance and scale of one to two billion .
&quot; the earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 mm in diameter , while the sun exactly 75 meters away measures 70 centimet@@ res . &quot;
the entire distance of the Plan@@ etary Trail is about four kilometers .
&quot; while the light from Sun to Plu@@ to takes about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour up to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to . &quot;
&quot; thus , pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos . &quot;
&quot; the march to the next fix , however , would take half a year . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down &quot;
&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a collision course to stage the most exciting fight in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , to Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council light weight champion , down the hall@@ way to welcome Lom@@ ach@@ enko to the World Bo@@ xing Organisation super fe@@ ather weight champion . &quot;
&quot; after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous decision about the former four @-@ divisions champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday in Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the Top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ List . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; How are you , champion ? &quot;
I wish you a lot of luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 pm on ES@@ PN .
&quot; as the couple pos@@ ing for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko Manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas noticed that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect magnitude . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a former weight of the pen , &quot; &quot; recalls Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; I have risen to Bron@@ er &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I am not so great . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to get down to light weight .
and he must move on weight @-@ weights &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that is what the fans demand .
let us give them that . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot;
&quot; climate asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 @-@ pound debut this year ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also interest in the battle against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their weight @-@ weight title fight in the Forum on September 23 . &quot;
&quot; this fight could take place in Pay @-@ per @-@ View mode because all fans asked him , &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia and later openly expressed himself openly to fight with the network , which offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ...
&quot; Gar@@ cia said he appreciated Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; &quot; an enormous fighter &quot; , &quot; and he possibly will take part in his Saturday battle . &quot;
&quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko said with the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he think the tri@@ but@@ ary champion from River@@ side looks very slow , sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted the co @-@ off . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said , the focus was to show impact , then boxing . &quot;
&quot; both said they could feel the momentum , which was built up for their own struggle . &quot;
this is the battle that must be carried out .
no other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; Gar@@ cia said . &quot;
&quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said : &quot; &quot; I waited for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot;
it will be a great battle . &quot;
four injured after tire plat@@ ter
&quot; in the event of an accident on the A@@ 7 , four people were seriously injured in the afternoon . &quot;
&quot; after the first information , the driver of an Opel Za@@ fir@@ a lost control of his vehicle shortly before the junction in the market . &quot;
&quot; the passenger car left the em@@ bank@@ ment to the right , where he over@@ turned and then remained on the roof in the green stri@@ pe . &quot;
the four in@@ mates - two adults and two children - were badly injured in the accident .
&quot; during the first supply of the injured by the rescue service , the A@@ 7 was closed to the north for about an hour , then the traffic on the left lane could be passed by the accident site . &quot;
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; three chain works better &quot;
&quot; after 2 : 2 , and@@ re Hoffmann is hoping that the optimisation of the defense formation in Au@@ e points hopes . &quot;
&quot; with the first season game Andr@@ e Hoffmann was happy with the result , too , if not the two opponents would have been against Br@@ uns@@ wick at 2 : 2 . &quot;
&quot; these were two opponents too much , and we have to fit better in Au@@ e , &quot; says the defensive player of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains the tri@@ p@@ eter should also be optimised further .
and the For@@ tun@@ en doesn &apos;t want to catch a gate after a jump .
&quot; for the future , there will be no more than Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line . &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will get better after the experience in the preparation with the triple @-@ chain than with the four @-@ box .
&quot; I don &apos;t know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; because we have just in the three @-@ dimensional chain at the semi @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko Gieß@@ mann players who can build well , &quot; Hoffmann said . &quot;
&quot; the prerequisite is , however , that we harmon@@ ise even better and we don &apos;t have so many playing mistakes in the construction . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann will drive to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; but whether you can talk about a mis@@ guided start , don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could be ok , &quot; Hoffmann said . &quot;
&quot; but if we stand at four points on Sunday and can concentrate on the tro@@ phy , we will certainly be able to speak of a good season op@@ ener . &quot;
his trainer didn &apos;t want to know about it .
&quot; I don &apos;t judge the start into the season only after six to eight playing days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who didn &apos;t want to talk about an advantage over Au@@ e just because the game of the Sax@@ ons in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be abor@@ ted pre@@ mat@@ urely because of a storm . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , that the players from Au@@ e might even be a bit fres@@ her as they could not have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a promotion favorite in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they do not know as 100 per cent where they are currently standing , &quot; says the Interior Defender of Fort@@ una . &quot;
&quot; ad@@ mitt@@ edly , the guests from the Rhin@@ eland play as a light favorite on Sunday in the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e . &quot;
&quot; that we sweep them off just because we have the right to come under the first six is stupid , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive with only one defeat against an eye out of nine games . &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , which you have to hit from the start , &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as chief coach . &quot;
to make such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t .
&quot; and so , Funk@@ el will not be able to experience his players on Sunday . &quot;
new results of the Swedish asylum @-@ age test results published
&quot; the recent findings of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , who have been subjected to a new method of medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the subjects tested are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish authority for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) has started to carry out tests last year .
&quot; during the asylum procedure , they should make the assessment of age more precise after the Swedish migration authority ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) has been critici@@ zed for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were under age . &quot;
&quot; to date , migration pan@@ et has sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 cases to test@@ able cases , and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
&quot; ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , whereas in another 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot; &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person was &quot; possibly under 18 years of age . &quot;
tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are consistent in recent months . &quot;
&quot; we see no big difference in statistics of the past few months , figures are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; he said , The Local . &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person has been assessed for over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er has lied over his age .
in May the agency released the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases that suggest that the subjects were 18 years or older .
&quot; when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det examined the results published 5@@ 81 , she noted that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had said openly that she would be 18 years old this year . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical age assessment , when x @-@ ray images of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , was also critici@@ zed in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a scep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work involves the evaluation of the biological maturity of people to see if they were earlier or later than usually passed through pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot;
assessing the biological age in this way is very uncertain .
&quot; if we can &apos;t say it , we shouldn &apos;t do it as if we could , &quot; &quot; he said to the newspaper Metro . &quot;
&quot; however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of a child as an adult is in@@ correctly judged . &quot;
&quot; the biggest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case this is about 10 percent . &quot;
full in plan
the work on the three bridges of the road 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
&quot; on Wednesday , a heavy concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; we are very good at the time , it works great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , forem@@ an at the Department of Road Engineering and Transport in the District of the District of Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April , the work began at the same time on all three rehabil@@ itated bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
the end of the building is planned for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule is respected .
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is a concrete sla@@ b bridge made of concrete , which is cla@@ d with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4,@@ 80 meters . &quot;
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; like the other two bridges , it has meanwhile arrived in the years . &quot;
&quot; in order to guarantee the stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly refurbished . &quot;
the two other bridges run over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built from red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 metres long . &quot;
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons heavy so @-@ called bridge deck .
this is a ver@@ ge attachment which is also used as a work@@ station .
&quot; on the southern part of the bridge , a 2.@@ 20 m wide bridge deck is to be used on Friday . &quot;
then the pedestrian walk@@ way is to run .
&quot; the special thing is that it is pre@@ fabricated elements , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented brid@@ ging caps .
special t@@ act of t@@ act has required the laying of pipes through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; because there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable , which many companies are connected . &quot;
local residents were informed about the project prior to work .
&quot; in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; for the bridges between the building yard and the collecting point in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated by means of a traffic light . &quot;
&quot; for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach village entrance , the street in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is completely closed . &quot;
&quot; the cost of the three bridge buildings amounts to 700@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the whole thing is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ unter Protest at German potato salad
&quot; it is not so often that parties are pulling together , but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) comes together , which is otherwise difficult to bring under a hat . &quot;
&quot; the parties represented in the circle of volcanic Eifel ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) belong to a broad alliance that shows peac@@ efully this day because the Af@@ D invites in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle R@@ ond@@ ell to the &quot; big election campaign &quot; poster . &quot;
&quot; and known names to the start - as Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the peak duo for the German elections on September 24 , and the Vice @-@ President Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; but those who are on the spot already hours before the start of the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ D , but demonstrate . &quot;
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot;
&quot; the city picnic was originally planned under the motto &quot; &quot; All at a table &quot; &quot; on the fountain square , but now takes place on the parking lot below the R@@ ond@@ ell - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle . &quot;
a colorful picture that offers itself .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chairman of the Forum A World and one of the bes@@ tial organizers , is really pleased : &quot; great how many people came together here . &quot;
&quot; there is music and lots of food , including an &quot; original potato salad , which could easily eat the Af@@ D , &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot;
&quot; the police have ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing presence especially at the railway station , which is only a few metres away from the venues . &quot;
how did the Af@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pe of the Af@@ D volcanic Eifel reported that he tried to make an event and get the extra charge .
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf was first in demand in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes there are not enough parking places available . &quot;
&quot; so now the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ pe is pleased that &quot; &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he says : &quot; &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; this also does it : at about 8 p.m. a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle , provides various speakers , among them the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Af@@ D chair Uwe Young . &quot;
&quot; in the hall there are about 200 listeners who wait for the top candidate to choose the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; the police presence is unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; a little more than an hour the Af@@ D event , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is a short time after 21 o &apos;clock . &quot;
the police can move away - no special incidents .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
&quot; there is a re@@ union with the Wolf@@ man Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli in the series Has@@ la@@ cher Kloster@@ concerts tomorrow , Sunday , at 8@@ pm in the monastery church . &quot;
&quot; together with Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or &quot; Bal@@ kan@@ ia &quot; meets a classical German education with roots in brass music . &quot;
both solo@@ ists are winners and pri@@ z@@ ew@@ inners of numerous international competitions and have held solo performances in European top @-@ level orchest@@ ras .
Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the solo@@ ist of the prestigious Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is the solo@@ ist of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
&quot; both unite the desire not only to cross the borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres . &quot;
&quot; as Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new gu@@ ise , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music &quot; is combined with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the Jazz ech@@ o@@ ist N@@ ils W@@ ogram , combines classical , jazz and free play into a fascinating Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk . &quot;
this core of the programme was first performed this spring with great success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher Klo@@ sterk@@ irche with its special acoustics is consciously included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart speaks about their bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .
&quot; but I want to try out everything , &quot; Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart has been openly talking about their bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; when I bite into grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood star was that of her &quot; &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who eventually dealt with bit@@ terly . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the brun@@ ette Dar@@ stell@@ erin is insured against the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Ba@@ z@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I fell in love with every seriously I had . &quot;
&quot; or do you think about , I would have played it ? &quot;
&quot; after her separation , Kri@@ sten stressed that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed the du@@ alism . &quot;
so it never interfer@@ ed with or hin@@ dered me .
I just never liked to be taken seriously .
&quot; especially among them she said loud &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; but in the school time , when she preferred to dress like a bu@@ b : &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
this really hurt me .
&quot; when I was eleven , the children told me that I would look like a boy . &quot;
&quot; I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and embarrass@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; now I look back and think : &apos; girls , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
&quot; especially the public do not like to explain their love life : &quot; &quot; people expect you to be in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me . &quot;
&quot; and perhaps some consider me to be und@@ able , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself from the whole public . &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes the party
&quot; the Democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Tru@@ mp that he will change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of reflection ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I &apos;m a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the re@@ public@@ ans , &quot; Justice added . &quot;
as a trainer I would say it &apos;s time to play another game .
Mr. Tru@@ mp promised a big announcement at the West Virginia Rallye before .
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; Justice , who according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 . &quot;
For@@ bes finds that he has coal mines in five states and inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth approximately $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
&quot; meanwhile , the Republi@@ can National Committee on Thursday evening gave an explanation in which it said : &quot; &quot; the change of the party by Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic party that would rather prevent us than work to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement by Gover@@ nor Justice is only the last refusal of a party which is from top to bottom without a leadership and is not able to find a positive one @-@ ing message , &quot; &quot; said Ms Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News . &quot;
Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal
&quot; the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , commen@@ ded on Thursday what he described as obvious ap@@ ology from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed in the sport . &quot;
Russian athle@@ tics boss D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF conference on the eve of the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
he said it was sorry for &quot; all athletes who were caught out of gold and silver medals at competitions .
&quot; despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress approved for maintaining the ban , which was imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) had found evidence of state @-@ supported dop@@ ing in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer , a very honest presentation today , &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e to the re@@ porter . &quot;
&quot; the whole Council and the whole Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has recognized by itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times , and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot;
Co@@ E said he was also &quot; delighted &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re@@ introduction .
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think progress was made , but the Congress endor@@ ses the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to re @-@ use Russia , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation .
&quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupt system , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the athle@@ tics world champi@@ onships , which begin on Friday in London , according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors . &quot;
&quot; the leader of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia needed to meet some of the criteria for re @-@ setting . &quot;
&quot; drug tests are still inadequate and prohibited trainers are still free , &quot; &quot; said re@@ porters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot;
ob@@ itu@@ ary Ob@@ last for Sol@@ di@@ ers crashed in Mali
&quot; at a funeral service in the northern h@@ ess@@ ische Frit@@ z@@ lar , about 1000 people of the two soldiers have been thinking of a helicopter crash in Mali . &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security precau@@ tions .
Minister of Defence Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing to be un@@ explained .
&quot; she described the two inver@@ ted pilots , however , as &quot; &quot; cor@@ on@@ ers of their trade . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bow to this highest sacrifice which they gave in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; she explained . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ erh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Northern H@@ esse came to life on Wednesday a week ago in the West African Mali .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and accompanied by a vi@@ gil of the Bundes@@ wehr in the Frit@@ z@@ ew@@ er Dom Saint Peter on Thursday .
&quot; at noon , only the members of the church took leave . &quot;
&quot; after that , the funeral service began in the circle of the family , close friends , representatives of the German army and politics . &quot;
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
&quot; rose @-@ branches laid down roses , the members of the family standing arm in arm at the coff@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; in front of the church , Frit@@ z@@ lan@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas . &quot;
Secretary of Defense of Le@@ yen called the inver@@ ted soldiers as &quot; highly decorated &quot; and sat@@ ini@@ zed .
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann had built the flight operation of the fighter pilot tig@@ ers in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tig@@ ers of his regi@@ ment .
&quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the regi@@ ment to which the soldiers belong , said : &quot; if this occupation could not turn off the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot;
doubts about the UN Mission in Mali did not show Minister of the Le@@ yen : the deployment was dangerous .
&quot; but he is also of great importance &quot; for a country from which we are separated only by two states , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; after the funeral , the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral . &quot;
&quot; when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information . &quot;
Prince Hen@@ rik wants no grave next to his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death . &quot;
that divided the King &apos;s House on Thursday .
&quot; traditionally , the Danish royal couple are buried in Ros@@ kil@@ de &apos;s cathedral church . &quot;
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
the Queen agreed with her husband &apos;s decision .
&quot; where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , be still unclear . &quot;
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik never made a secret from him that he was not happy with his title .
&quot; after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become king . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , he retired and also sets off the title of &quot; &quot; Prin@@ c@@ eu@@ fer &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; since Hen@@ rik did not get the title and function he wanted , he did not see himself as equivalent to his wife - not even after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the editor of the Danish royal court . &quot;
&quot; where the last resting @-@ place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , is still unclear . &quot;
&quot; but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the country he has worked for over the last 50 years .
&quot; born in 1965 in London , Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French ari@@ sto@@ cratic family . &quot;
he worked in the French embassy on the Th@@ ames .
&quot; during his later wife &apos;s sympath@@ ies , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his almost 50 @-@ year reign with the Dan@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik wrote about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did was critici@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was sw@@ inging , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stock@@ ings instead of kn@@ it@@ so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation to be the brand of socio @-@ critical intellectuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence . &quot;
I was different .
I seem to be happy with this position and not to be ashamed .
these were just two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants a quick re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; Nieder@@ sach@@ sen &apos;s Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a quick re @-@ election of the parliament , but he does not want to res@@ ign . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , it was said that the resolution of the parliament was deb@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; prior to that , the surprising exit of a Gre@@ ens de@@ pu@@ ties from its parliament in Lower Saxony had pl@@ ung@@ ed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a severe crisis . &quot;
&quot; five months before the official date of the election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hannover lost its scar@@ ce one @-@ voice majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the former Green MP El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests founded her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the election of 2018 in her constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ ü@@ mme ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; she said on Friday in Hanover . &quot;
s &amp; D leader Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his faction to take it up .
&quot; thus CD@@ U and F@@ DP have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony State , SPD and Green 68 seats . &quot;
&quot; so far , the relationship has been revers@@ ed . &quot;
the new Land@@ tag will be held regularly on 14 January next year .
&quot; as Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said , the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether it could continue to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , however , considers it imperative that the Land@@ tag as soon as possible decides its self @-@ resolution . &quot;
the CD@@ U is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the state constitution also fores@@ ees the possibility that the Land@@ tag draws the trust to the Prime Minister and chooses a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; our constitution offers several options . &quot;
&quot; these options must be insp@@ ected legally , &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; in peace , all questions will be discussed , if they are legally tested . &quot;
&quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called &quot; &quot; T@@ west@@ ens step &quot; &quot; but somewhat strange . &quot;
the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
she described herself as a follow@@ er of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called for the apost@@ ate parliam@@ ent@@ arians to return their land convention .
&quot; we , of course , assume that they have returned their land convention , which has received them over the green country list , with immediate effect , &quot; divided the pres@@ idents Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; the Group president of the Green Party Anja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; we deeply regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ ests . &quot;
she deliberately decided not to lead any pron@@ unciation in the Group .
&quot; even against the background that there were no differences in content , we cannot understand this step . &quot;
&quot; SPD chan@@ cell@@ or candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transition of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens , El@@ ke T@@ ests to the CD@@ U as treas@@ on . &quot;
&quot; the behaviour of the former Green Socialist MEP in Lower Saxony is not just treas@@ on to voters , but also betra@@ yal of red green , &quot; the Federal President of the Socialists and Democrats wrote on Facebook on Friday . &quot;
he supported the decision by Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly elect the Land@@ tag .
the exit of T@@ west@@ ens costs Red @-@ Green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; the politicians of the politicians &quot; in their ver@@ itable vanity and in their fru@@ stration are their personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; said SPD Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot;
it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony takes part in this dirty intri@@ gue game and tries to hammer out political capital .
Nieder@@ sach@@ sen CD@@ U @-@ leader Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his de@@ pu@@ ties to include El@@ ke T@@ ests in the CD@@ U .
&quot; the SPD leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , accused T@@ v@@ ests of fal@@ si@@ fying the results of the 2013 Land@@ tag election with personal career presents . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U was before the SPD its strongest power , SPD and Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority of a voice in the parliament day . &quot;
&quot; Minister of Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect ourselves from gyp@@ si@@ es , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany is discussing about contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is in an interview with the German editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
&quot; Mr. Schmidt , How can consumers protect themselves from pois@@ oned eggs ? &quot;
I can only encourage all consumers to look at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp resolution .
&quot; on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the Länder provide the latest information on the affected eggs @-@ Char@@ gen . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if according to everything we know at the moment , a health hazard is practically impossible . &quot;
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis response - all eggs get out of the offer - because the central role of the educ@@ ator is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture .
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has turned up immediately and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of the sad@@ ness of Germany . &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
trade has the same way as manufacturers to ensure that the sold products are market@@ able and safe to health .
&quot; if the residual value of 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded in eggs , these are not market@@ able . &quot;
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time the companies are not to blame .
do production plants and consumers sit in the same boat ?
&quot; according to the state of knowledge , the production plants do not find immediate fault . &quot;
&quot; rather , they must expect economic damage due to suspected illegal practices of service companies . &quot;
&quot; as always , there is too little control . &quot;
is it missing only at the staff or on the conclu@@ sive jurisdiction ?
it was just the official controls that have revealed the process .
&quot; however , the truth also includes that food fraud and criminal energy can never be eliminated by 100 percent . &quot;
this is precisely why a consequ@@ ent clari@@ fication of such events and the transfer to the public prosec@@ utor in the cases where criminal off@@ ences are available are of decisive importance .
&quot; I have already made it clear several times , that I expect a complete explanation by the responsible authorities . &quot;
is the regular alarm in food sc@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
consumers have the right to only obtain safe and market@@ able food .
&quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly ou@@ tra@@ ged . &quot;
&quot; by means of the pur@@ ged means , manufacturers , dealers and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; in principle , it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food@@ borne animals cannot be tolerated and must be stopped immediately . &quot;
&quot; at all levels , it is necessary to work consistently and with high pressure on all levels . &quot;
I expect from all competent authorities that the fact is quickly and comprehen@@ sively elu@@ ci@@ dated .
how the Finance Reg@@ ulations of Football on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ imp@@ eded issues of European football clubs will not dis@@ rupt N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
&quot; any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from UEF@@ A , as the guiding organization that over@@ sees the European game has the power to prohi@@ bit teams from entering the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial Fair Play rules , launched in 2011 by UEF@@ A , mean that PS@@ G has to prove at some point that N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s transfer has been financed without major losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million $ ) to get the Brazi@@ li@@ ans out of their contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary which will amount to tens of tens of millions of dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
&quot; PS@@ G can safely make the money loose , so that N@@ ey@@ mar writes and put it into a gal@@ axy of other stars , given the financing of the team by the energy rich royal family of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the purchase of players , but have to counter@@ act with legitimate income sources that allow them the break @-@ even point in their football @-@ related business . &quot;
&quot; FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini , after his election to the UEF@@ A pres@@ idency in 2007 . &quot;
&quot; the former French player believed that clubs , who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success , effectively che@@ at and ris@@ ked to ruin themselves when banks or owners with@@ drew their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentration to the debt of the clubs to monitor their losses . &quot;
&quot; the change meant that the business model , the Roman Abr@@ am@@ ovi@@ ch originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then power@@ fully invested in order to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a tough@@ er issue . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P publishing period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of 30 million euros . &quot;
&quot; and although Plat@@ ini has fallen from the pres@@ idency in 2015 , his UEF@@ A successor , Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in , will continue to sc@@ are away from excessive expenditure . &quot;
&quot; certainly FF@@ P is not dead and we will surely strengthen the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , opposite The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for billing over the duration of its contract . &quot;
&quot; for the next five years , N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract , which can be accounted for by 4@@ 4.4 million euros in the financial statements for the next five years . &quot;
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has hit PS@@ G along with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the tough@@ est sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G received a fine of € 60 million ( then 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players . &quot;
UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that might try to beat out their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their revenues by companies associated with the owners of a club .
&quot; while a cat@@ fish company could sponsor the PS@@ G , if the value of sponsorship should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not be regarded as legitimate income . &quot;
&quot; exactly this happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the P@@ SA sponsorship deal was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority . &quot;
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G Pay@@ ments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come on payments from the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have argued that N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s World Cup will be held and such a maneu@@ ver for the UEF@@ A regulatory authorities could be easy to figure out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the existing sanctions against PS@@ G mean that UEF@@ A will be more attentive to respect each attempt to circum@@ vent the rules . &quot;
&quot; UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation . &quot;
they talked about the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press because they were not authorized to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 has achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
the accounts for the last fiscal year still need to be published .
&quot; PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals , merchan@@ dising and jer@@ sey selling . &quot;
the association assumes that sales will increase by at least 30 percent after signing the contract .
&quot; the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s move by claiming that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; said the president of the La League , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar &apos;s last ownership of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al @-@ manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American sports ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La League against a state financed by an association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; as soon as a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it will be very difficult to respect the financial Fair@@ play because you have different paths or have different interests , if a country has such a big actor to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new car supplier
&quot; in recent years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y board chocolate has produced chocolate for Swiss . &quot;
now the sweet co @-@ operation is in front of a possible end : the airline re@@ writes the order .
Swiss @-@ speaking writer Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed on request of the news agency s@@ da a corresponding report from the newspaper &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; of Friday .
&quot; according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 . &quot;
the products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the spokesperson . &quot;
around 17 million small red @-@ white packed chocolate tablets to 14 grams spread per year the flight atten@@ d@@ ants before landing to the passengers .
the Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs .
&quot; industry insi@@ ders estimate the volume of orders in accordance with &quot; &quot; North West Switzerland &quot; &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs . &quot;
but more important is the advertising effect : for a chocolate manufacturer it is a prestigious order .
&quot; as many applicants are in the new ten@@ dering process , Swiss does not want to give away . &quot;
&quot; in question , however , only Swiss manufacturers come into question . &quot;
&quot; according to the newspaper article , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the Treaty on the Spring 2018 . &quot;
&quot; for the s@@ da , the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not achiev@@ able for an opinion . &quot;
&quot; since 2006 , Swiss Life has been distributing cho@@ col@@ ates on board their flights . &quot;
Barry C@@ alle@@ baut had delivered the chocolate tablets before the Swiss contract concluded a contract with the daughter of Mig@@ ros .

nostal@@ gia goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
&quot; this repetition of the story is at the same time nostal@@ gic for the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ s , for the 90 @-@ year @-@ gr@@ unge era ( when the pre @-@ think@@ ers David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter the Sk@@ etch @-@ comedy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for itself - that is , for 2001 before their stars , such as Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd , went to bigger things . &quot;
&quot; as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories . &quot;
&quot; but as fran@@ chise , it feels like the time would be scar@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not just because of its absurd lob@@ ster ( it contained an original story for a promising tin vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;
&quot; by dividing up to the core of the g@@ ags - middle @-@ aged actors play cool children , who will grow up - they still managed to win the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es back . &quot;
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with its adults who are now adults , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and its par@@ o@@ dy goes more after the watering can principle , among them a riff on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ th years such as &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le &quot; ( &quot; The Hand Pain@@ ting the cra@@ dle &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; at one point , a character brow@@ ses through an Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the lovely C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Marino ) still hasn &apos;t lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy evil plot included in the Ron@@ ald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good good impression by Michael Ian Black ) .
&quot; as always , the ex@@ ams are the best part of the fran@@ chise . &quot;
&quot; it is especially fun to see the eternal young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons &apos;s sub@@ li@@ pp@@ age of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former big @-@ man @-@ on @-@ camp Andy feels like an old naked cra@@ cker . &quot;
&quot; there are the moments of accidental ma@@ dness that might inc@@ ur this fran@@ chise as a sort of repeti@@ tive &quot; &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; &quot; series until he reaches that which I consider as his logical conclusion : &quot; wet Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the gang of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon is now reminiscent of a different kind of nostal@@ gia : to revi@@ ve the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with its East @-@ West @-@ West ring @-@ fighting icon@@ ography . &quot;
&quot; the comedy with Rh@@ ys Thomas created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka is to be a bound TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est , who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the path of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism . &quot;
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alogues are synchron@@ ized by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also an exec@@ utable producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice G@@ ags to see ( the police sp@@ ends the time watching chess on TV how Americans might do it with football ) .
&quot; and the list of famous speakers , including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &quot; Fin@@ de the voice out . &quot; &quot;
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a killer who we@@ ars a Re@@ agan &apos;s mask is involved - that it often plays like a single .
&quot; with six long episodes , it is moving , and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , who was re@@ di@@ ted to a lower length , could better deliver his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , since Greg@@ ory and I@@ os@@ ef frequently visit the American embassy whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot;
the message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything possible for food .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even do it with our own younger history and with thei@@ rs .
strike against Dru@@ gs Ma@@ fia in the Land
the police took a blow against the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on Wednesday morning in the Black Forest Ba@@ ar circle , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Constance , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , numerous objects were searched , as the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office told Kon@@ stanz on Friday . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , 15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 , and arrest warran@@ ts had already been issued against them . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the officials secured greater quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms and several hundred thousand Euros . &quot;
&quot; in the case of simultaneous ra@@ ids in Italy , two people were arrested . &quot;
&quot; against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans , there were German arrest warran@@ ts . &quot;
the two are therefore probably extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the action .
&quot; in total , over 300 polic@@ emen were deployed . &quot;
&quot; the Ma@@ fia members are accused of organised crime crime , violent acts of violence , committed murder as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor has established Kon@@ stanz against organised drug trafficking in southern Germany . &quot;
between the public prosec@@ utor in Constance and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily .
&quot; therefore , the large @-@ scale operation on Wednesday morning was accompanied by four officials from Palermo . &quot;
the aim of the investigation was mainly Italian nation@@ als with close relation to the Italian ma@@ fia .
&quot; a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the bank account . &quot;
how to lam@@ ent large gaps in the for@@ eig@@ ner register
&quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not appear &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the for@@ eig@@ ner register in Germany has significant short@@ com@@ ings . &quot;
this leads to some serious mis@@ decisions in the case of asylum procedures .
&quot; according to a media report , the Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es Management of the German Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , drew attention to large gaps in the Central Registry . &quot;
&quot; defici@@ encies in the data recorded there may lead to &quot; &quot; serious mis@@ decisions &quot; &quot; in case of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , in an analysis similar to the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the Register , ten million people with foreign nationality are recorded in the register , including about 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU states . &quot;
the data is therefore managed by approximately 600 foreign @-@ country authorities in Germany .
&quot; because the data had not been sufficiently maintained , the data quality in parts has not been good until now . &quot;
&quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 have been found , &quot; by people who are no longer alive , or by citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer show up in the register . &quot;
&quot; incorrect data entries can slow reverse processes considerably , &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in the statistics of paid people , EU citizens are also included who would not have to leave . &quot;
&quot; such false classi@@ fications , however , led to a distorted debate on how to deal with paid @-@ off costs , &quot; it says in the analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the Federal Government has obviously begun sending refugee families back to Italy with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children when they are left there . &quot;
&quot; this comes from an internal paper issued by the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rück@@ er Zeitung . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the paper , &quot; &quot; BA@@ MF conduc@@ ts such procedures &quot; &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and infants - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 it was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper was referring to the difficult situation on the spot . &quot;
&quot; after the Dublin agreement , refugees from the EU state are responsible for achieving them first . &quot;
&quot; if a migrant is travelling to another EU country , this state can send it back to the country of origin . &quot;
&quot; the ministry is now writing : &quot; in the meantime , the recording capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy has considerably increased . &quot;
Italy has given guarantees for the reception and accommodation of family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EC@@ rt@@ HR ) considers these commitments enough .
other EU states would also send refugees back in the framework of the Dublin agreement .
&quot; the internal political spokes@@ woman of the left @-@ wing faction in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children are threatening the conditions of shooting conditions and a threat to child welfare because of the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system . &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Upper Austria provided blood donation service for other people .
at least from the twelve citizens who were honoured on Friday .
&quot; Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who now has 100 donations in the meantime , shared 50 litres of blood . &quot;
&quot; traditionally , the congregation has the multiple readiness to don@@ ate blood at the joint session of the Municipal Council . &quot;
&quot; it is brilliant how our body is created for it and we pay respect to the don@@ ors that make their blood available to strangers , still un@@ sel@@ fish , &quot; under@@ lined Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; one single blood donation helps several people , &quot; explained the District Director of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the cann@@ ed are broken down into their components . &quot;
&quot; in this way , three people could profit from a blood donation . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , corn makers reported about the actions carried out in the spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; said the DR@@ K District Team . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the change to the theatre house led to higher number of participants a few years ago . &quot;
&quot; before that Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Stra@@ w@@ berry t@@ amed to the multi@@ f@@ unders and were awarded for 50 donated blood donations . &quot;
&quot; half as many promised Herbert M@@ air and Dor@@ othe@@ e Ri@@ exc@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stef@@ anie St@@ oll and Uwe Vet@@ ter gave each 500 milli@@ liter of their life @-@ juice each . &quot;
the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation damp@@ ened speculation over a rise .
the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; when it retained the interest rates on family income in the midst of boo@@ sting pressure .
&quot; the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted for 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members to increase in this month because weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in its quar@@ terly inflation forecast , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and to 1.6 % for 2018 and warned that the pressure on domestic income would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in the fall . &quot;
but it sign@@ alized that in the next few years interest increases would be necessary to brid@@ le the inflation heated by Bre@@ x@@ it and she said that the bor@@ rowing costs may have to rise more than expected on the financial markets .
&quot; the members also agreed to withdraw part of the Mam@@ mot@@ h economic stimulus package , which was published one year after the Bre@@ x@@ it . &quot;
&quot; it will demand time for the financial plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks from next February , although it is expected that it will now provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC , GDP will remain weak at short notice , as pressure on the real income of households continues to burden consumption . &quot;
&quot; on the interest rates , it repeated that &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; would be necessary to cool inflation and a &quot; slightly larger &quot; scale than the markets expect . &quot;
the markets currently forecast the first rise in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; however , the Bank emphasized that elev@@ ations would be &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; limited &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s growth forecasts for this and next year are projected to rise by 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared with the forecast in May .
it has retained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
&quot; according to these news , Po@@ und fell to the dollar and the euro . &quot;
&quot; the pound dropped by 0,5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros . &quot;
&quot; the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ed rising expectations on interest rates , and GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % has risen to 0.3 % in the previous three months . &quot;
&quot; growth in the third quarter is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will recover slightly after the Bank at the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the latest inflation forecast offered little enthusiasm for households who are affected by increasing inflation and minor salary increases , as the tigh@@ tening is still worse before it gets better . &quot;
&quot; she added that monetary policy in the coming years cannot &quot; &quot; prevent income departure , &quot; &quot; but she added that the wages at the end of their three @-@ year forecast are &quot; &quot; clear &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the economy is also strengthened by the rising demand for British goods , which is attributable to the weak Po@@ und , which will compensate for a portion of lower consumption expenditure . &quot;
the decision comes one year after lowering interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote that caused the sin@@ king of the fun@@ nel .
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years to fully achieve the prices and the economy .
&quot; before the Bank &apos;s last judgment on interest rates , the call for interest rates has risen since inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three political decision @-@ makers in July demanding an increase to 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; inflation has dropped from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said it was expected to attract them again in the coming months . &quot;
&quot; the Bank said that the excess in relation to its target of 2 % would be &quot; &quot; wholly &quot; &quot; to the weak Po@@ und . &quot;
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ la@@ ins , director of Cor@@ eco Mort@@ gage Bro@@ ker , said : &quot; given the recent decline in swap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive again , as the credi@@ tors are looking for businesses and want to end the year in a positive manner . &quot;
&quot; the market is particularly good for those in which the existing deals are running out and the new mort@@ g@@ ages finish , and many with toll free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot;
&quot; N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) should prescri@@ be 10,000 people controversial &quot;
patients will receive access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment in September following a fight before the High Court against the financing of the drug in N@@ HS .
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that a pre @-@ exposure proph@@ yla@@ xis received before sexual intercourse ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by some 86 percent , is now delivered by the health service through a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appe@@ al confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court last year , according to which the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that local authorities should finance it . &quot;
&quot; the chess train announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England head Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; , &quot; while the National AIDS Trust ( NA@@ T ) described this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to enable registration of people , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced to all over England in April 2018 . &quot;
pre@@ exposure proph@@ yla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV drugs taken before sex in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces the HIV transmission in infection risk .
taking pre@@ p before sexual intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse .
&quot; those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated . &quot;
&quot; in hospitals suitable participants will be identified , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot;
people living in England and registered with a GP may also register for a possible participation at their local participating sex clinic .
the program will sign up £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to deliver the medicines this week after an international sourcing .
&quot; the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting clinical evidence , how it is used , recorded and implemented on a large scale . &quot;
&quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should supplement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot;
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in cop@@ ing with one of humanity &apos;s biggest health challenges . &quot;
&quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National AIDS Trust ) , said : &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ p , if targeted towards needy and endangered people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded experiment in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives . &quot;
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , Chairman of the Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; the priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind . &quot;
&quot; now that pre@@ p test medicine has been obtained , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 infected people . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , Minister of Defense , said : &quot; &quot; the start of the pre@@ p process is welcomed and over@@ due after months of delay and hes@@ itation by the government . &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; now , it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV , and that they will contribute to the completion of the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
living the Great Life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks turned this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , moved from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment in 2014 . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne didn &apos;t pack her bags and sold her bags .
&quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much bigger room , &quot; Jo@@ anne says . &quot;
I looked for something comparable to my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and she had the same high ceilings .
I fell in love with them and made an offer on that day . &quot;
&quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely refurbished . &quot;
originally a one @-@ bedroom property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Jo@@ anne wanted to add storage space and an mezzanine to optimally use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , plenty of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my request , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed of Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use 12.@@ 5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms over one another , so that the architectural challenge consisted in creating an mezzanine where you could stand . &quot;
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the issue .
&quot; the steel works are quite complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stack@@ ed on top of each other , without having to bend . &quot;
&quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama .
&quot; for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area . &quot;
&quot; mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and Vintage ser@@ ge mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
&quot; at both ends , a short corridor is mirr@@ ored in order to let it work longer . &quot;
&quot; in the kitchen , the mirr@@ oring feels like a window into another room . &quot;
&quot; at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units offer space for all the cutlery and j@@ ars of Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used . &quot;
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering art went inside , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot;
&quot; it is counter @-@ important , so that when you slide the door , it is very easy to gli@@ de . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the floor size . &quot;
&quot; here , they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and therefore help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t fall into the electrical outlets in the walls .
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself by good design and increased square footage of slightly standard in something quite amazing .
&quot; in fact , as Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave this not . &quot;
brothers struggling for a 500 million US dollar real estate empire
&quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in an argument about one of the largest real estate imperialist Victori@@ as worth over $ 500 million . &quot;
&quot; the former director of Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to reti@@ re from family business since 2014 , but a sharp debate on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , accumulated since the 1973 family bought a shop at Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot;
&quot; there , the West@@ co family founded jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores . &quot;
it was sold for $ 85 million in 1999 .
&quot; this money was invested in real estate , and De Lu@@ tis &apos;s portfolio now includes offices in the city center , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler , as well as m@@ alls in the suburbs . &quot;
&quot; following an agreement with her late father , Col@@ in was described by Paul as &quot; &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; &quot; in the family De Lu@@ tis - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third . &quot;
a court record states that Col@@ in owns property worth $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul worth $ 17@@ 6 million .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; the det@@ ach@@ ments proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I considered the best objects , &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it . &quot;
&quot; last Friday , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place after several failed attempts . &quot;
&quot; the Brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business , of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims , have ruled him out . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but th@@ rows Paul forward to manage some possessions in@@ competent . &quot;
&quot; in an early Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it , which was filed by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian inheritance dict@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the costs increase in the event , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and from both sides held law firms . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her dec@@ eased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran dairy @-@ bars and delic@@ at@@ essen deals from the late 1950s , and in the early se@@ ven@@ ties bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick . &quot;
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property where Col@@ in opened the family &apos;s first jeans shop .
&quot; Col@@ in says he started &quot; &quot; West@@ co &quot; &quot; when he was &quot; &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass on their property to their sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis Group , where Col@@ in claims that Mark was paid $ 10 million in leaving the company and Luke 26 million . &quot;
&quot; both Luke and Mark were , &quot; Paul says about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
Col@@ in was very with@@ held although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography of 2015 Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire was the best friend of the TV stars .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; only Col@@ in answered by SMS , to say &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say much , &quot; &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot;
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to su@@ e me and draw our sur@@ name through the courts , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in writing to the court that he tried to meet his brother &apos;s demands . &quot;
&quot; our father didn &apos;t want Paul and I would end up in our current fight , &quot; &quot; he said and added that he &quot; &quot; still hoping for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Friday , this hope seemed to be over . &quot;
&quot; our affair will be resolved by the courts in the near future , &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot;
Tru@@ mp@@ s new Chief of Staff plans to restrict the media abst@@ in@@ ence of the President .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
&quot; Politi@@ co reports that the White House Chief of Staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Tru@@ mp , including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more dis@@ counted rate . &quot;
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the White House &apos;s new Chief of Staff , met with senior employees on his first working day , he presented a major problem in President Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s White House that he wanted to repair : poor information falling into the president &apos;s hands . &quot;
Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would obtain good information .
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense but others have tried to t@@ ame Tru@@ mp by monitoring its media diet .
&quot; President Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s relationship with television goes back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong . &quot;
&quot; if candidate Tru@@ mp was anno@@ yed because of unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of jobs that were convincing , &quot; said the former election advis@@ er Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February against Politi@@ co . &quot;
&quot; Politi@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; the key to keeping Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter habit under control , according to six ex @-@ election officials , insi@@ sts that his personal media consumption includes a steady lob@@ b@@ ying price . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter habit was ever under control is ridi@@ culous .
perhaps these campaign officials know something we don &apos;t know - that Tru@@ mp@@ s twe@@ ets would have contained even more fuel without their intervention .
we will probably never know anything about twe@@ ets that Tru@@ mp hasn &apos;t sent .
&quot; if his collabor@@ ators have already managed to keep anno@@ y@@ ance from him several times , their efforts have paid off . &quot;
but no one has to consistently prevent Tru@@ mp &apos;s controversy .
&quot; part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Tru@@ mp material that potentially fo@@ sters their views from the world . &quot;
&quot; Politi@@ co - very concerned with this history - reported in May about the advis@@ ers &apos; preference , to give the president dou@@ bt@@ ful information to the president for strategic reasons . &quot;
this was an example described by re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former tru@@ mp officials say that Tru@@ mp can react to negative press cuts like a volcano , especially those with leak@@ y ch@@ equ@@ es , and that he insi@@ sts on finding out where they come from . &quot;
&quot; this was exactly what happened at the end of February , when someone mali@@ ci@@ ously announced a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet prov@@ ok@@ ate@@ urs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh to be &quot; the source behind a he@@ ap of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter for ch@@ ic@@ anes , or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has expressed false accus@@ ations in the past and rev@@ oked them . &quot;
Tru@@ mp was reading the article and started asking employees about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; Gold@@ smith added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , tried to implement a system in order to manage and document the paper@@ work that Tru@@ mp received . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly attempts three months later to do the same .
&quot; perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tru@@ mp is still his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ers are still striving for influence . &quot;
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
most sought @-@ after criminals receive mail from Euro@@ pol
&quot; since the address is unknown , the help of the people is raised and hoped . &quot;
the police throughout Europe sends in this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards to dangerous criminals .
&quot; as the addresses of the sought @-@ after criminals are not known in nature , information from the population will be raised and asked . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Euro@@ pol issued an announcement that follows the &quot; &quot; EU Most W@@ an@@ ted &quot; &quot; Advent cal@@ endar@@ s from the winter . &quot;
&quot; the experiences would have shown that many fle@@ eting places hide from holiday destinations , it was called Euro@@ pol . &quot;
there are 21 post@@ cards for searched criminals from 21 EU countries .
&quot; since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the online @-@ searched could have been arrested so far , at least eleven of them based on evidence after the publication on the website . &quot;
travellers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; Million@@ aire &apos;s Series &apos;
&quot; some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are again with some resol@@ ute travellers on the foot of the war , who have negotiated a burial place drawn by the municipality in order to rec@@ la@@ im a field in front of their man@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; the passengers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ avans on a field outside a wealthy street of Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; Million@@ aire @-@ Series . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they brought horses , babies and an army of v@@ ans after they were thrown out in May , but without being deter@@ red by the dit@@ ch dug by the council to prevent their incur@@ sions . &quot;
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense posts and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; angry residents have pushed the advice of Soli@@ hull , who said it is &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot;
an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said : &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley He@@ ath where they threw stones on the pedestri@@ ans .
&quot; the Council has to be forced into action by shame , as it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot;
&quot; the travellers were there in May , were moved forward and are now back . &quot;
&quot; more came last night , probably even more today . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long teachings to protect their parks . &quot;
I live on the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my church tax if the Council can &apos;t even stop it .
&quot; a local people who didn &apos;t want to be called said : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , we &apos;ve just seen the last round of these travellers only to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round . &quot;
the numbers have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the park area . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of the Soli@@ hull Council said : &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the land beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ hull . we take the necessary legal steps so that they can move on as quickly as possible . &quot;
&quot; in order to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many people as possible notify an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101 . &quot;
this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we submit our case .
&quot; from Bir@@ k@@ enhof , Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise becomes &quot;
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise becomes the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof .
the house in front of the gates of Freuden@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; because with the closing of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof due to the then Ambiente operating company mbH on 13 April 2014 , some 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and also income through the tourist tax . &quot;
&quot; in the fall of 2014 , in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who came to the district , the hotel building was offered as a collective shelter for controversial discussions . &quot;
the city prevented the placing of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time in the municipal council .
but especially Freuden@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian Os@@ s@@ wald was defending the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties in the house .
he should be right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels with managing director Birgit Sch@@ erer based in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a home of the three @-@ star Plus Categ@@ ory under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freuden@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
&quot; hot Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; at the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof , construction sh@@ utt@@ les have been standing in front of the entrance for quite some time , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear what extensive renov@@ ations are made . &quot;
&quot; the floors were torn out , ceilings partly broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
&quot; until March , there is still much to do . &quot;
&quot; it is actually a nice place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are built @-@ in . &quot;
&quot; everything should later become &quot; &quot; beautifully bourgeois &quot; , &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room are part of the equipment . &quot;
&quot; one does not want to be positioned at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on an up@@ scale inner city level , Sch@@ erer emphasized . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to be broad@@ ly set up , explains Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; he has already led talks with O@@ B Julian Os@@ s@@ wald and tourism director Michael Kr@@ ause , so Sch@@ erer . &quot;
the city &apos;s performances are identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; after the amount of investment required , Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to define exactly what he wants . &quot;
&quot; just under one million euros , he calcul@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; the external systems are also brought to the front @-@ man , which is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in a courtyard there is a large terrace , which will be accessible from the restaurant which is open to public . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freuden@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ air : us Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator sets up Grand Jury
&quot; in the Russia affair for US President Donald Tru@@ mp , special investig@@ ators Robert Mu@@ eller should have appointed a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report . &quot;
&quot; in recent weeks , the committee has taken up the work , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; on appeal to people entrusted with the matter . &quot;
the paper evaluated the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller extended and intensified his investigation .
the channel CN@@ N reported that there were already first inv@@ itations to the Gre@@ mi@@ ums in connection with a meeting between Tru@@ mp@@ s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. secret services accused the Krem@@ lin for a long time interfer@@ ing in the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller investig@@ ates whether there were agreements between Tru@@ mp@@ s election campaign team and Moscow .
&quot; in the focus of the investigations , several men shall stand who acted as advis@@ ers to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the election campaign . &quot;
&quot; according to reports , Mu@@ eller took a close look at more and more Tru@@ mp@@ s in a private and business environment . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Washington Post , &quot; a few weeks ago , wrote that the special agent Tru@@ mp has personally moved to the centre and investig@@ ates whether the President may have hin@@ dered the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the wake of the affair . &quot;
Grand Jury &apos;s main task is to examine the present evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether prosecution should be charged .
Grand Jur@@ as@@ says are therefore also called accus@@ ations .
&quot; most of the time , they are turned on when dealing with larger and controversial cases . &quot;
the process always takes place behind closed doors .
the Board can also be turned on by the public prosec@@ utor to charge persons under oath .
&quot; according to the CN@@ N channel , inv@@ itations have already been issued which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tru@@ mp J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
&quot; people who participated in the meeting were called on to a statement , it was said in the report . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they should provide documents . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Tru@@ mp J@@ r. was also Tru@@ mp@@ s Ad@@ visor and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner , as well as his great election chief Paul Man@@ a@@ fort . &quot;
&quot; legal experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the introduction show that Mu@@ eller would not let himself be in@@ timi@@ dated in his work , and that if necessary , he would act quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the collection of an indictment . &quot;
&quot; however , the introduction of the Gre@@ mi@@ um is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new revelations , on Thursday evening , the president used a speech in West Virginia to portra@@ y the Russia affair as a campaign of its political opponents . &quot;
&quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; the subject will give the democr@@ ats a chance to &quot; feel good , &quot; because they don &apos;t have anything else they can talk about . &quot;
his special advis@@ er T@@ y Cob@@ b stated in a statement that he did not know anything about the setting up of a Grand Jury .
&quot; but he also usually works in secret , he stressed . &quot;
the White House endor@@ ses all measures that ha@@ st@@ ened the work of the Special Inter@@ medi@@ ator in a &quot; fair &quot; way .
the former F@@ BI chief James Com@@ ey said three times that not against the president .
&quot; one has no reason to assume that something has changed , it was said in the explanation . &quot;
but Mu@@ eller was only used after Tru@@ mp Com@@ ey had fired Com@@ ey .
&quot; because of this r@@ amp@@ utation , accus@@ ations against Tru@@ mp have become loud , he did not want to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; in June , Com@@ ey , in front of a Senate committee , asked for a setting of investigations against the then national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n . &quot;
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
&quot; after the presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the special agent and its staff . &quot;
this triggered spec@@ ulations on whether Tru@@ mp Mu@@ eller wanted to release Mu@@ eller .
&quot; unlike an independent special agent of the Congress , such as the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair , for the later President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theoretically be recru@@ ited by the President of the Ministry of Justice . &quot;
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
&quot; two groups of republi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators presented legislation on Thursday , after which the special agent could no longer be dismissed . &quot;
Antar@@ cti@@ ca : gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg drives in Antar@@ cti@@ ca
&quot; in the Western Antar@@ ctic , a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg has been replaced by the scar@@ cely seven @-@ fold size of Berlin by the Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s . &quot;
this shared the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
&quot; the Kol@@ oss , which weighs more than one tri@@ l@@ lion and 5@@ 800 square kilometres , is now driving north and will probably need two , three years until it mel@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the biggest ice gi@@ ants that researchers have registered in the past three decades . &quot;
there is no danger for people from him .
&quot; as far as climate change has played a role in the decline of the ic@@ e@@ berg , research data is unclear . &quot;
&quot; in total , however , there have been a series of unusual break@@ through@@ s in the region for about 30 years , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in a fac@@ tual background . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , this can be related to global warming . &quot;
the now broken col@@ os@@ sus has been part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s so far .
Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by large glaci@@ ers .
it continues to grow into the sea and regularly erup@@ ts .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is located south of South America almost at the head of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
&quot; to the north of this closing ceremony , the balance of wa@@ xing and breaking was disturbed several years ago . &quot;
A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen writes a complete sch@@ el@@ meal there .
&quot; some argue that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is in danger , because the front edge has never been as far back as it is currently . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the ice sheet stands under tension and can collapse , if a piece is broken down at a key point . &quot;
melting of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s and Eis@@ berg does not increase sea level as they float on the water and pus@@ hes ice as much water as it results after melting .
&quot; however , the loss of the shell@@ ac causes the glaci@@ ers to flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase sea level , but only to a small extent , writes the British research project on the observation of Antar@@ cti@@ ca ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot;
&quot; according to A@@ WI data with nearly 50 000 square kilometres , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is the fourth largest Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s of the Antar@@ ctic . &quot;
&quot; at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters . &quot;
there it breaks down on a regular basis .
&quot; although it is a natural occurrence and no direct connection to climate change is aware , the ice shield now comes to a more dangerous position , &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the longest retreat since the beginning of records , &quot; he also confirmed . &quot;
&quot; scientists argued that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s would now grow back or go back in the long term and possibly collapse , said his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
&quot; even if these scientists do not rep@@ el the demo@@ li@@ tion of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg to climate change , in the past decades many ice blocks of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have fallen apart . &quot;
this long skirt of the Antar@@ ctic stretches towards South America .
&quot; according to data from the research program British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s . &quot;
the decline in temperature contributed to the decline .
&quot; the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has been heated by about three degrees in the last 50 years , making it one of the areas in which the temperature rises the fastest . &quot;
CD@@ U wants to have Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f at staff
&quot; because it is becoming increasingly difficult to occupy vac@@ ant positions , the CD@@ U calls out to come out of the employer &apos;s association to become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; only shortly before the summer break , 41 new positions have been linked to the administration . &quot;
more than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
&quot; now , 17 trainees have their first day of work behind them . &quot;
the teachers at the circle are obviously very sought after .
around 6@@ 20 applications were recorded for the places to be awarded this year .
&quot; however , the circle continues to lack staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks . &quot;
&quot; at present , there are still 50 un@@ occupied places in the M@@ ett@@ mann district . &quot;
&quot; among other things , we are looking for doctors and engineers , as well as the forces of general administration . &quot;
&quot; together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG , the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration . &quot;
&quot; according to the parties &quot; wish , the administration should develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to not only cover short @-@ term needs of skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented candidate shortage . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should be oriented internally and extern@@ ally , demonstrate concrete measures for cross @-@ clim@@ bers and involve an education offensive , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
it sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personal problems that you didn &apos;t know before .
other cities adverti@@ se good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
the speech is from a real &quot; competition of public employers . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a high number of employees who ex@@ crete illness or age related to the service come out of the service . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is time for action so that there will be no more jobs un@@ occupied . &quot;
&quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter Pe@@ op@@ les , Head of Group of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the joint request with his party . &quot;
&quot; he took care of a big surprise already in the cra@@ cking @-@ day , when he publicly challenged the personnel costs and amazed the other parties . &quot;
people want all possibilities to be verified that enable a withdrawal from the communal Emplo@@ yers &apos; Federation .
&quot; if we do not come short @-@ term to a satisfying solution , the county council should aim with the trade unions - perhaps in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - a Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f , &quot; says the peoples . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the CD@@ U is trying to better pay the employees and officials when it actually envis@@ ages the tari@@ ff bill for the public service . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries are currently prescribed exactly , increases or more money only exist if one changes to a higher level , which is oriented towards career years . &quot;
but the tasks of the circle have grown steadily over the past few years .
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitute protection law . &quot;
&quot; not least due to the increasing number of asylum seekers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too few personnel . &quot;
Italy tigh@@ tens the tone to NGO migrant lif@@ ebo@@ ats
&quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs that are using rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , that they are not allowed to continue this if they do not comply with new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot;
&quot; Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came one day after the Italian authorities confis@@ cated a boat from the German Relief Organisation &quot; &quot; Youth Ret@@ tet &quot; &quot; because their crew worked effectively with traffi@@ ckers in a manner that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration . &quot;
&quot; the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for one year , refused to comment on the Italian prosec@@ utor &apos;s Amb@@ ro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ sio . &quot;
&quot; we are sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; said the organization in a statement on social media . &quot;
we can only judge any accus@@ ations that are currently being raised after we have collected all the information and can judge the situation .
&quot; the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of &apos; Jugend Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , since October . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that its crew is taking din@@ gh@@ y migrants aboard , which are delivered to them directly by traffi@@ ckers , and that the smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can ab@@ ort so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one such meeting was allegedly held only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the Act of the Prosecutor , whose content was published by Italian media . &quot;
&quot; the occupation is suspected of over@@ throwing the authority of the Italian Co@@ ast@@ guard , the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives . &quot;
&quot; under the code of conduct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta must have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue missions have so far agreed to keep the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable as they would not bring any &quot; significant changes or obstruc@@ tions &quot; to their rescue operations . &quot;
among those who refuse to sign is Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate organization Doc@@ tors With@@ out Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; Minn@@ iti said meanwhile that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures in Italy has declined sharply in recent weeks , indicating that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guards and the cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit . &quot;
&quot; in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; there were plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe . &quot;
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
&quot; nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bi@@ kers , the &quot; Berliner out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met at Wach@@ en@@ heim in the northern pf@@ al@@ z for four days to enjoy Tri@@ als and Si@@ ghts . &quot;
&quot; for this , three friendly guides were available . &quot;
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est from Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim during hot summer temperatures .
&quot; view@@ points followed , partly on towers , from which one could look far beyond the Pal@@ at@@ inate Forest and the up@@ stream planes . &quot;
in between there were always longer asc@@ ents for the long tri@@ als .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and to the folk festival Wur@@ st@@ markt .
&quot; again , there was a lookout spot connected by &quot; &quot; flo@@ ated &quot; &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; on the last two days , many altitude meters were announced . &quot;
&quot; caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and refu@@ ges brought welcome breaks . &quot;
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers inhal@@ ed br@@ ine in the open air inhal@@ atorium .
Neu@@ stadt was also controlled .
&quot; after 17@@ 3 kilometres and almost 4@@ 500 metres altitude , the group met the P@@ fäl@@ zer Wald from its best side - sporty and cul@@ turally . &quot;
console instead of grass - Bundes@@ liga equi@@ ps itself for e @-@ sports
are the sports stars in the future sitting in front of computer consoles instead of being swe@@ at@@ y by wind and weather over the stadium racing ?
&quot; fact : e @-@ sport has long become a serious business , a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gau@@ ges included . &quot;
these have also recognised the first federal li@@ ga@@ des that are increasingly involved in this field .
&quot; the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , followed by the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sports department in mid @-@ July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 . &quot;
&quot; we hope to enth@@ use new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; he is sure , &quot; &quot; that many clubs still climb on this train . &quot;
&quot; next weekend , the FIFA World Cup organizes the first &quot; &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; &quot; in London , where gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; apart from Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven qualified for example . &quot;
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in E @-@ sport .
the Ex @-@ Trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds , that young people will still go into the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and : the clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets , especially the Asian ones . &quot;
&quot; with prominent e @-@ athletes under contract , one could be more often present on these markets online more often than once a year to send the Bundes@@ liga to Asia . &quot;
what is it all about ?
&quot; in E @-@ Sport , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or the football simulation FIFA are being challenged at competition level . &quot;
&quot; as in normal sports , they have long established le@@ agues in which the pros compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; and by 2022 , E @-@ Sport is already part of the official programme . &quot;
but is it really a kind of sport ?
&quot; for many , the idea is certain to get used to . &quot;
also In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ous has long dealt with the question .
&quot; for the professor at the German Sports College in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical reactions that can be found in classical sport - for example , increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it requires cognitive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and rapid response . &quot;
professional gam@@ ers should not only train on the console but also their bodies and pay attention to nutrition .
&quot; the fit player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; however , rob@@ atics also have problems : &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a topic . &quot;
&quot; checks should be difficult for online games , and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing . &quot;
the scientist highlights the high integr@@ ative effect of E @-@ Sports .
&quot; players are internationally on the move , that &apos;s like a big global family , there are no intercultural obstacles . &quot;
a study by the management consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Bundes@@ verband Interactive Entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth in e @-@ sports .
&quot; in 2016 more than 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments . &quot;
sales are expected to be 130 million in three years .
&quot; against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the football Bundes@@ liga , this is little . &quot;
&quot; however , the e @-@ sport is not far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hockey , &quot; writes the Del@@ o@@ itte couns@@ ell@@ ors . &quot;
many countries have already passed internationally .
&quot; great markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the US Team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports . &quot;
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport @-@ betting provider Uni@@ kr@@ n .
there is a lot going on in Europe as well .
&quot; in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport has been introduced as a teaching subject , says F@@ rob@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; according to D@@ utt , the football league clubs in the Netherlands and France are now obliged to set up an e @-@ sports department . &quot;
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany is la@@ gging behind , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B Director R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; only in nostal@@ gia to decay , and to clarify the old days , is not enough today . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but to align the company with the modern market at the same time . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digi@@ ti@@ zed world , &quot; says D@@ utt . &quot;
you can &apos;t cling to the fact that only football remains the same as it has always been .

Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter convic@@ ted of the texts that Con@@ rad Roy pushing for suicide
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend by texts and calls to commit suicide .
&quot; Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been exposed to prob@@ ation . &quot;
Car@@ ter was convic@@ ted in June because of negligence by Con@@ rad Roy on 13 July 2014 .
the father of Roy spoke on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is not comfor@@ ting .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to stay free until his appeal .
&quot; she had been confronted with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy have suffered from a mental illness . &quot;
&quot; dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood with tears in her eyes , with folded hands and downward pointing eyes when she was convic@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; their actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot;
she finished his life to make her own better .
&quot; she did not take any responsibility , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she has not shown any re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance which she depl@@ ores completely . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz , however , said he did not figure out that their &quot; age or maturity &quot; or even their mental disease have a significant influence on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a public prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is &quot; no day in which I do not steal the loss of my beloved Son . &quot;
&quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything . I try to be there for his sisters , despite all my pains that we will carry for eternity . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ya &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said she was &quot; &quot; persecuted by the knowledge &quot; &quot; that she would never take part in the wedding of her brother or be a@@ unt for his children . &quot;
&quot; no more this single person with whom I was together since my birth is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent , as there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to commit another to commit suicide . &quot;
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
&quot; the case drew national attention , after Car@@ ter &apos;s text message revealed that she encouraged him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; hang up , spring from a building , arise yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family . &quot;
&quot; in the moments before his suicide , she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing you have to do is turn off the generator , and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz told Car@@ ter &apos;s attention through the death of Roy and ordered them to benefit from the fall by some press .
the case has the legal opinion shared .
&quot; one of the few who defended the Car@@ ter was Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was convic@@ ted in 2007 for murder of her British room@@ mate in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Wit@@ ch : learning from the new mini @-@ L@@ ame of FC Bayern
&quot; that Joshua was allowed to run at the Audi Cup as a captain , is no accident . &quot;
the FC Bayern tr@@ es a big season to the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner - extra motivation does not hurt .
&quot; something was different in his place in the cabin , which Joshua saw Kim@@ che immediately , even if the extra piece of clothing was very , very small . &quot;
&quot; but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups did not take Philipp L@@ ame and also no Manuel Neu@@ er , he made his part in the arm . &quot;
&quot; the trainer had not announced it , &quot; &quot; told the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner afterwards , after his first use as Bavaria @-@ captain . &quot;
&quot; well , the one could have run better than at 0 : 2 versus the SS@@ C Naples . &quot;
but the sign from the coach could also hint me this way .
&quot; not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was chosen as a game leader in the C @-@ El@@ f &apos;s youth play@@ w@@ ners , de@@ but@@ ants and just out of the holiday . &quot;
sugar@@ s are best distributed to those who want to have a lot of herbs that you want to keep in your spirits .
&quot; those who were chosen to take part in the legacy of L@@ ame , can only use a little extra motivation . &quot;
&quot; Kim@@ i confirmed : &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old sat on the field as a mini @-@ L@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; at the right rear , that is his position , the white band@@ age on the arm did the rest . &quot;
&quot; and at all Kim@@ e worked in this initial formation like the one , who can take the helm at the very best . &quot;
&quot; he gave instructions , tried to direct the in@@ filtr@@ ated tro@@ upe . &quot;
&quot; he had the view of the whole , while many others were busy with themselves . &quot;
&quot; Vi@@ dal thereby to re@@ play his lack of fitness ( do not fold ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches thus , on the devil , come out to the services of the Asia @-@ journey ( fold also only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le with it , in their first appearance in Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ k@@ ot not neg@@ atively fall off . &quot;
&quot; after all , it worked quite well . &quot;
&quot; Sü@@ le ran beside Kim@@ i , Ru@@ dy in front of the defense , both acted sovereign . &quot;
&quot; the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli storm was often difficult , and Sü@@ le also tried a few times successfully in the game design . &quot;
&quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy admitted that the result was &quot; &quot; not as we hoped for . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance at the debut .
&quot; game reloc@@ ation , tempo change : &quot; for this style , I was also fet@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; as un@@ usually this Bavarian world is still for the newcom@@ ers , one saw in connection to the game . &quot;
&quot; for example Ru@@ dy did not have one or two in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but determined six or seven interviews . &quot;
Kim@@ i said after a few cris@@ p statements in the back of his new fellow players .
&quot; there he heard of Sü@@ le an interesting sentence : &quot; &quot; what is going on here , I have already noticed . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , you just have to win any game . &quot;
&quot; after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new anymore . &quot;

company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ con@@ t Tempo
&quot; it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still the Minister of Economics of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate . &quot;
this shows after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ ser ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V demand of a change in economic policy - and simultaneously charge the old Minister .
&quot; Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer Busin@@ esses ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; Wis@@ ser takes up the wishes of the economy , which Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot;
the largest turn@@ around is of course in infrastructure policy : the gap between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s priority list .
&quot; this year , the ministry hopes for a planning procedure until 2021 is to stand construction law . &quot;
&quot; the West Bank also plays a role in the plans of the country , which is in the im@@ penet@@ r@@ able need of the federal communication plan . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to take the track in operation in December 2020 , says Minist@@ eri@@ ums@@ feld Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; nat@@ us sees in it a sign for supporting regional , but internationally competitive enterprises . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( Chamber of Commerce ) Trier stri@@ ves , as learned from Wis@@ ser , a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate @-@ Label , in order to increase sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of German wine exports that have been sag@@ ging for ten years . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Wis@@ ser has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , praise the Chamber of Industry . &quot;
&quot; the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier provides an additional incentive for young trainees in the new master bonus , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach . &quot;
a bonus of 1000 Euro for the passed master examination and 2500 Euros will be provided if graduates are able to become independent within ten years of the master &apos;s education .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; the planned road construction is fast facts , and at the same time it is out of the country with the necessary personnel , says Jan Glock@@ auer , head of the Chamber of Commerce of the Chamber of Commerce of Trier . &quot;
&quot; up to now , 56 new engineers , who want to employ Wis@@ ser for mobility , have only been occupied in 29 places . &quot;
the Chamber of Commerce also calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
&quot; commenting on the calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , CD@@ U fac@@ tional vice , Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf , points out more than 20 million euros less than proposed in the preservation of country roads in 2017 and 2018 . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frank nat@@ us also expects the country &apos;s concept to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region . &quot;
in@@ timi@@ dating is also the current broad@@ band expansion in the country .
&quot; in 2016 , regional companies had rated power supply in an I@@ HK survey only with a score of 3,@@ 4 . &quot;
they compla@@ ined about stagn@@ ant internet connections and break@@ downs .
&quot; former Minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke , on the other hand , is currently out of politics and is still sitting on the Supervisory Board of the wind power company Pro Wind . &quot;
&quot; the Green Group left Lem@@ ke on April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe , where after four months she has already cleared the field due to in@@ consist@@ encies . &quot;
Audi to change 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - autom@@ akers see themselves confronted with a counter reaction
&quot; one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW Group said that the company believes that &quot; &quot; there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions , &quot; &quot; and thus referred to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - to ban or limit diesel vehicles . &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described under@@ tak@@ ings as a recall .
European autom@@ akers have greatly promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; but nitrogen oxi@@ des , em@@ itting diesel engines , are considered carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma . &quot;
&quot; the cost of car manufacturers to install exhaust f@@ umes from diesel vehicles also increases , making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of indul@@ ging the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing the signs of the problem .
&quot; companies try to avoid Volkswagen mistakes , using so @-@ called off @-@ off devices that could regulate emissions to comply with regulations when a car was tested , but driving back under normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several Volkswagen employees were indic@@ ted , others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; last month , the former head of Ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be tried in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circum@@ vent emissions regulations in Europe , and a request that focused on the United States has been extended . &quot;
the involvement of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer bears dispro@@ portion@@ ately to Volkswagen &apos;s win .

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ n@@ asen and laughter against the suffering
&quot; Mor@@ di@@ llo was at times one of the most published cartoon characters , the bul@@ lies of his characters are his trademark . &quot;
&quot; even with 85 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an is still working on a film . &quot;
&quot; his message : &quot; &quot; laughter , &quot; &quot; because there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
&quot; in the first years as an artist , he , among other things , suggested himself as a drawer for congrat@@ ulation cards - which frustr@@ ated him . &quot;
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; &quot; he once said . &quot;
&quot; after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , he made his breakthrough at the end of the 60 &apos;s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in Paris Match , and then also in the &quot; Star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
&quot; again and again , the artist was inspired by cities . &quot;
&quot; large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo figures cav@@ ort in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning , according to his own data , he still sits on the drawing day , works daily almost ten hours a day . &quot;
&quot; on cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and watches , his funny figures continue to find a lot of spreading worldwide . &quot;
for six years he has been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters .
the protagon@@ ist in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousand foot@@ ball@@ ers as opponents .
&quot; for the first time , his characters speak in the 3D film , which should come to the cinema screen 2019 . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot;
the script is not written by him .
&quot; that &apos;s why he prefers to rely on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced without a word of word . &quot;
la@@ ven@@ der threatened by climate change
&quot; it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; la@@ ven@@ der is declining because of the conditions reminiscent of drought and because of the diseases transmitted insects , causing scientists and farmers trying to find solutions , great head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agricultural research institute CRI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; &quot; la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years , which in the spring brought much less rain and in autumn much more . &quot;
this has effects on the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
&quot; there is also a small zi@@ k@@ ade , a micro bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its d@@ warf cy@@ c@@ ads , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is a lot in the game .
&quot; la@@ ven@@ der oil does not only l@@ ure for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also very popular for perf@@ ume and cosmetics . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened . &quot;
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
&quot; the solutions taken into account include a better water distribution and slow@@ ing down evap@@ oration from the ground , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties which are more resistant to drought . &quot;

the murder of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
&quot; the employees of the weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet on Wedn@@ es@@ days to review their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars . &quot;
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security . &quot;
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what feels safer : they should take their children into the office , which were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them at home . &quot;
&quot; security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room : opponents , Neut@@ ral , Al@@ lies . &quot;
&quot; they ask the re@@ porters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary , percep@@ tions and abdominal feelings reach . &quot;
&quot; there are drug smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the salary list of the government or the cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no resp@@ ite of violence , and while the corp@@ ses are accum@@ ulating throughout the country , more and more journalists are here : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena Nie@@ to took office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are facing attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there were at least seven deaths in seven countries this year . &quot;
&quot; among the latter is her editor and her inspir@@ er by Ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot;
&quot; his absence is felt deeply , although his presence is everywhere - a great photo of Val@@ dez , which shows his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice &quot; hanging on the facade of the Fe@@ odo@@ ce building . two re@@ porters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez , wear t @-@ shirts , which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porters discuss their shared themes , the trauma , their night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although a Federal Prosecutor &apos;s Office was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists , it has only initiated two criminal proceedings according to the committee for the protection of journalists . &quot;
&quot; like most of the thousands of mur@@ ders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year , journalists are rarely tried by journalists . &quot;
&quot; at Ri@@ odo@@ ce they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are im@@ pregn@@ able and although the terrain is now more tre@@ ach@@ erous . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security has little use , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the reason , we mi@@ str@@ ust all . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of 15 May , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an capital . &quot;
&quot; he managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times shot on him , presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; 12th river . &quot; &quot;
the Sag@@ itt@@ arius drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a wife and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly around in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an freely .
&quot; but on Val@@ dez , there is practically nothing but silence . &quot;
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest in the last year and the delivery to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , as rival groups fight to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a one or more people are shot on the street every day or that the cemetery is full of ornam@@ ented , two @-@ storey m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug king@@ f@@ ishers , which are larger than many homes for the living . &quot;
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable har@@ bours and drug trade routes in the United States .
&quot; nevertheless and despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , was broken with guilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
&quot; at first , in February the publication of an interview with Dam@@ asc@@ ene Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival@@ ing cart@@ el frac@@ tions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons . &quot;
&quot; this release may have upset the sons , suspected gang members bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the second mistake was to not force Val@@ dez to leave the country for his own security , following the confis@@ cation of another newspaper that had published the same story . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined five colleagues for the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars .
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the drug prohibition problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; over time , the newspaper earned a reputation for the courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased . &quot;
&quot; re@@ porters loved to publish hard @-@ fitting examinations without fear of cens@@ orship , and readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories that no one else dar@@ ed to treat . &quot;
&quot; eight years after the founding of Fe@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for her reporting in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history , wherever it led . &quot;
he gave himself up voluntarily that he was afraid .
&quot; I would like to continue living , &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J . &quot;
&quot; drug trafficking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot;
&quot; you have to take over the task , which falls you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ my . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; what have you done in the face of so many dead ... why did you not say what was going on ? &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team mis@@ ses Val@@ dez , the fun bird , who was able to curse like a port worker , a friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
they trusted in his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Gu@@ ay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table . &quot;
&quot; now they ask , &quot; &quot; Was his love for the routine be his ruin ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; his death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how to do their job best , and stay alive . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their women , their children , their clean shops , their secret run@@ ways and run@@ ways to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation . &quot;
trust his own instinc@@ ts .
&quot; if it smells un@@ true , stay away from it . &quot;
&quot; the trouble is , the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell is a sense that can be fool@@ ed ... and then the thing is happening with J@@ avier . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home . &quot;
the landscape is changing constantly .
&quot; days before it became known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
&quot; outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree . &quot;
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ size Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an area .
&quot; half in the joke , some of the re@@ porters asked themselves whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who proclaimed the governor himself as not trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; it is months since the re@@ porters have gone to the mountain landscape , where drug gangs are de facto under control . &quot;
for the edition of this week Ri@@ odo@@ ce has been waiting for three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former famous bo@@ xer Juli@@ o C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
&quot; they also had an expos@@ é to the state expendi@@ tures , which concentrated on the hom@@ etown of the governor . &quot;
&quot; and there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the prosec@@ utor , conducting a kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or as it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ porter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who belonged to the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which dominated all political levels almost the whole century . &quot;
&quot; recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ cali@@ ber cases of corruption . &quot;
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous incidents in this locality , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped military attack . &quot;
only a few months before the readers of Val@@ dez had considered the best informed source about the ab@@ duction .
&quot; once we had known what happened , &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; because of his slender body stat@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication are broken with our sources . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez &apos;s office has been converted to storage space for signs and sti@@ ckers prot@@ esting against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because employees have become something they themselves never expected : activists in the name of the press . &quot;
&quot; re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez grab@@ bed a few characters , and the next morning went to a demonstration for another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor . &quot;
&quot; Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
a burnt body has been discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is its .
&quot; throughout the country , journalists have become more ph@@ one@@ tic by writing them in organized protests &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on walk@@ ways and buildings . &quot;
&quot; on that day , director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities to spy out journalists and bring them around because they have said the truth . &quot;
&quot; since then she has asked for her to be divided again by the government , because she is worried that her anger has viol@@ ated her objectiv@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime , involved government officials and an equal society . &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that re@@ porters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the command of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a ceiling with organised crime . &quot;
&quot; last year , the media guard group &quot; Arti@@ cul@@ o 19 &quot; has more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico you die , because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect . &quot;
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found along with a note that was supposed to be signed by the Z@@ et@@ as @-@ Kart@@ ell : &quot; here I am because of my reports .
a computer keyboard and ear@@ phones lay down beside their separate head .
&quot; some branches have chosen to close , like the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March . &quot;
others continue to do as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assass@@ ination of her director in 2004 .
&quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the title page with the title &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot; &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they are still watching the streets and looking for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as evi@@ dently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who stay behind and continue their work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , ad@@ mits that drug trafficking is frigh@@ tened by him . &quot;
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and so I became re@@ porter , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and drank beer when all her tel@@ eph@@ ones began bu@@ zz@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; a number of sho@@ ot@@ ings with rif@@ le ri@@ vals and security forces near Maz@@ at@@ lan , a seaside resort , had left 19 confirmed dead . &quot;
the war continued escal@@ ated as promised by a number of cart@@ el em@@ b@@ assi@@ es in the region .
from the br@@ oth@@ el edge they published the news on the website of Fe@@ odo@@ ce via mobile phone .
the title page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens how@@ l nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the police officers who kept watch to see if they were willing .
&quot; if they were afraid at all , they did not show it . &quot;
&quot; under the mighty portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for all Sin@@ alo@@ a , the employees of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his tracks . &quot;
&quot; how can you just think about it , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; when the same day J@@ avier was murdered , the intern asked me to send them to the street . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used clo@@ ak to avoid his enemies
&quot; at first sight it looks like a statue , albeit a frigh@@ tening . &quot;
&quot; now , researchers have discovered that the first findings of the incredible N@@ ash@@ ort of a Canadian min@@ er were so well received that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was so well received that she could even realize that his sc@@ aly skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said she would have had something of a &quot; &quot; troubled past &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report in the journal &quot; Current Biology &quot; referred to him as &quot; the preserved arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r , who was ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ r copies of the world . &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered species of Noah @-@ Ter@@ rier who lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous years between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; his amaz@@ ingly well @-@ preserved condition has astonished researchers , who describe it as &quot; truly remarkable . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es is the best preserved fossil in its kind . &quot;
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk when he was in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the North of Alber@@ ta , Canada on March 21 , 2011 . &quot;
&quot; he met something that seemed out of place from the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely . &quot;
the F@@ ossi@@ l discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years to uncover the wild beast within the 2,500 pound ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy earth cl@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you only blin@@ d@@ fold a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it has slept , &quot; &quot; said the chief au@@ tor Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum , where the creature is to be seen . &quot;
&quot; it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs , the Mon@@ a Lisa the din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; researchers found that these her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , although covered with arm@@ or and resembles a changing tank , probably was threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white clo@@ ak to hide from predat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as a counter @-@ protection , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this would have allowed to blend better with its surroundings and avoid its enemies , experts say , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by bigger din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million year old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier made head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now visible at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and called Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum engineer Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team who has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours with it carefully . &quot;
the amazing conservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of shed and arm@@ or over his body .
&quot; they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ ading , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , meaning that the top of the creature was darker than their under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the counter sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta far exceeds that of the today living animals . &quot;
it suggests that the din@@ osau@@ r was driven by enough pressure by eating meat @-@ eating din@@ osau@@ rs that evolution fav@@ ored the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival .
&quot; but most contemporary animals that use the counter @-@ sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or belt animals - are much smaller and vulnerable than loo@@ t , which signals that this no@@ dose @-@ din@@ osau@@ r was exposed to a real struggle for survival . &quot;
&quot; powerful predat@@ or behavior on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es must have been the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous Time , &quot; Brown said . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
&quot; scientists continue to investigate the animal in evidence of his life , including his preserved intestinal content , to find out what it has eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , fell into a river and dri@@ fted into the sea , where he sun@@ k on his back to the sea floor . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as southern fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably farther inland than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved fla@@ ky skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal , &quot; Brown said . &quot;
the result is that the animal looks almost exactly as in the early C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period .
&quot; you do not need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you only s@@ lay a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that he is asleep . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period was a time when huge ther@@ opo@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , standing on two legs , crossed the earth . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , the Tyran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , lived after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta million years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his frigh@@ tening ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters . &quot;
&quot; the scientists , whose latest findings are published in the journal Current Biology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in mud . &quot;
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk when he was in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the North of Alber@@ ta , Canada on March 21 , 2011 . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the preserved arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip . &quot;
&quot; the creatures were average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long spi@@ kes that ra@@ ved off his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es were sw@@ ung by western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea .
but the underwater cre@@ mation of the din@@ osau@@ r kept his arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the Hau@@ tre@@ ste cover still b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as rare as a win in the lot@@ tery . &quot;
&quot; the more I approach it , the more conf@@ using it becomes . &quot;
pet@@ ri@@ fied rem@@ nants of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates that carry the skull of the animal .
&quot; his right foref@@ oot lies on his side , his five fingers are sp@@ iced upwards . &quot;
I can count the scales on its sole &apos; .
thunder@@ storm : mass kar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many wounded
heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A@@ 8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
&quot; there are numerous injured , miles long sta@@ ffs - and G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; on the free@@ way Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) , about 20 people were injured at a mass kar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; after the first indications of the police were between the outlets of Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( Land@@ kreis A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm almost 30 vehicles , among them probably trucks , inter@@ connected . &quot;
&quot; at first , there was no indication of the exact number of injuries . &quot;
&quot; it was mild to moderate injury , said a police spokes@@ man . &quot;
a large number of emergency vehicles had been charged at the accident site .
the A@@ 8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich .
&quot; in the direction of travel direction Munich , a ten @-@ kilometre @-@ long back@@ stage was formed . &quot;
&quot; as an A@@ Z re@@ porter reported , it also occurred on the counter @-@ way to massive han@@ di@@ caps - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade was the hall@@ mark of the vehicle engineers who now have to calculate with sensitive pen@@ alties .
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 o &apos;clock a second accident happened at the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has already experienced : nothing is standing in the train and sleeps .
or you are immersed in his work and has just a genius thought .
and then : buff@@ ed .
comes the conductor and w@@ akes a uns@@ an@@ gled or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket inspection .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket inspection .
&quot; you simply confirm by mobile , that you take your seat and use it to vali@@ date the ticket . &quot;
&quot; currently , a test operation runs on two tracks . &quot;
&quot; if the offer comes , we extend it . &quot;
&quot; it is expected to be available at many other long distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; said a railway spokesperson . &quot;
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; calls the train card evaluation without the conductor .
&quot; in order to be able to use them , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to book an online ticket - which is already the most passengers .
&quot; it is also necessary to buy it via the app of the train , the DB Navigator , which is the most convenient way of booking a ticket . &quot;
and last but not least you need a seat reservation .
&quot; because the &quot; &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; works like this : you get into the train , calling his ticket to &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for the test customers , a button for the electronic de@@ valuation appears . &quot;
the train atten@@ d@@ ants receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y .
&quot; when the train travel companion arrives at room Y , he knows that there is a passenger with an already paid online ticket . &quot;
&quot; so you can continue to sleep , keep on working , keep silent . &quot;
&quot; check @-@ in has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn means to use the passengers . &quot;
&quot; who wants to travel relaxed without ti@@ ck@@ eting through our train service personnel , simply checked in the DB navig@@ ator itself . &quot;
&quot; this enables passengers to make their travel time in the train more personal , &quot; &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Head of Marketing of DB Fern@@ verkehr . &quot;
&quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to the individual customer needs . &quot;
&quot; those who often travel , know that in addition to delays and missed trains the ticket inspections are among the greatest off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; for many times , however , one of the travelling companions does not have all the documents required for the de@@ valuation of online tickets . &quot;
either the credit card or the identity card or otherwise a document you have to demonstrate .
&quot; the result is endless discussions between train atten@@ dant and passenger , which leads to bad mood in the compartment or large room and delays in controlling the own ticket and takes the conductor back the time to take care of other concerns . &quot;
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and also only on the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
other random numbers on the same route have not yet been released .
how an activ@@ ist came to get the answer to the question : &quot; wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was sha@@ ken up to her core .
only one day after arriving in New York City she sat in St. Louis &apos;s house on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolled by Facebook on her phone .
she stum@@ bled across a post from someone from the High School .
&quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it is still on the road , &quot; &quot; said it . &quot;
&quot; confused as nobody else posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly saved on their tim@@ eline .
&quot; the ra@@ pper in the area of St. Louis was to twe@@ ets the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . &quot;
he posted an image of Brow@@ ns lifel@@ ess body stretching out on the street and staying there for four hours .
&quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l thought . &quot;
but death was nothing new to them and their community .
she put her cell phone off to return later in the evening to twe@@ ets about people on the Can@@ field @-@ Drive .
&quot; there were photos of the police band and people that cried out , and from a man who claimed to be Brow@@ ns &apos;s father who wore a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &apos;s police just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live feed where a polic@@ eman was standing in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman took his gun and cried , &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; recalls Fer@@ rel@@ l on her statement . &quot;
this is not the kind of murder we have used to and which we can call .
at that moment I felt shi@@ vers .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after landing at 11 pm she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
&quot; what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the theme of a new documentary , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in the cinem@@ as from the 11th century . &quot;
&quot; it is a history of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance that exists from the point of view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; as Fer@@ rel@@ l with her daughter , who carried a flower dress and a suitable crown , drove to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two discussed a conversation that they had &quot; &quot; had the black experience and the black condition innum@@ erable times before this morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in ? &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot;
we now go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right .
&quot; I could not take her away , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said later . &quot;
what has happened today is a high point of what happened in the past .
it must know and see it and be educated in it .
&quot; it must be well developed not only of activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves to liber@@ ate ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I am lucky to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience a blat@@ ant racism , she is not different from the next black women &apos;s child . &quot;
I feel I would have a bad service to keep them away from it .
&quot; the first stop when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on was on the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became a camp area when the activists waited for the possible non @-@ prosecution of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
&quot; there , Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch . &quot;
they prepared bags before and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rel@@ l &apos;s shape .
&quot; my activ@@ ism totally changed after August 9 , &quot; she said and noted that she as a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis was President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black commun@@ es . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
everything has come . &quot;
&quot; weeks later Fer@@ rel@@ l met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an during an evening demonstration , one of the film &apos;s co @-@ directors . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman , Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r , wanted to &quot; document &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; one question came from Fer@@ rel@@ l : &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story that you can take advantage of ? &quot;
&quot; this scep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by innum@@ erable cases of people , often from wh@@ ites - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resili@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; &quot; we heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have not centered their voices , and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt . &quot;
&quot; his commitment brought Fer@@ rel@@ l closer to the project , along with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns &apos;s shooting . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone talking to us or talking to us . we talk , &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me , as these people are represented , because so I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ el &apos;s experience - to show that it is not a Messiah @-@ leader but a community that comes together , &quot; &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it turned out to be the most obvious participant in the film . &quot;
&quot; as a result , documents from &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; show surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ ell &apos;s life as she falls in love with her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and the de@@ human@@ ization of black people .
&quot; in addition , Ferr@@ is &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , who have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ live Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media after killing the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 , identify themselves as gay . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; &quot; and so we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women must carry the main burden of all . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice that &quot; &quot; the movement really is held up by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she insi@@ sts , however , that &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; at which Fer@@ rel@@ l was chosen as the heart of the film due to her identity . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is not a coincidence , although it was at the forefront because in a life on these cross@@ ings as a black gay woman there is so much on the game . &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long since disappeared , but the racial links between the municipality and the police continue to exist . &quot;
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years because of the blocking of a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; chaos . &quot;
&quot; she still cl@@ ings to a song , and she feels bound to this memory since she walked into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago . &quot;
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV readers discuss about bit gallery
&quot; the Bit Gallery moves people , although they are not built for a long time . &quot;
but the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone spl@@ its people into pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
the issue is hardly cold .
&quot; on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg , &quot; the topic is discussed . &quot;
&quot; while some say to the bit gallery : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That &apos;s really great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; don &apos;t need a person &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot;
&quot; while the pro@@ pon@@ ents build that a gallery attracts more customers , the other shops also benefit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian area is bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the gallery is planned precisely on the property on which the farmer &apos;s market hall stands , in which 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products . &quot;
&quot; with the beginning of the construction works , the end will be finished . &quot;
&quot; the gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building , namely to the Bed@@ a Square with the opportunity to sit outside . &quot;
&quot; Sim@@ one Zimmer : &quot; &quot; we &apos;ve been buying almost every week in the farmer &apos;s market for many years . &quot;
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the farm women are always very happy . &quot;
we also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us .
&quot; we would like to wish that , even during and , especially after the construction of the gallery , there is a chance to maintain this offer . &quot;
in other cities there is that too .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct market@@ ers live in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of rent .
&quot; however , this should not be low in the new project . &quot;
&quot; Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; &quot; what &apos;s the most important shopping list in Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
&quot; whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I find that unnecessary . &quot;
there are already enough of this in our city .
you can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .
&quot; but since there is not even a regular weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains . &quot;
&quot; after all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly offered directly from the producer and is inexpensive . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , shops in a shopping mall are only rented by larger companies , as the renting shops are often not portable for a retailer . &quot;
&quot; what a pity , specialty shops are almost no longer available and what is left of them will probably disappear . &quot;
wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall doesn &apos;t fit together for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the farmer &apos;s market hall be ?
&quot; the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution , even if the bit gallery actually comes . &quot;
or does the ghost@@ ly bit gallery already manage to sell all shops from Bit@@ burg ?
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that will just not work .
&quot; and a shopping center that is empty , nobody needs . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market instead of this gallery . &quot;
&quot; but for a farmer &apos;s market hall , thanks to the ins@@ ane many - as I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg no longer place . &quot;
&quot; when the farmers market hall is destroyed , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
&quot; in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , there are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which almost identi@@ cally resem@@ ble the cables hanging from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ pers and hair@@ cuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
&quot; Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former secret service analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year custo@@ dial sentence after publicly classified diplomatic reports on Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website . &quot;
&quot; the new exhibition , opened on August 2nd , is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( a fitting simil@@ arity ) . &quot;
&quot; she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline reconc@@ iled her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans @-@ woman and ground@@ breaking dis@@ sident , whose conviction was changed by Barack Obama , when he only had three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; through algorith@@ mic analysis of the DNA , which was extracted by man and created from the 30 portraits , how someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data could look a sharp , albeit somewhat intellectual commentary not only to the form@@ ability of DNA data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also for identity . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but had already spoken openly about identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013 , including six violations of the es@@ pi@@ onage law , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; her image was supp@@ ressed by the prison , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing obviously sits on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wig - with which she was associated . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the huge success of its 2012 project &quot; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons . &quot; &quot;
the artist produced portraits of for@@ en@@ sic art@@ ef@@ acts like cigarette but@@ to@@ cks and ch@@ ewing gum by extrac@@ ting the DNA from the waste to make a picture of how these people could look .
this was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in jail and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg during a press preview of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; she couldn &apos;t visit her at that time and she could not be photographed , so they contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
&quot; the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated mice became an un@@ equal spectacle , which in the course of two years exchanged several letters . &quot;
&quot; they even created a Com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o , who fores@@ aw a future in which the president would transform his judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; that Obama was indeed just a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as was a welcome kind of happy meeting . &quot;
&quot; there is also at the opening of the exhibition something deep and strong , since Donald Tru@@ mp leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new twe@@ et@@ able ways to fix the rigid divisions that he should actually fix . &quot;
&quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked for the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
&quot; in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing asked with her over@@ sized signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name is equipped with a heart ) an end to &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , based on gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall is its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - an exchange of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des after the highly developed scientific glos@@ s@@ ary of the artist ) , as surprisingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all . &quot;
&quot; what people will hopefully take with it is that our gen@@ ome does not care who we are and how open genetic data for interpretation and how subj@@ ectively they are , &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also to be seen . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is a page from the above @-@ mentioned comic @-@ novel . &quot;
&quot; she shows Mann@@ ing , how she emerges with a hands @-@ free phone in hand from the United States disciplinary batt@@ les@@ hips like King Kong . &quot;
&quot; when they make your speech cold , then they won , &quot; &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; so , never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; said the artist who greetings from Philadelphia . &quot;
I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I talk about it .
&quot; Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but when she was supposed to do it , she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks from her own gen@@ om@@ ic simulations , which gather like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this was also aimed at how everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , where their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past , I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg of the portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was also hiding behind its liberation . &quot;
Professor of the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of Oxford University for killing
&quot; a nation @-@ wide ch@@ ase is going on for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee of Oxford University who were looking for susp@@ ects , after a man was stab@@ bed in a luxurious Chicago apartment with deadly injuries . &quot;
on Monday for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them@@ en ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts were issued for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au .
&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches . &quot;
a communal warning system published by the Chicago police authority states that the dead body was discovered on 27 July .
&quot; officials received a call , arrived at Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead at the site of the event , and det@@ ectiv@@ es investigate the stit@@ ches as murder while the police actively seek the two susp@@ ects , said civil servants . &quot;
La@@ them has been an associate professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University since 2007 .
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ ensis , vice @-@ president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail explaining that La@@ them had now been in a rating and excluded from entering the campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal case investigated by the competent authorities , and Nor@@ th@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; said Cub@@ ensis . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; a speaker at the University and the Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an email statement that &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and ready to help US investig@@ ators in every way possible . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to stand up .
&quot; chief Communications Officer of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he ur@@ ges the susp@@ ects to submit to the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them strengthen , &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received an en@@ ig@@ matic tip that said something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 . &quot;
the police described the scene very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July .
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ them@@ es and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the Grand Plaza &apos;s management team published an explanation to the residents : &quot; &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and explores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; we will complete the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; - the Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mut@@ ko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t take a long time until the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ) . &quot;
&quot; the WA@@ DA road@@ map has been updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; explained Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the PM commented on the second part of WA@@ DA &apos;s schedule to comply with the code , which describes the criteria for the re @-@ implementation of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and was recently published on the organization &apos;s website . &quot;
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he doesn &apos;t have anything to give concern to Russia . &quot;
&quot; everything was announced , everything is being implemented . &quot;
&quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; one of the criteria mentioned in the list , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities have to publicly accept the reported results of the study approved by the WA@@ DA by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren for alleged state @-@ supported dop@@ ing in Russian sport . &quot;
&quot; in relation to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has caused an error . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there were no governmental programs , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ kos &apos;s words were consistent with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with the Russian sales office at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov announced problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but then added : &quot; &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; Sm@@ ir@@ nov added . &quot;
&quot; in November 2015 , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from the use of dop@@ ing control in Russia in the course of dop@@ ing sc@@ and@@ als by the WA@@ DA . &quot;
&quot; however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ( U@@ K@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; after a visit to the main quarter of the organization in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA General Director Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli said that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moves &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again . &quot;

start @-@ ups that will help your company not to become the next U@@ ber
&quot; A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure luck with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys did not work . &quot;
&quot; answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the trial . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and objectiv@@ ity , &quot; &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce hair care company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot;
she sum@@ mon@@ ed people from outside for help .
a new breed of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is at wa@@ xing to help companies find out how their employees feel .
&quot; by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee &apos;s commitment , it enables companies to offer surveys , speci@@ alize groups and demographic groups , employees anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow to b@@ ypass the C @-@ Suite managers and turn directly to the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; you now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking your health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement . &quot;
Er@@ ret@@ t said they had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t won .
&quot; in addition to the Sn@@ ap p@@ olls and p@@ olls of certain teams , it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low supply results so that you can re@@ boot , why . &quot;
&quot; companies are coming to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber , who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former colleague has published a blog post that describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment where those who have spoken are punished . &quot;
&quot; for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t , this desire is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity . &quot;
&quot; global governance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion by 2020 , according to the new Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments website . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , the company helps prevent bad behavior and recognize , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the U@@ ber case in Mis@@ kol@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ ver@@ cent has almost 600 clients including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
&quot; as G@@ lin@@ t , Con@@ ver@@ cent enables companies to send tailor @-@ made &quot; &quot; pulse &quot; &quot; surveys , collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas . &quot;
it also provides an anonymous SMS Hot@@ line with which employees can report bad behavior .
&quot; and if the main business guide is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board . &quot;
&quot; the public opinion has seized the regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; if a company is found that treats its staff badly or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee turnover and col@@ la@@ ges , said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , has used Con@@ ver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters . &quot;
&quot; earlier , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email for the corporate headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often a in@@ timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ Y@@ S General Co@@ uns@@ el who said there was no good opportunity to follow the complaints of employees . &quot;
&quot; now , as the company utili@@ zes Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that were previously hidden by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair tra@@ ine@@ es@@ - can be identified and addressed faster . &quot;
&quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience with employment , &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who leads the risk management group of Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; companies began to seriously consider Eth@@ ics , Val@@ ues and Emplo@@ ye@@ es Engagement in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed due to ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said . &quot;
&quot; but it took until the &quot; social media came to their right , &quot; that businesses realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot;
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service and charge the companies with recurring fees for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the consent of venture capital investors who have supported both start @-@ ups .
&quot; Con@@ ver@@ cent received $ 10 million in financing in February from firms such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , with which total capital was raised to $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; gl@@ it@@ tering insured $ 10 million in November of B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners , and brought his entire funding to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; these investments are hardly surprising , given the inter@@ connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
&quot; there is a growing complex of research , which shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before . &quot;
&quot; in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only used . &quot;
employees want the feeling that you will be accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company that is worth their voices , and that the work you do is worthwhile , then they feel more committed to making this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t are used . &quot;
investors reach returns when their portfolio companies are well running . companies are running well when employees are committed and committed .
&quot; when the third party analytics tools promise to increase engagement and use of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support . &quot;
the data about employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture are important .
but the data are useless if the managers of a company do not take action .
&quot; in fact , when a company asks employees for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and when the changes do not come fast enough , or not at all , this can breed dis@@ appointments and motiv@@ ate employees . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management firm Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have reli@@ ed too much on collecting data . &quot;
&quot; for if you do not follow employees , ask , &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot;
do you worry about it ?
&quot; and if you don &apos;t care , why should I ? &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now performs monthly sta@@ ff@@ ing surveys , has been able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t , says Er@@ ret@@ t . &quot;
&quot; and after gathering feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organize multiple teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems . &quot;
&quot; in Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company always gets new insights into the employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this leads to better engagement of workers in a sector that is known for high turnover . &quot;
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , you will lose business . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the fry
it &apos;s about 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA football players talk on one side of the new practice areas of the team on campus .
some have moved out their tri@@ cot parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team these idle minutes are a lunch break .
players who are enrolled in the Summer Cour@@ ses will return to their audi@@ ts after the three hour exercise before they return to the Wasser@@ man Football Center the next morning at 6 : 30 p.m .
&quot; this is a real treadmill for the guys the next three days , &quot; said Bru@@ in @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before the Monday became a Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of the players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three training sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 7 : 15 o &apos;clock in order to meet the fully packed schedule of the players . &quot;
&quot; the compromise between the two days is more than a day , at which the Bru@@ ges postpon@@ ed the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as conducted six playing times in West@@ wood practical exercises . &quot;
they are supposed to do 18 exercises over the course of August . 20 before the beginning of the formal game preparations for their pr@@ elu@@ de to Texas A &amp; M in September .
&quot; Mor@@ a said he supports the change in rules of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players . &quot;
&quot; we put this enormous strain on them three or four days , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they simply pushed it through , they pl@@ under@@ ing , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think , as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it &apos;s really great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practices once the camp is finished , which in view of the clear lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class that has already cleared a protective enclosure behind a door@@ post , will not be an easy task . &quot;
&quot; Bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people will rent a room there and then set up there to record an exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you have the video tape of one exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal . &quot;
&quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking place 8 . &quot;
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t worry too much about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts checks in the fight against fake news
&quot; Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false noti@@ fications to third parties and show their results in the original article , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of its efforts to combat so @-@ called F@@ ake News . &quot;
the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to identify possible false noti@@ fications and to send them to fac@@ tual inspec@@ tors who may display results of the fact check out of the original article .
&quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they also influenced the US presidential elections 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters being flooded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan to quickly eliminate h@@ ass@@ le posting such as the elections there in September . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Facebook said in a separate declaration in German that a test of new facts will be started in the United States , France , the Netherlands and Germany . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the knowledge that stories of fac@@ tual exam@@ in@@ ers are challenged by third parties , people want more context in order to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Product Manager for Facebook messages in a blog . &quot;
she added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the &quot; related article &quot; and works on other changes to its news feed to reduce false news .
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
&quot; in his recent past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ s and 1980 @-@ s . &quot;
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his comfortable seat in the admir@@ ation River Valley in K@@ ent and now has become an inspiration for a graphical novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I think it &apos;s so nice to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; he says bol@@ dly . &quot;
what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England stretches the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac steering ie@@ wicz , British May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Is@@ abel Gre@@ enberg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rho@@ des , based on an archive : he wrote &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpected emotional . &quot;
&quot; I only responded to the thumb print on the page of a letter , written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is his thumb print !
&quot; and letters always smell of smoke , for at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he were himself . &quot;
&quot; Ah , I love archives ! &quot;
&quot; for someone who is sm@@ itten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome greeting &quot; &quot; ) it seems all too beautiful to be true . &quot;
&quot; Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ena pots on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he wander@@ ed through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle , and spoke with landscape chi@@ ckens , gar@@ den@@ ers , and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he drank &quot; Whis@@ key &quot; and started to write . &quot;
&quot; the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , as the National Trust only received full access in 2006 when the last heir , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died . &quot;
&quot; when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees began to take care of the archive that he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which ari@@ sto@@ cr@@ ats said , &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Emp@@ ires , cards that represent what possessed : &quot; you could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to have fought the two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let &apos;s all go his way ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immer@@ se yourself in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , who follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of an uph@@ eav@@ al that occurred in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ gh@@ tly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , says Rho@@ des . &quot;
the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought it was a good start .
perhaps the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot;
&quot; other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ ter , which the family Dar@@ rel@@ l hid for seven years during the English Reformation . &quot;
&quot; or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; , portra@@ yed in the 18th century smu@@ gg@@ ler Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l , who produced his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery made only years later when his coff@@ in was dug ) . &quot;
&quot; the Dar@@ r@@ als are Rho@@ des &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; the gentlemen seemed to be quite a cro@@ ok , always making money and spending money for things they could not afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l @-@ men solved their debt crises , mar@@ rying wealthy old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to adverti@@ se creation . &quot;
&quot; after the end of his work in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique writing experiences &quot;
&quot; he has taken a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ män@@ mä@@ ki , the territory of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed from nature . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like &quot; &quot; Ah , now I have to deal with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign started : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle veiled in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
&quot; with the closure of the 30@@ 1 year old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Honnef started its campaign for the introduction of a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau of Thursday ) on Friday . &quot;
&quot; until Thursday , mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team headed by Nelson Ar@@ tz want to keep the logo and the slogan secret . &quot;
at the end of August there will be a festival on Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th Island as the highlight of the campaign .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; or ? &quot; &quot; the makers of the action have been asking for the posters at the &quot; &quot; Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer Chapel &quot; &quot; since yesterday . &quot;
&quot; we do not really think this ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; they write on their website un@@ folded yesterday . &quot;
but we use this measure to gain your attention .
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; in essence , we are convinced that we as a bad partner are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
&quot; the action is more than &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it &apos;s called on . &quot;
&quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all @-@ inclusive promise , one that gives the city an unmistak@@ able unique selling proposition . &quot;
&quot; finally , they stand in competition with other commun@@ es . &quot;
the city of Bad Honnef can cost a medium five @-@ digit amount with its new umbrella brand and campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
&quot; every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advises against reti@@ rements and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps . &quot;
so also this week .
at first sight a normal process .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish forces one year after the attempted coup attempt .
&quot; the meeting was no longer held in the headquarters of the General Staff , as before , but in the office of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; under the chair@@ manship of the Heads of State , the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Ministers of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs also took part in the discussions . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the civilians in the Y@@ AS were in the over@@ population . &quot;
the government dra@@ gs the re@@ ins in the military .
&quot; the Chief of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , the forces of air and the nav@@ y were dismissed . &quot;
&quot; since the failed coup , head of head Erdo@@ gan has fired 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als . &quot;
&quot; more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of the exile @-@ pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erdo@@ gan as the wire drawing of the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; against 4@@ 86 people , who should have participated directly in the coup attempt , is being negotiated in Ankara since this week . &quot;
&quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had designated the attempted coup as a &quot; &quot; gift of God &quot; , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to completely clean the armed forces . &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really have the army under control ?
&quot; at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ ease in the Military Head@@ quarters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the general staff , there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ fests itself in the lifting of the head@@ sc@@ arf ban on soldiers , wrote the paper . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the large @-@ scale coach in the army and the security forces continues . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of July , Erdo@@ gan had another 7@@ 3@@ 95 State officials fired by decree , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers . &quot;
it seemed as if Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were formerly considered the masters of the country .
&quot; three times , they listened to their role as guar@@ dians of the secular state . &quot;
&quot; after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan was pushing back the power of the military step by step , not least by calling on the reform requirements of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say that Erdo@@ gan is pushing ahead with an Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; a particularly un@@ named officer who sought asylum after the attempted put@@ sch of fear of persecution abroad , the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and sal@@ aries &quot; in a few years . &quot;
&quot; if this is true , such development could not allow Nato to be cold . &quot;
&quot; anyway , in the Alliance after the pur@@ ges there is doubt about the willingness of the Turkish Army . &quot;
&quot; the leadership structures and operational skills are &quot; weakened , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
&quot; there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tru@@ mp , cited by the media . &quot;
&quot; it envis@@ ages lowering the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules for obtaining visa for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family @-@ oriented vis@@ as . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the draft law shall be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pa@@ yers and will do so by changing the way the US will change the way citizens from other countries will be issued Green Cards . &quot;
the law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; said Tru@@ mp , quoted by the American media . &quot;
Ministry wants to renov@@ ate route for race @-@ platform shuttle
&quot; again and again over the past few months , the future of the race platform has been cont@@ ested - now it is going to be quite fast . &quot;
&quot; before the end of the year , the geo@@ des route , on which the tourist train runs , is to be built . &quot;
&quot; in order to secure the future of the race @-@ platform @-@ sh@@ utt@@ les in the long term , construction work will start on the track in this year according to the Ministry of Transport . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to continue ordering and renov@@ ating the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country comm@@ its itself to this important connection particularly for tourism , &quot; explained Secretary of State Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot;
the cost of maintenance of the track was about 2.5 million euros .
&quot; from this sum , the country exceeds 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , on which the shuttle will be ordered also in the future from the country , will be finally agreed , S@@ üh@@ l declared . &quot;
the ministry and the South Thurin@@ gia railway as operators are already in agreement with the technical details .
&quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company is closed for a period of eleven years .
&quot; as a result , the race @-@ stei@@ g Shuttle should be ordered regular on December 2017 . &quot;
the shuttle bus is an especially popular railway link between Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g railway stations .
&quot; in the past few months , the course of a pilot plant has been tested to determine whether the route is used by sufficient number of people in order to order them regularly in the future . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the track is strongly b@@ ump@@ y in parts . &quot;
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry
&quot; just as you thought it can &apos;t become even more crazy in 2017 , a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots arrives . &quot;
&quot; yes , in fact . &quot;
sex robots are currently a big thing .
&quot; recently , Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( Foundation for Respon@@ sible Rob@@ otik ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years . &quot;
&quot; according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Professor of Robot@@ ics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we have to start taking their Ascension seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye colour of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail . &quot;
&quot; people make fun of them , but companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more often , &quot; &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey on the release of his new report . &quot;
modern sex mannequins have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can &quot; &quot; adjust &quot; &quot; his robot accordingly and select everything from the eye colour of the robot through the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or colour of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; but it becomes even more disturbing , as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would make a step@@ ford wife look progressive . &quot;
modern sex mannequins have evolved into robots with a silicone skin .
&quot; the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot allows for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ xy gold sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed personalities like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which con@@ veys the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild Wend@@ y &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; enth@@ uses the website of True Compan@@ ion . &quot;
&quot; so she likes what you like , and she likes not what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
in the course of the day she also has her m@@ oods - quite like real people !
&quot; she can be tired , be fixed on conversation , or she can be &quot; in mood &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive feminine features , the all@@ u@@ sions to rape , when one goes a step towards Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means here : reluct@@ ant ) Far@@ rah , distur@@ b most . &quot;
&quot; on his website true Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men . &quot;
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men not have Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ xy ? &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex toy . &quot;
&quot; their formation and increasing refin@@ ement point to something darker and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition . &quot;
&quot; most men will of course not hold any sex robots , and while the FR@@ R notices their increasing popularity , they still remain on the ver@@ ge of consumer culture . &quot;
but what se@@ eps out of the fr@@ inge can be very instruc@@ tive in relation to the spirit of time in which we live .
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission .
&quot; there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots are emerging in a time where women &apos;s rights are threatened worldwide , in which there is a president in the White House who has shown that women have been sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; the most terrible aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The report of the maid &apos; ) are not the graphic images , the ent@@ win@@ ed body and the st@@ och@@ rome eyes , but how real@@ istically this vision works . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap . &quot;
the goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical resem@@ b@@ lance to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( albeit with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human@@ ely that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; but , when it comes to their &quot; person@@ ages , &quot; the robots do not represent real women . &quot;
they cannot separate or simply go away from their companion .
&quot; they have no mediation or background story , nothing that indicates independence or anything that might distur@@ b the fantasy of total submission . &quot;
&quot; in other words , they are pleasing slaves . &quot;
or to express it in the Spe@@ ech of 2017 : maid
Tru@@ mp@@ s great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney an ep@@ it@@ ome of common sense of man
&quot; it has become a Bin@@ sen@@ ess of the Tru@@ mp era that the political divisions , which have pol@@ arized the US voters , have split families in small @-@ format . &quot;
&quot; around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving , there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of Tru@@ mp &apos;s sel@@ ections . &quot;
we are all supposed to let our filter bubbles burst .
&quot; less noted is the power of Tru@@ mp@@ s , to bring families together . &quot;
&quot; I mention this because my cous@@ in , a lef@@ tist poet , who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York . &quot;
it reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
&quot; with Tru@@ mp in the White House everyone who knows it , including the republi@@ can relationship with which she had fought for decades because of politics suddenly and quite strange on the same page . &quot;
&quot; this is certainly a good thing about the dining table , but it is important to me that this also ent@@ ails substantial risks . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tru@@ mp , but the issuing effect of his pres@@ idency has the power to push us all to the right . &quot;
&quot; when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and Tru@@ mp , we refer to the vag@@ ue possibility that his k@@ itt@@ ens will no longer be rep@@ ul@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; however , there is an even more frigh@@ tening long @-@ term scenario in which Tru@@ mp Republi@@ can of the Right wing norm@@ alizes &quot; &quot; which suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison with its standards . &quot;
&quot; today , I find myself inf@@ ested by an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s original version of the mad@@ man - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked like ) - both in comparison to Tru@@ mp in fact seem to be a very mild crime . &quot;
&quot; when Tru@@ mp goes , the next candidate of the Republi@@ can only needs to be mentally healthy in order to qualify as an im@@ meas@@ urable improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my cous@@ in was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ ous@@ el of the New York park department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need any caffeine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are grow@@ ling and the animals twist themselves to look full of fear of their own shoulders - extremely dark and the clim@@ ati@@ zing music con@@ veys this in a curious way . &quot;
&quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of tall buildings are old , the sky@@ lines are too familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not live up to the dream . &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not completely over the day when I found that Swiss Cot@@ tage is not a Swiss Cot@@ tage - the Them@@ e Pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage is not - but a big roundabout in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; however , the Central Park Kar@@ us@@ el is still an odd magical experience since two two @-@ year @-@ old , an 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women can go on it in the 40@@ s and all have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could have assessed the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but luckily no one asked for it . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter . &quot;
&quot; this not only results in a slow@@ down of what should be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ ologi@@ zing , while I was tired of my experience to extend my credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us transferred to hospital with chest pain
&quot; for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit . &quot;
&quot; last year , due to the treatment of cuts on his wrist , he was hospit@@ alized , according to the prison authorities , according to a case in his cell . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us was convic@@ ted of murder following an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors against a first total slaughter .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning hours of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day 2013 by firing it several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a .
&quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girlfriend for a ni@@ gh@@ tly intru@@ der , who hid in the cabin . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six @-@ year sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us Appe@@ al , of which they say it is too len@@ i@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; the National Prosecutor said that she would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the objection could be heard this year . &quot;
&quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us runs the risk of increasing his sentence to 15 years , when the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful . &quot;
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
when Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg
&quot; as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four@@ ths of F@@ ats and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were released into the holidays and in the secondary schools . &quot;
&quot; three of the discharge students will go to secondary school , four at the secondary school . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday evening , the school manager An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen . &quot;
&quot; the 29 students of the four classes , headed by Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der , chose a young Adler who grew up in the poultry farm , but then released into freedom . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , the che@@ ek presented a musical with the title &quot; Der Adler in the hen &apos;s farm . &quot; &quot;
&quot; farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and let it bro@@ o@@ fold from his chi@@ ckens . &quot;
&quot; instead of a chicken nest , a small eagle came out . &quot;
&quot; but the hope of making a chicken out of it sm@@ ashed , the eagle spread out its wings on a high mountain . &quot;
&quot; after that , the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance . &quot;
&quot; the h@@ ens danced with the young go@@ ck@@ les , the cylinders bore to the bet . &quot;
&quot; the Eagle stands for integration , said the school director An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte . &quot;
&quot; the young is different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belong to it . &quot;
but he will never be like a chicken .
his determination is to be free .
she wished each district chan@@ ger that he felt accepted in his new school .
&quot; thanks to the colleagues , the former school manager Michael Müller , who always jumps into teaching positions , and the parents &apos; representatives . &quot;
&quot; the ch@@ ick @-@ up time is over , declared class teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher . &quot;
&quot; after two years of teaching , she was very reluct@@ ant to teach her students because it was a really great time . &quot;
&quot; finally , she was able to rely on the four @-@ leg@@ ged parents . &quot;
&quot; at the end , all students could hear a song of summer time and holiday time . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , great joy broke out among the children . &quot;
eight primary schools are already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
&quot; two Bulg@@ arians were detained for illegal camps in Greece , divided the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , cited by television . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of August 1 , a group of illegal people was arrested by the police in Si@@ th@@ onia , including the two Bulg@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , they were released while an investigation is underway . &quot;
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were released later .
&quot; the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened the control of the free camp and put on anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose , substantial fin@@ es . &quot;
checks are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court can impose a fine fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what people need to know about now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
must diesel @-@ drivers participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
&quot; at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars . &quot;
they are intended to improve the emissions of vehicles of the emission classes Euro 5 and some Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or bad are exemp@@ t from it .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin from ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments :
is the new promotion mandatory ?
no . the software updates negotiated are voluntary .
&quot; the obligatory updates are valid only for the vehicles that have Schumann software , &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
their retro@@ fitting has ordered the power@@ train Federal Office ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
&quot; the manufacturers have announced spe@@ edy implementation within the next few months , but not yet called a precise date . &quot;
Daimler told us to write to each affected person .
&quot; if an inspection is due anyway , it will be done within its framework . &quot;
how long will the change@@ over be drawn in total ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
the link@@ age depends on the manufacturer &apos;s commitment as well as from political pressure .
&quot; because we have seen , the autom@@ akers are not acting on the subject of the environment so far . &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming can be to get an appointment .
&quot; what do drivers do that do not drive cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ? &quot;
the ACE advises to wait .
&quot; probably foreign manufacturers would follow , so S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
is there a massive decline in the price of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE fears that .
but in the regions where driving forbidden is threatening .
&quot; in rural areas , there is so far no loss of value for older diesel . &quot;
the ACE advises to wait with a sale .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first prize @-@ giving ceremony under President Tru@@ mp promises to become political .
one of the pri@@ z@@ ew@@ inners does not want to come - out of protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to receive one of the cov@@ eted awards from the renowned Kennedy Center .
&quot; this year also singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ographer Carmen de Lav@@ al@@ lade ( 86 ) and TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) are among the hon@@ ors . &quot;
the awards will be presented at the beginning of December .
&quot; traditionally , US President Donald Tru@@ mp will receive a reception and join the award with his wife Mel@@ ania . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the lau@@ re@@ ate Le@@ ar announced with progressive TV series announced that they had to take part in the gala . &quot;
&quot; the New York Times said : &quot; &quot; this pres@@ idency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even depri@@ ving them of the means - and that bur@@ sts me . &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an emphasized that she will use Tru@@ mp to clarify their views .
&quot; the Kennedy Center , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital . &quot;
&quot; the former lau@@ re@@ ates include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing . &quot;
we make the city liv@@ able
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ lach city forem@@ an , goes into retirement next year . &quot;
&quot; the place is already written - however , suitable applicants are rare . &quot;
&quot; for 31 years , W@@ acker has been a city engineer . &quot;
and the work is still a lot of fun for him as he talks in the press conference .
&quot; he reports of varied , but also demanding tasks that await his successor . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , it is wonderful that no application has yet fulfilled the requirements profile . &quot;
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible date .
&quot; in this way , considering the regular periods of notice , there will still be enough time for a revision . &quot;
&quot; since Has@@ lach acts as a sub @-@ contractor for the administration community , the applicant has to provide appropriate conclusions . &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city alive .
&quot; if they were unable to fill them out , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; but clos@@ eness to the town is important to the city and to it itself , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working atmosphere and good atmosphere between the authorities and citizens . &quot;
&quot; in more than 30 years in ministry , some important projects have accumulated to look back on the W@@ acker with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; &quot; he is sure about the building department and his staff . &quot;
&quot; but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen parking lot have been initiated . &quot;
&quot; the bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium renovation is still a topic . &quot;
&quot; the latter alone will book with some 1.5 million euros , &quot; if we do it right , &quot; W@@ acker appreci@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
&quot; in terms of design , there is a lot of room for a city building master . &quot;
Has@@ lach &apos;s own farm and gar@@ dener can react very flexibly to many .
&quot; you can move a lot , &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; as the Old Town as an ensemble is listed as a listed monument , it is important to &quot; have an eye on what fits in , &quot; when new buildings are approved , the reti@@ ring Stadt@@ bau@@ meister stresses . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has a high responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is builder , &quot; in the end everything runs over my table . &quot;
&quot; with care and coordination , he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been working for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; also that his successor is long , W@@ acker wants : &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay in place . &quot;
&quot; continuity is not only important for a good working climate , but also for the further design of the city . &quot;
those who want to be buried in Roland W@@ acker should have a completed degree as a diploma in the town of Has@@ lach as a diploma engineer or a bach@@ elor &apos;s degree in architecture and have a good knowledge of the fields of construction and construction planning .
&quot; the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt under@@ goes construction and civil engineering , construction instruction planning , under@@ mining , administration of urban property , urban facilities with building yard and municipal gardening as well as underground building rights authority , including monument protection . &quot;
whe@@ eled bike on lines : south track closed
&quot; according to the police , the previously unknown perpetr@@ ators had thrown the blue bike on the lines of the rail track in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) . &quot;
these were damaged so strongly that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male perpetr@@ ators and have been looking for them since the night hours .
&quot; near the crime scene , a ros@@ y sco@@ oter and a bike rider had been observed by witnesses . &quot;
&quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ bu@@ b region , &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch to the AP@@ A . &quot;
the perpetr@@ ators would have brought themselves into great danger and je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed the train traffic .
&quot; in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the equipment , as well as the delay @-@ ride and the costs for rail freight traffic , the railway customers could also pay attention to the perpetr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; all in all , it was a &quot; &quot; substantial &quot; &quot; sum , the speaker said . &quot;
&quot; the damage was rec@@ tified on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the south track could be carried out without hind@@ ran@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; almost ten people had dropped out on Friday morning , two of which were watching long @-@ distance traffic . &quot;
&quot; freight trains did not fall off , but they had delay . &quot;
&quot; according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man , Christoph Pos@@ ch had to exchange about 200 metres of overhead lines . &quot;
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help relieve IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease ) &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
&quot; but a new study says exactly the opposite : a diet rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
&quot; the incur@@ able state , which affects approximately 1.3 million and 300@@ ,000 in the United States , causes stomach cr@@ amps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recurring or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme fatigue . &quot;
&quot; during the suffer@@ ers usually get to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms , researchers found out at the University of Washington that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells in the gut pat@@ rol to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in the food do not penetrate the body . &quot;
&quot; cells that are capable of trig@@ gering inflammation , are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue . &quot;
&quot; if the balance is too far towards inflammation , it can result in inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
experiments have found that a kind of tolerance promotes immune cells in mice that carry a specific bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to replace the appearance of the cells .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; &quot; we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet tolerant of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han , more toler@@ able , less inflammatory bow@@ el mi@@ lie@@ us , if the same system works in humans as well . &quot;
&quot; post @-@ doctoral researcher Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan examined a kind of immune cell promoting tolerance when it found that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , but which had not been separated . &quot;
&quot; they suspected that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bial mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; the intest@@ ines of the mice were DNA sequ@@ enced and six bacterial species were found , which were present in mice with the immune cells , but without them missing in the mice . &quot;
&quot; mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they lack@@ ed an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells . &quot;
&quot; to understand how bacteria spread to the immune system , the researchers let L. reu@@ ter@@ i grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on im@@ mature immune cells isolated from the mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed into the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
&quot; when the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism , known as i@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid . &quot;
&quot; if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot;
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan stated that people have the same tolerant cells as mice and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i protect in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
&quot; it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as with mice , but defects in genes in relationship to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
she said : &quot; the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflamm@@ ations on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine .
potential high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values can potentially lead to an extension of this population in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
&quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million pound Sig@@ nature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid starts on Tuesday and impressed in the role of the holder as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched at will . &quot;
&quot; M@@ atic had , however , been excluded from the pre @-@ prepar@@ atory Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes what M@@ our@@ in@@ ho claimed he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , genius in the way he thinks - he thinks soccer , &quot; &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
we will help him to be ready sooner than later .
&quot; alongside M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started in the Avi@@ va Stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho formed his start @-@ XI for the start of the season . &quot;
&quot; this week the Independent revealed that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho had three more new obligations , but he insi@@ sted that the club had already made a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfil three of its four primary commitments . &quot;
&quot; three out of four , I thank the association , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have taken great effort . &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner into the sky .
&quot; the pilots flew off Seattle in the US state of Washington , but the drawing started in Marqu@@ ette in US state Mich@@ igan and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which is several thousand kilometers . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on radar screens the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing has used this kind of advertisement earlier .
&quot; thus , the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky . &quot;
&quot; new draft for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem &quot;
&quot; as the wind is turning : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still SPD leader , S &amp; D prime ministers were always looking for Berlin with a certain concern . &quot;
&quot; only no bon@@ fires from the party centre , but no head@@ wind from the Con@@ federation - was the most important wish of the elec@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally . &quot;
&quot; since then , the members of the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus watch the events in the SPD @-@ governed provincial capitals . &quot;
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in the approach with head@@ winds .
there were lows .
and one after the other .
&quot; according to the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against coalition government and the Gre@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; this shows once again : red @-@ green can simply not rule reliably , &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; s &amp; D Euro MPs backed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l , the SPD ) into a severe crisis . &quot;
&quot; five months before the election , his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ voice majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
&quot; the Green Federal Executive Officer , Michael Kell@@ ner , has called on the back@@ sliding Lower Saxony Green Euro MP El@@ ke T@@ ests to return her mandate . &quot;
the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the voters .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests must immediately give back her mandate , &quot; &quot; said the Federal President and Elec@@ toral Manager of the Gre@@ ens to the German editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; this must not be true at all , &quot; an SPD elec@@ tor si@@ ghs , when on Friday morning the new job message reached the party centre . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , is there for the CD@@ U without its own government majority after the green de@@ pu@@ ties of El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests . &quot;
it is the temporary high point of a whole series of big and small crises in SPD state associations .
and no one knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ er began with the un@@ expect@@ edly clear defeat at the Saar@@ land election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , more not , the comrades cal@@ med down at his time . &quot;
&quot; after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different . &quot;
this became even worse - and it became much worse .
&quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into action , the Düsseldorf bankrupt@@ cy w@@ rested the party smoothly . &quot;
&quot; pain@@ stak@@ ingly , the comrades appeared again in the weeks afterwards . &quot;
&quot; then , when they had just stepped up new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit of Hamburg came . &quot;
and with him came the next depression .
&quot; mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD leader , lost his Nim@@ bus at that weekend , because he was sitting in El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burning . &quot;
and because in crisis communication he did everything wrong with what you can do wrong .
&quot; since then , Schol@@ z has been fighting for his political survival . &quot;
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
&quot; due to the VW @-@ compliant affair and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Saxony Prime Minister has been in criticism for quite some time . &quot;
mi@@ ese survey values were added .
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because of that , Wei@@ l was trying to set accents in the Con@@ federation in the past few weeks . &quot;
&quot; the efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin , comrades , did not remain hidden in the environment of Martin Schulz . &quot;
they let him grant him as they promised a stabili@@ zation of the party by Wei@@ l .
now the exact opposite could occur .
&quot; in doing so , Wei@@ l is at the bottom of no fault in the party @-@ internal constra@@ int of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens . &quot;
and Schulz already did not .
&quot; at times , comrades try to keep their own ranks closed . &quot;
&quot; their anger is directed against the Gre@@ ens , and above all for the apost@@ ate parliam@@ ent@@ arian T@@ v@@ ests . &quot;
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , as Mrs. T@@ life@@ jackets puts her own career preferences over the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the German editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. T@@ life@@ jackets is not elected as a direct candidate , but also on the country list of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens , so the Lower Saxon Parliament continues . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , compla@@ ins of an &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the vot@@ er &apos;s willingness four years ago was clear : the people have made Stephan Wei@@ l a prime minister , &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as the top candidate in the election of the Bundestag , the R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U member distor@@ ts the election result , &quot; Op@@ per@@ mann continued . &quot;
he called for the clari@@ fication of the background .
I want to know if there has been more or has given further commitments of the CD@@ U Nieder@@ sachsen .
subsi@@ dy for local core III
those who want to renov@@ ate their house in the years can soon get support from the country .
&quot; in addition , mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of St@@ eg City Development informed us on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ ind@@ ler gave a review of what has been happening so far . &quot;
&quot; since 1991 , I have been giving in sensi@@ ti@@ sing areas of rehabilitation . &quot;
&quot; at that time , in the development area I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount . &quot;
&quot; in the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the surplus was still 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the previous renov@@ ations are a &quot; &quot; successful project &quot; &quot; - it is also important to promote internal development , not only to open up new areas of construction . &quot;
&quot; on April 4 , the government pres@@ i@@ dium Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a re@@ development area III . &quot;
&quot; the funding amount was 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 Euro , of which 500 000 euros would come from the country , the rest of the commune &apos;s sensi@@ bilities . &quot;
how does a remedi@@ ation area arise ?
&quot; so Sch@@ ind@@ ler will continue to investigate where the &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot;
&quot; but it also plays a role , whether in the planned area , there is interest at all to rehabil@@ itate . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , the territorial boundaries could then also be postpon@@ ed again . &quot;
&quot; the bridge was represented on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel . &quot;
&quot; cellar presented the contents of the federal government program &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; , &quot; in which the rehabil@@ itations would then be carried out . &quot;
&quot; core of the program is the re@@ vit@@ alization of inner cities , improving living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would be carried out object @-@ related , i.e. per property . &quot;
the re@@ development area would then be defined as a statute .
the approval period for funding runs since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
&quot; until September this year , however , the inventory took place only once , within the scope of which the participants had a questionnaire to fill out the questionnaire . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , the statute will take place as soon as possible , so that the re@@ struc@@ tur@@ ings can begin next year . &quot;
&quot; afterwards , Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann explained that every Commune needed to carry out the aforementioned preliminary investigations . &quot;
&quot; it is about assessing the urban@@ istic gri@@ ev@@ ances , and deciding when to refurb@@ ish and to what extent . &quot;
there will also be a re@@ development notice in the land register for the respective plot .
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again after sensation and make a picture of the situation , she promised . &quot;
Got@@ zel emphas@@ ised that the project is a key success factor for the project .
&quot; for this reason , there will be questionn@@ aires sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be completed by the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; building and land arc &quot; , &quot; in which it is about the structural condition and the renovation plans . &quot;
&quot; in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; household and housing arch , &quot; information on size , seg@@ mentation and residents of a living room can be made . &quot;
the blue &quot; operating arc &quot; is only to be filled out when operating premises in the building .
&quot; however , to be observed , Got@@ zel indicated that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , new construction measures are not eligible . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ ind@@ ler insi@@ sted that the distribution of the subsidies for the &quot; &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und @-@ principle &quot; &quot; function - who comes first , first grin@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; one cannot &quot; reserve funds for later &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; finally , photographs of the project &quot; &quot; Town Core II &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a renovation &quot; tasty . &quot; &quot;
British inventor himself has a micro@@ chip to come into house and car with a hand movement
&quot; a British inventor is the first in the country , equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement . &quot;
&quot; Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an an@@ aes@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist in the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to medical standards . &quot;
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
&quot; Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am wants to change the locks of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for an additional cost of £ 300 per lock . &quot;
&quot; the married father of one now has installed both at home and his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel . &quot;
the advertising costs of the White House cost the tax@@ pa@@ yers thousands
&quot; the White House &apos;s decision to fly a Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlights American production last month costs tax@@ pa@@ yers according to the military information provided to the TI@@ ME magazine , up to $ 24@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17 at the White House with American building programs . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tru@@ mp , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and executive officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries . &quot;
&quot; built in Connec@@ ti@@ cut , the helicopter was placed next to a Ma@@ ine Yacht , a Wis@@ con@@ sin fire@@ fighter and a for@@ klift from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; the White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; &quot; wrote the H@@ MX @-@ 1 commander on the eve of the event to his superior , the deputy commander of Nav@@ al Aviation . &quot;
the message showed that the helicopter arrived at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning on the South La@@ wn for the event at 3@@ pm and until the grass was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 this evening .
&quot; the note adds that if the departure from the White House was delayed , a second crew would be required for the return flight due to the limitation of the service hours . &quot;
&quot; the original flight crew was during the event at the helicopter , while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the aircraft . &quot;
&quot; from the records provided by the TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required . &quot;
the H@@ atch Act for@@ bi@@ ds federal states to use state property for political purposes .
datas@@ ets indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked if the event could viol@@ ate the destination .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; wrote the command@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; &quot; answered the deputy commander . &quot;
&quot; the event &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot;
but official events also have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the President gave an impetus to the reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate and he propag@@ ated the efforts to cur@@ b government regulations . &quot;
&quot; the use of the aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon from politically advantageous purposes . &quot;
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the journey .
&quot; but to demand their use only for a photo surgery , is unusual . &quot;
&quot; in February , Tru@@ mp conducted an investigation when the presidential plane was in front of his first Kamp@@ ag@@ nen@@ r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of news compla@@ ining about the use of the presidential jet by his predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is delighted by the show &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; said the deputy secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws frequently perform training flights in the area around Washington and in the South La@@ wn to set off the U.S. President in the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
&quot; when Tru@@ mp was on the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 in the White House conducted 58 practice land@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event counted for the training needs of the flight crew for the month , said a civil servant . &quot;
&quot; helicop@@ ters also flew 11 hours this day for &quot; &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pa@@ yers seized the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of Si@@ kor@@ sky said that the company had not been involved in exhibiting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not run budget labels for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ ari@@ fen of the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per hour . &quot;
records of the unit list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Quanti@@ co in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pa@@ yers based on estimates for reimbur@@ sement rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds . &quot;
&quot; according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the ref@@ ills for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but also take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the former press spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present things that are produced in America this week , &quot; Sp@@ ic@@ er said . &quot;
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ ti@@ cut are very proud to contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people are dependent on it . &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicop@@ ters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; of course , it is appropriate to emphasize that . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear whether Tru@@ mp inter@@ acted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire station car . &quot;
&quot; in the White House , Tru@@ mp spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and jo@@ king with the media about his own fleet of company products . &quot;
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; &quot; said the president , &quot; &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of a tricky task
top riders of the second tennis league compete in the Tab@@ ellen@@ berg Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
the TC blue @-@ white Ne@@ uss will be appearing in Kiel on the table @-@ third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V tomorrow from 11 a.m. onwards .
&quot; despite the five games still flaw@@ less , the leader of the Second Tennis Club has gained the sense of reality . &quot;
team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay in any case has respect for the opponent .
this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation .
&quot; just at the rear positions I find the team very good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V , imports from the high north ensure above all . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to inserts in the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay , looking at Har@@ ri hel@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ sey ( all Denmark ) . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult for us . &quot;
&quot; you also need a good portion of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the north is convenient .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ four .
&quot; if the Fren@@ ch@@ man who is active at the Chall@@ enger tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella active Fren@@ ch@@ man does not succeed at the Bundes@@ liga @-@ game , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) is playing at the tournament in Czech Liber@@ ec for its first use this season . &quot;
the previously un@@ defeated chil@@ ene Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el was on the ball yesterday with the Bel@@ three V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski .
&quot; he should be in Kiel as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ owe , N@@ iel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgian Juli@@ en C@@ agn@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; after his two victories , last Sunday against the Club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could be back to the team again . &quot;
&quot; it is enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was still number one of the Junior World Ranking in January 2016 , does not fill the cad@@ re from the trainer &apos;s staff around Mari@@ us Z@@ ay . &quot;
how America can harm O@@ MV
Donald Tru@@ mp did not really feel happy when he signed his signature on Wednesday evening under the law to tigh@@ ten the sanctions against Russia .
&quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , &quot; the Congress contained a few &quot; constitutional provisions , &quot; he et@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels hur@@ led against the U.S. initiative . &quot;
&quot; after all , the draft plans to punish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot;
&quot; since then , investors from the O@@ MV are troubled , who jointly with other European companies have co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian Eastern Partnership North Stream 2 . &quot;
the Dro@@ h@@ ul@@ isse is huge .
&quot; nevertheless , it is too early for an assessment of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil corporation . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Donald Tru@@ mp himself would have to raise the sanctions by executive order . &quot;
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; the press &quot; has seen which the Group could rep@@ el , and which could really hurt it . &quot;
Nar@@ cos Staff@@ el 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is centered in the row of Net@@ fli@@ x
&quot; despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars killer reveals , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is far from over . &quot;
&quot; the seasons three and four were already confirmed by streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest villa@@ ins of the show . &quot;
&quot; with the third season , DE@@ A has directed its attention to the richest organization of drug trafficking in the world : the Cal@@ i cart@@ el . &quot;
&quot; led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 company &quot; only with more government bri@@ bes and violent actions . &quot;
&quot; Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ azar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) orders the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ ac@@ ote ) is located in New York . &quot;
&quot; in the newly released trailer , Pedro Pascal returns as J@@ avier Pe@@ ña , the guy who invites American and Colom@@ bian prosecution authorities to support the war on drugs . &quot;
&quot; other new actors are M@@ ati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Silv@@ est@@ re , Kerry bis@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro . &quot;
the third season of Nar@@ cos will start on September 1st .
roll backwards : the city provides 46 kitchen aids
the city again organis@@ es the K@@ ita lunch table itself .
with fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
the clock is turned back in the urban centres of kinder@@ gar@@ tens .
&quot; as of September 1 , the city of Kre@@ feld takes over food supplies in the urban kinder@@ gar@@ tens ( Kit@@ as ) . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy head of the youth welfare department , this is a good news : &quot; &quot; we were all very happy . &quot;
the cook continues to cook out of the house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and supplies freshly cooked ch@@ illed .
&quot; the city operates in the Kre@@ feld area 46 kinder@@ gar@@ tens , in 44 the children get a hot meal at lun@@ ch@@ time . &quot;
&quot; last year , 28@@ 00 children sat at the tables , and the need is constantly growing . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , not only children who are cared for 45 hours of the week , at the K@@ ita have lunch , &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour supervision , if children stay until 14 o &apos;clock . &quot;
&quot; 46 part @-@ time staff from the 1st of September have kitchen service : they warm up the supplied foods , supplement them with salad , raw vegetables and fruit , por@@ tioning the meal individually , leaving aside , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; Pom@@ mer@@ anz says . &quot;
the size - there are two @-@ group as well as sevent@@ een units - decides on the ho@@ ur@@ ly circum@@ ference .
&quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers are now part of the K@@ ita team , &quot; Pom@@ mer@@ anz says . &quot;
&quot; so they are much more involved , and it is easier for the hospital to implement pedago@@ gical concepts . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , it is also about eating heal@@ th@@ ily and cooking . &quot;
children should help prepare food .
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is useful .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a known force in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
cleaning of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - up to now also the task of the kitchen staff - will be done by special cleaning staff in the future .
&quot; this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides the quality improvement of the kitchen performance , has also the charm that it has shown in the cost comparison between self @-@ control and foreign publishing for the city as the most economical way , it is called the Press Office . &quot;
&quot; and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are re@@ configured . &quot;
&quot; but these hours are not so strong at about 750 persons in the education sector , &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN &quot;
&quot; elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Nicholas Hay@@ som , acting head of the United Nations mission , said that hundreds of women are going to run in the provinces . three women are fighting for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women . &quot;
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot;
elections can only be truly representative and credi@@ ble when women fully participate and be included in all parts of the election process .
Afghan elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on 5 April .
&quot; the Taliban has published threats against a choice process , which coinci@@ de with the transition from international battles to an advisory role . &quot;
&quot; this year , the elections for the first time will hand the power peac@@ efully from a democr@@ atically elected government to the next . &quot;
Hay@@ som said that a strong role for women will intensi@@ fy the democratic success of Afghanistan .
the Afghan Independent Elec@@ toral Commission reports that 1.2 million women of a total of registered 3.6 million voters were registered .

men try to ro@@ b 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl
two young men aged 19 and 23 years should have tried to ro@@ b a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl on Thursday .
&quot; according to the police , the men talked to the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who stopped with friends at Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße at 2 : 55 o &apos;clock , because they wanted to call on the phone of the girl . &quot;
&quot; the 13 @-@ year @-@ old refused the request , and went on with their friends . &quot;
&quot; as a result , one of the perpetr@@ ators tried to attack the girl &apos;s cell phone and the N@@ ec@@ kl@@ ace of the girl , but it failed . &quot;
without prey the du@@ et fled .
the two young men were later arrested by the police .
the investigations run .
G@@ MB concerns about investments in Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a union wants to make sure that the long @-@ term commitment to production at its plant in Glasgow is committed to managers of bis@@ cuit manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
G@@ MB Scotland said the company was silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
&quot; more than 500 employees work in the plant , which produces other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea bis@@ cuits . &quot;
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ in said he invested more than 5 million pounds in the last few years .
he added that employees and trade union representatives would &quot; experience first &quot; if their activities would change .
&quot; in a letter to the company &apos;s branch manager , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s calling for &quot; &quot; concerns &quot; &quot; is that financing for the modernis@@ ation of production lines is not being pushed forward . &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB senior organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; &quot; the fact that we cannot win clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross does not affect our members . &quot;
&quot; generations of families have worked here and the workers strongly concentrate on the local community and the Glasgow , an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and against the backdrop of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic production decline , the Eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a flour@@ ishing production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman from Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; the manager at T@@ oll@@ cross has received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland only yesterday , and the company will react directly to it , as we value the ongoing commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the employees that , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we constantly monitor our business - and this applies to all our business units and locations - to remain competitive . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; over the past few years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , particularly in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognise the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a place of production . if our operations are changing at the site , employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warn of N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the page of La League likes to regret their interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not abandon N@@ ey@@ mar following an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million in order to trigger his release clause , but have they warned Barcelona three years before the world record attack ? &quot;
&quot; the sensational approach has triggered the transfer window in summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than the double of the previous brand while Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the past season for 89 million pounds . &quot;
&quot; after finishing , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional sports@@ man in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of over 500@@ ,000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out , although there is a source near the Catal@@ ans mind that the club has always given his best to take care of him since his arrival in San@@ tos in 2013 . &quot;
but was the football world warned against this prospect three years ago by the PS@@ G President ?
&quot; when Manchester City was interested in signing Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strong warning for every club to sign one of PS@@ G &apos;s best players . &quot;
&quot; I am not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but if they try to sign one of our players , this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , whereby the Spanish club expressed interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ field player Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G made it clear that it would not allow the International from Italy to leave it under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price deals for N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot;
roller dis@@ car@@ ded and damaged
&quot; in the night of Friday on Saturday , an unknown offen@@ ders had deliberately dropped off a sco@@ oter in the Königs@@ feld road ahead of the estate number 30 and so on the disgu@@ ise of the vehicle was caused damage of more than 200 euros . &quot;
&quot; police Sch@@ ram@@ berg , telephone 07@@ 4@@ 22 / 27 01 @-@ 0 , ask for advice . &quot;
the police witnesses to an accident at the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese .
&quot; because he met a car in his lane , the driver had to do@@ dge a VW tour and tou@@ red the console . &quot;
on Thursday evening the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ L@@ occ@@ um was on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au with his VW at 19.@@ 55 o &apos;clock in the direction of Le@@ ese .
&quot; in the area of the village of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a passenger car met him on his road , so that he had to escape to the right . &quot;
the Tour@@ an drivers tou@@ red the console .
material damage was created on the passenger car .
&quot; the driver of the coming car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ taken a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident . &quot;
&quot; according to the accident report , it may be good that the motor @-@ cycl@@ ist did not notice the accident at all . &quot;
the police now ask witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the pol@@ lu@@ ter car to contact the comm@@ iss@@ ariat in Stol@@ zen@@ au under Tel . 0@@ 57@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 .
interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report reli@@ eves Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the mis@@ use cases is reli@@ eved by Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the mis@@ use sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen continues for discussions .
&quot; Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ man for the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; stated after publication in relation to the German press agency , he expected from the former Regensburg bishop and present @-@ day Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the Cathedral master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the rejected Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; it would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church , when Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger expressed their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or at that time false assessment of the events . &quot;
&quot; the Vatican newspaper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised that in reporting about violence among the dome @-@ cats with &quot; double standards . &quot; &quot;
&quot; no one doub@@ ted that it was &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts &quot; that would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; degree of media manipulation , &quot; the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics committee . &quot;
&quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as the source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis , too , said in an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; we are happy to go to the church and that is a spotted fres@@ co . &quot;
&quot; in addition , she pointed out that &quot; &quot; strikes have been a quite normal educational tool &quot; &quot; in her youth , &quot; &quot; to be done with che@@ ek@@ y children as I was one . &quot;
&quot; it would be unfair to apply today &apos;s standards to previous decades , as the world has changed . &quot;
&quot; in connection with reports on the abuse of abuse , pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared . &quot;
&quot; completely wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who wrote with R@@ atz@@ inger the mem@@ or@@ abili@@ a &quot; &quot; My brother of the pop@@ e &quot; &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report submitted by the B@@ ist@@ um Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment German lawyer Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger dom@@ spar@@ rows were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; victims of attacks , 67 domain cats . &quot;
&quot; in the final report , it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can be said that R. Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. has used forms of physical and psychological violence in many cases . &quot;
especially with high emotion@@ ality the punishment for the students could also be more intense .
&quot; in contrast to numerous other defend@@ ants , however , many victims argue that many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , even positive memories with him in spite of violence . &quot;
&quot; in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the mis@@ use sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was reli@@ eved . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the incidents of abuse of violence against the &quot; Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , &quot; is a contradictory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , many students highlight his &quot; humanity . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he also appears as a ch@@ oline and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , who became tangible by the eye when a domain of music did not bring top performance musi@@ cally . &quot;
how do you evaluate this final report as its bi@@ ographer ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : if you make the effort and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is found at all . &quot;
he is devoted just once to eight pages and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspicion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the exc@@ esses at the pre @-@ school were also ex@@ propri@@ ated outside of his sphere of influence .
&quot; at best , one can repro@@ ach him of having heard of it too late or not having taken first indications seriously enough . &quot;
&quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um , on which it worked , was felt by practically all respon@@ dents as - literally - &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the broad majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also presents an excellent testimony , describing him as &quot; warm @-@ hearted , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as an extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and candy and &quot; always surrounded by grapes from children . &quot; &quot;
&quot; only a minority compla@@ ins about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his high emotion@@ ality , which also led to break@@ through@@ s . &quot;
&quot; he did not only kne@@ el with chairs and threw the keys on the floor , but also par@@ ted ear@@ posts and too che@@ ek@@ y guys on the hair or ears , he himself had already admitted years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it . &quot;
&quot; to his salvation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the question@@ able time , the 1960s and the 1970s , both parents and teachers . &quot;
do you still know such breeding methods ?
&quot; of course , I think each of us who was born before 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I have also experienced this in a secular school , a state Gymnasium . &quot;
&quot; compared to what is actually going on in this report , namely the horri@@ fic sexual abuse and the exc@@ esses of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , that is , of course , Bag@@ at@@ ella . &quot;
&quot; you wonder if it &apos;s not with his fame and his role as brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media have just r@@ ushed to him . &quot;
&quot; at the Bavarian Pope , many who have never understood him are still ze@@ al@@ ous . &quot;
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves George R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
&quot; in the media , in connection with the report a lot has been reported on the topic of abuse at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger see any involvement or complic@@ ity in regard to sexual abuse in the final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : clearly no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to be entrusted with the master &apos;s master .
not even the parents were consecrated .
&quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or my mother about it , &quot; &quot; said an affected person on behalf of the others , &quot; &quot; it was all very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot;
&quot; the real problem in the education of sexual abuse , however , is that most victims are silent . &quot;
&quot; if they didn &apos;t even commit themselves to parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then definitely not a ch@@ oral leader , who would have been professionally a colleague of the perpetr@@ ators . &quot;
how do we evaluate R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in the context of the abuse of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student put it this way : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I do not see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) would have had timely knowledge and could have been able to stop the respective perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; I consider it ... also for really absurd to assume that all of it would have opened up to him ... boys more penet@@ r@@ able or clearer , or rather opened more than to their parents , boarding teachers , trust teachers , etc . &quot;
that you talk to him about sex ... un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the report concludes with the clear result : &quot; that the student and / or their environment entrusted to him in the run @-@ up could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation . &quot;
&quot; as for sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is therefore free to speak of any sympathy . &quot;
&quot; in this way , he cannot be accused of being prevented or killed . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there is no reason to establish its good name with these conflic@@ ting crimes , as it happened in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media , there was much talk of &quot; violence exc@@ esses &quot; at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the former master master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is presented in the report &quot; &quot; Wa@@ iting to look &quot; . &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem in reporting everything mixed and mixed up to a huge amount of sexual abuse and violence , and somewhere in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
but exactly this is an abuse of the report .
&quot; there is a clean separation between the pre @-@ school and the secondary school of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and violence , as well as we say once , other alleg@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; the report also deals with incidents from the period since 1945 , so also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not the choir director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the whole aw@@ ful test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases in which boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were victi@@ mi@@ zed and painted , and among them were app@@ alling , ex@@ propri@@ ated all at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have reigned . &quot;
&quot; however , with them Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys first to face when they were already on the gy@@ nec@@ ologist gymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; on that , as most of the witnesses emphasize , the subject of &quot; &quot; pre @-@ school &quot; &quot; tab@@ oo . &quot;
one was only happy to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; paradise &quot; conditions .
what was different from the gymn@@ asi@@ um gymn@@ asi@@ um ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline already , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence . &quot;
&quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and , therefore , in many cases even positive memories with him in spite of violence . &quot;
&quot; at the most , the repro@@ ach remains to have looked out . &quot;
&quot; however , despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre @-@ school . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was not working and was responsible , ( so the witness ) didn &apos;t want to hear anything , and then only back in 1993 . &quot;
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently hide the ears from the states ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um , who even reproduced the report . &quot;
&quot; in this he points out this , &quot; that the exam@@ iner will continue to practice the punishment in the pre @-@ school . &quot;
&quot; already in view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent intervention . &quot;
&quot; this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , as Prü@@ fer &apos;s pen@@ alties in Bavaria have long since been banned . &quot;
&quot; before that , they acquired a legal grey area , as each one of us knows still . &quot;
&quot; it was hard to estimate for him , where those affected were perhaps exagger@@ ated or dram@@ ati@@ zed , and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded . &quot;
&quot; but you can &apos;t say , he always looked away . &quot;
this is simply not true .
&quot; only in 1980 , the punishment of schools in Bavaria was officially abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis asser@@ ted that it was unfair to apply today &apos;s educational standards to the time at that time . &quot;
how do you see that ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we historians are talking about the &quot; &quot; pit@@ falls of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; , &quot; i.e. the danger of assessing the past according to today &apos;s moral standards . &quot;
the princess is right there .
&quot; but this of course does not apply to sexual abuse , which has been ab@@ hor@@ red at all times and also not for what has been verb@@ alized in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond the usual practice . &quot;
it &apos;s all very aw@@ ful and I &apos;m glad that it will finally be worked out .
&quot; but at the same time , I have to take protection from Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all this had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; his means of discipl@@ ining and punishment , so to draw ear@@ nest and to the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; when physical punishment was forbidden , he was strictly adher@@ ed to . &quot;
&quot; what picture of his Regensburg time has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger played in the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; My brother of the pop@@ e &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
was the subject of testing also available for speech ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI tells from his perspective , there the Cathedral spar@@ rows played only a minor role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I do not conc@@ eal that he led a strict regi@@ ment there . &quot;
&quot; but this also has to be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without requiring un@@ condition@@ ally discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world drinking from the hitherto quite nation@@ ally famous Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cuits and can@@ dies alone you don &apos;t even make a big singer and stand before every success , regardless of the area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming . &quot;
what kind of people did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger experienced during the talks with her book ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , I really got to know Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and again and again experienced as wonderful , humor@@ ous , fundamental , deeply believing and heart@@ felt people , from whom you can &apos;t imagine that he could only do something for a fly . &quot;
&quot; I regularly receive regular contact with him , like many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , 23 years after his imprisonment , visit him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those who do not forgive him until this day , that he once was stern to them , are clearly in the minority . &quot;
most of the cathedral cats are thank@@ ful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought them near to the world of music .
&quot; and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lov@@ able respect@@ ful person , to whom they still look up and whom they almost rever@@ e . &quot;
&quot; and please , again clearly : all you repro@@ ach him are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time . &quot;
we can be glad that we have long over@@ came this time .
&quot; but it is most un@@ just , a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
&quot; there is the evil intention behind it , all too obvious . &quot;
&quot; for the report , which has just been published , reli@@ eves him . &quot;
&quot; now the war would stop , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has earned great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany nobody would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace . &quot;
