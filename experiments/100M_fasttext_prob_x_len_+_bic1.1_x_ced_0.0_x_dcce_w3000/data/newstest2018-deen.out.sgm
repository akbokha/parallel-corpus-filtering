<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irish institution where young people should meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A chapel which is now dug for the S-Bahn (S-Bahn) tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Gardeners are cultivating the rusty ground of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories.</seg>
<seg id="6">It gets nervous when maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everyone who had to get upset because the car navigation device was showing a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportal Bavaria of the state government, are anything but current - but very revealing."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how towns and municipalities have changed in the spread-area of the Munich-based Merkur since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a patchwork rug that one does not recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the large overview map, more detailed maps, so-called" "rulings" "were incorporated for cities and municipalities."</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the Bavarian surveying business between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographical survey of Bavaria, of course for military purposes."</seg>
<seg id="17">"even if the French troops finally removed the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801, it was the neighbours of today who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria card."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Elector Max IV Joseph drove the project forward, founded the" Topographic Bureau "- and thus the Bavarian surveying management."</seg>
<seg id="19">The dial for Munich comes from the year 1856 and is to be found on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek (Bavarian State Library).</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of early / Today is most impressive in the example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">"an example of this is the subsendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856."</seg>
<seg id="23">"it was built 21 years after the map was created, thus in 1877, as part of the Munich borough."</seg>
<seg id="24">"today, the city is located in the middle of the city."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses of Untersendling are concentrated around 1856 along the present Plinganserstraße, which was first named after George Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: when zooming in appears a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten numbered plots from the so-called" "primitive" "from which the basic tax was derived."</seg>
<seg id="27">"today, small plots of land don't show farmers anymore - but gardeners of the plant" Land in Sonne. ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Theresienwiese, since 1810 the scene of the Oktoberfest, was in fact a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete fringe."</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other hand of Isar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name" at the Gasteig "or from the hill" Auf der Lüfte "- but also in large letters" Irren Anstalt. ""</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße one once closed people with delusions."</seg>
<seg id="33">"in 1858 / 59 the Munich-based Irrenanstalt" "Auf der Auer Lüfte" "was created there."</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Guden led the institution - that psychiatrist, who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was progressive for his time, and, for example, ended the accusations of so-called madmen."</seg>
<seg id="36">"he also prohibited the personnel to use violence against the occupants," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who worked for an exhibition with the institution. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"for 280 patients it was first place, later it was extended to 500 places."</seg>
<seg id="38">"at some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreiserrenanstalt in the hair of 1905."</seg>
<seg id="39">"since 2006, the Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost, one of the largest psychiatriums in Germany, has been located there since 2006."</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people meet in Salesianum in Munich on the grounds of the former Auer Anstalt.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order purchased the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with educational establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">"West lies the football field of the TSV Munich East, east of residential buildings from the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015, the children's house" Casa Don Bosco "was built - in architectural reference to the original construction of the Irrenanstalt, which was destroyed during the Second World War in bombing raids."</seg>
<seg id="44">"the Marienplatz was registered as" "main square" "around 1856, the Kaufingerstraße was called" "Kaufinger Gasse". ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">"in December 1944, the Allies bombed many holes in the inner city."</seg>
<seg id="47">A big one remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the English institute, small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages were once held at the Marienhof, where these days were the preparatory work and on 5 April 2017 the ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn track."</seg>
<seg id="49">"with the slider, you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof."</seg>
<seg id="50">Ombudsman publishes travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the Promotion of Farms has issued a warning for coloured people who are travelling to Missouri due to discriminatory politics and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which will enter into force by August 28, 2017, invites afro-American travelers, visitors and Missouri to pay special attention when traveling through the state, as a number of questionable, rapid-based occurrences occur recently throughout the state and noted here," says the Group's opinion. "</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes people harder to gain discrimination, as well as prosecuting authorities of the state that disproportionate minorities, prompted the group to publish the warning message, said the NAACP."</seg>
<seg id="54">They have violations of the civil rights that people pass.</seg>
<seg id="55">"the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star, said, because of their skin colour."</seg>
<seg id="56">We listen to complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group cited incidents such as racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no longer any fuel during the journey and was taken into custody by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also points to a recent report by the Office of the Attorney General of Missouri, in which it is shown that black motorists in the state will be 75 percent more likely to be considered whitewashed."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," says Chapel. "</seg>
<seg id="62">"people need to be ready to bring money, or let the relatives know that they travel through the state."</seg>
<seg id="63">"in 2015 Missouri posted 100 hate crimes, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime program, which states the state with respect to the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">"the warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law, which would make it more difficult to accuse a company for housing or employment discrimination."</seg>
<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states had adopted immigration laws that local law enforcement authorities pledge to arrest people due to immigration offences, which will contribute to further race profiling."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">Electric fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischerbacher Weideconfence Project is a successful project and will be continued in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Parliamentarians Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac have provided a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">"at the vaulted yard of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the fisher's CDU-location meet together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies."</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann first gave insights into his farm, where he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of woods, supplies 40 milk cows and also many young animals and houses the holiday guests in five apartments."</seg>
<seg id="72">"the" Black Forest "is the alternative marketing path for the milk of its cows, so Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="73">Only Regionales arrive at the table of the holiday guests.</seg>
<seg id="74">"since he is also the BLHV president of Fischerbach, he described the electric fence project as" elementary important. ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I can't manage profitably on such steep areas.</seg>
<seg id="76">"the grassland area care for a lot of work, much has to be processed with the brushcutter."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have to fight here with the conditions and with the topography," said Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003, he took over the parental operation and managed this without any chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he did not conduct biocides."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" the Commune has recognised the importance of the electric fence project and is happy about its leader support. "</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">I hope that the reforestation of the areas could be pulled out quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they carry on their operation," "said the Mayor."</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often criticized for their support</seg>
<seg id="84">"in 2013, a total of 25 parcels were fenced off by eleven participants."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the exhibition area is 40 hectares, which cannot be forested until at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"half of the total cost of 71 500 Euro was supported by half of the leaders, one quarter contributed to the municipality of Fischerbach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus, the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of fence."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the big advantage is the durability of the fences," said Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac stressed:" "you do a really good job without farmers and landlords."</seg>
<seg id="90">"Peter Weiss also said:" "here the best food is produced." ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The state sponsorship policy (LPR) Baden-Württemberg provides government support for fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to maintain the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The precondition is the presence of a conveying system designated by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">"moreover, the fence must not be smuggable (slope above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by reforestation."</seg>
<seg id="95">"for the fisher's fences project 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build almost 16 kilometres of fence, is currently underway."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the exhibition area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing sacred?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes up the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans value these as much as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos place in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated argument with Jim Acosta from CNN on the proposals of the President for the drastic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to stay fair, Miller didn't handle the statue herself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and liberty imitators would have raged him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he took their meaning, and especially the meaning that was attributed to her when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to his base."</seg>
<seg id="105">"when Miller Acosta complained," I don't want to enter a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illumines the world. "</seg>
<seg id="106">"the poem which you refer to, which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is properly speaking, but as he formulated it himself, it is not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary response to the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor:" your weary, your poor, / your afflicted masses who long to breathe freely, / the miserable waste of your rich coasts. "</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time when the "eleventh apostasy" was better seen on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict due to the significance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural debate: it is indeed a conflict about the meaning of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and their friends who advocated to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they performed a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicanism by portraying the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical illustration.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of the exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and just as Lazarus changed the significance of the statue, the people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the great cry of Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty calls no one but rather an early neo-conservative who brings the American flame to the surrounding world:" Lady Liberty proceeds. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It is intended to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not illuminate the way to the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh stumbled upon something here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by exhausted, elearning, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"in the truest sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">"and that is, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump will ever recognize."</seg>
<seg id="127">"their torch should not illuminate the way, but the hatred which is their only source of power."</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the Great Britain Team</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two Scots belonged to the United Kingdom Team</seg>
<seg id="130">"the Industrial Relations Director of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent on the World Cup will make a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 which kicks off on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">Black believes that "in Scotland" something special develops "and the United Kingdom's athletics have to learn something from it.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it and we try to understand it, and we will continue it until we find it out," "Black said."</seg>
<seg id="134">I speak to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes are medallions candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who are competing against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m course while Eilidh Doyle was elected team captain by the team."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "Eilidh is fairly modest."</seg>
<seg id="141">"her speech was incredible," Black says. "</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh naturally brought in were great.</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will compete with her fifth world championships at the 400 m hurdles, says that it is" incredible "that 16 Scots are in the UK team."</seg>
<seg id="145">"Scotland's hitherto best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015."</seg>
<seg id="146">"in the past year, the Muir midrange runners are leading five British and two European records."</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman to watch for a great season that included the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers her first world championships as the only other Scotsman in Team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the team captain says they are" hugely proud "of the fact that many of their compatriots not only belong to the team, but in some cases also be mixed with the medals and at the finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and chose me, makes it something very special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I am very proud of all the Scots belonging to the team."</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb on podiums."</seg>
<seg id="155">What about my speech as captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think she went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to rely on this home support and benefit from being back in the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go out there and compete and there will be just such a great atmosphere out there.</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking Critics on Facebook: don't worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate the electorate of voters.</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something from bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long until the newspapers beat him because of everything from domestic politics to his political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">"he complained in criticism, certainly."</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"for in the year 1783, Washington said:" freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and silent, we are led like sheep to slaughter. "</seg>
<seg id="166">"that brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans's employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union accused him of the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the governor's staff dismissed the suit as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a counter reaction with" Na, and?. ""</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's only Facebook," many people said. "</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">"this is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state, which is amazingly popular."</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest agreement of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary flushead.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and decipher his hair-less head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, the blocking of persons coming to the governor's side - which is a public forum that is officially designated and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars, is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans nurse Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the governor and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the picture of trolls or spammers or hassle-filled people who oscillate online the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The Post spoke to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"and these are just real people who speak to their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane."</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to the Catholic faith of Hogans.</seg>
<seg id="185">"lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I was polite that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the commentary section of the news broadcast "The Post." "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I also don't appreciate this idea when a number of people take a position on the same subject, then they are disregarded by some rather than a so-called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the staff of the Governor referred to as" "concentrated spam" "would probably call" "intercession". ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is much cleaner than in earlier times, if one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles and to arrest demonstrators and silence them."</seg>
<seg id="191">But exactly that just happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official who criticises Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is accused of Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this issue fell last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County passed the First Amendment, according to US district judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they banned a voter from their Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">"and in Kentucky, governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit to ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at the time of Washington, the time of affordable Portos had a similar effect on the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous mail-recorders hit his lead."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">"people who used pseudonyms such as" juricola, "" Valerius, "" Belisarius "and" Portius, "wrote all letters to newspapers who made Washington decisions."</seg>
<seg id="202">"petitions, who criticized his position on the treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with Great Britain, overwhelmed his office, according to historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he did not silence them.</seg>
<seg id="204">"freedom of speech, disagreement and discourses are the basis of our nation."</seg>
<seg id="205">And true leadership means accepting this.</seg>
<seg id="206">Ronan Rafferty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club</seg>
<seg id="207">"the former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for domestic comfort over the next three days, since the Renaissance Club in East Lothian will host the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open."</seg>
<seg id="208">"the Nordire, who passed the Archerfield Links to the final round last year, before he lost against Paul Eales, is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the founder and CEOs Jerry Sarvadi."</seg>
<seg id="209">"I've seen how the Renaissance club was built, and we see how he achieved his fame with this event," "said Rafferty."</seg>
<seg id="210">"the players will see this course from his best side, he is in a great condition."</seg>
<seg id="211">Jerry made a great job when he found this place.</seg>
<seg id="212">He is a diligent supporter of this game and is proud of his performance here.</seg>
<seg id="213">This is a great showcase for this course. "</seg>
<seg id="214">"the Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, although he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career."</seg>
<seg id="215">"that feels really special," said the player based in Southport. "</seg>
<seg id="216">I have not been able to defend the Extremadura Open since it was taken out of the program in the year after I had won it.</seg>
<seg id="217">Coming back to this part of the world is magical.</seg>
<seg id="218">It is a wonderful place to play golf.</seg>
<seg id="219">"the memories from last year come back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win last year here."</seg>
<seg id="220">It was a really special time and one we will always appreciate.</seg>
<seg id="221">"Gary Orr, who came to European Senior Tour after his 50th birthday earlier this year, returns to the action on his home ground."</seg>
<seg id="222">This event will be its first Scottish performance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="223">"it always means a little more when you play at home," said Orr, the man from Helensburgh. "</seg>
<seg id="224">"you want to do it well, but you also feel this additional pressure."</seg>
<seg id="225">I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf.</seg>
<seg id="226">I am happy about how far it has gone.</seg>
<seg id="227">"the trio on the field are the former Masters champion Ian Woosnam and Senior Champion Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNyer."</seg>
<seg id="228">"the former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance is one of the six Scotsman on the field, the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond."</seg>
<seg id="229">"entrance is free, the parking place costs £5 per car with a passenger and £10 per car with two or more passengers."</seg>
<seg id="230">All proceeds go to Prostate Cancer UK.</seg>
<seg id="231">Less lung cancer due to passive smoking</seg>
<seg id="232">Fewer and fewer people died in lung cancer over the past two decades.</seg>
<seg id="233">Scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) come to this conclusion in a study.</seg>
<seg id="234">"according to our estimates, 167 lung cancer cases are attributed to passive smoking," "said Dr. Heiko Becher."</seg>
<seg id="235">"as a comparison, he drew up his own study on this subject from 1994."</seg>
<seg id="236">"at that time, there were still 400 lung cancer cases given by passive smoking per year in Germany."</seg>
<seg id="237">The new study is published in the "International Journal of Public Health."</seg>
<seg id="238">House connections prove to be very complex</seg>
<seg id="239">"the construction works in the Villinger Straße are in full swing and" "are reasonably in time," "said the director of the court Fred Heinze."</seg>
<seg id="240">"in the area of the house connections, the location is more complicated than expected, as there is a lot of mountains in the underground, which is not noted in the plans."</seg>
<seg id="241">"traffic, which is constantly hampered by the construction work, is a big problem for the company Stumpp."</seg>
<seg id="242">"the ignorance of motorists from red lights and shut-outs is already enormous," Heinze reports. "</seg>
<seg id="243">The road is locked and only the regular buses are allowed to drive through.</seg>
<seg id="244">"Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from Stumpp have been working on the bridge for weeks."</seg>
<seg id="245">"" "the hot days were quite exhausting."</seg>
<seg id="246">"but fortunately we were provided by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water," Marvin Kostorz tells. "</seg>
<seg id="247">Poverty and death in the Indonesian goldland</seg>
<seg id="248">"when Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove."</seg>
<seg id="249">It even rarely uses a pot.</seg>
<seg id="250">"in her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai Regentship in the unpeaceful Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife normally places a sweet potato - locally called" nota "- directly in the fireplace."</seg>
<seg id="251">"after half an hour, the stolen tuber is removed with zealous, unwashed hands and swallowed."</seg>
<seg id="252">Degei sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work such as washing clothes with cloudy water from the nearby marsh.</seg>
<seg id="253">A bucket in a homeless space serves as latrine.</seg>
<seg id="254">"as the youngest of the four wives of her husband, her fields were not assigned to her."</seg>
<seg id="255">Polygamy is common here.</seg>
<seg id="256">"of course it can be dangerous to work late: most villagers are unemployed, and many drink heavy, and there are the soldiers here."</seg>
<seg id="257">"nobody dares to run around in the village after 17 o'clock," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="258">"it is a rare insight into the daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was recorded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia when only 1,026 elders had to vote by a public raising in front of the occupying troops."</seg>
<seg id="259">"an existing movement, which stirred up for independence against Dutch rule, quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, which maintains control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers from it."</seg>
<seg id="260">"in 2003, the Province was officially distributed in Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea the eastern part of the island."</seg>
<seg id="261">The journey includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire and then a morning 5 hour drive by car.</seg>
<seg id="262">There is no public transportation.</seg>
<seg id="263">"the town with 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and made of corrugated board roofs, which were converted by rust into various yellow-brown tones."</seg>
<seg id="264">"only very few Indonesians have made their journey here, let alone journalists and practically no foreigner."</seg>
<seg id="265">"before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshipped a god named Uga Tamee."</seg>
<seg id="266">There were also other changes.</seg>
<seg id="267">"we were not used to wearing these clothes," Degei says, pointing to her lively, handwoven turban, her dark shirt and her bright rock. "</seg>
<seg id="268">"in the past, we had only sheets on our bodies."</seg>
<seg id="269">"Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia."</seg>
<seg id="270">But it is also Indonesian Goldland.</seg>
<seg id="271">"the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grassberg, owned by Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is located only 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province in the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="272">"in 2015 alone, Freeport mined gold and copper in the value of USD 3.1 billion."</seg>
<seg id="273">"in addition, Papua has wood resources worth $78 billion worth of dollars."</seg>
<seg id="274">"these wealth, however, are a source of misery for Papua, ensuring that Indonesia's powerful military keeps a stifling presence."</seg>
<seg id="275">"a study from 2005 in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units of nearly 20 million US dollars between 1998 and 2004, including up to 150,000 dollars in one officer."</seg>
<seg id="276">Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten those golden goose and are treated mercilessly.</seg>
<seg id="277">"according to activists, more than 500,000 jobs were killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned since 1969 by the Indonesian military."</seg>
<seg id="278">Mass killings in Papuas's tribal land in the 1970-s have been committed to genocide in accordance with the Asia Human Rights Commission.</seg>
<seg id="279">"in the region alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful demonstrators last year."</seg>
<seg id="280">"we" "Do everything" "in a report of the Brisbane archdiocese in 2016, in which reports about atrocities of the previous year are included, such as unlawful killings and torture - rape and electric shootings are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations."</seg>
<seg id="281">"it's difficult to count the number of victims since every week incidents occur," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesian researcher for Human Rights Watch. "</seg>
<seg id="282">"bolts have increased, as Papuas resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia."</seg>
<seg id="283">"the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but demographic developments are changing since Muslim economic migrants come from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi."</seg>

<seg id="286">"the migrants started selling chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local," Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai local native to the province capital Jayapura. "</seg>
<seg id="287">"it has cost the native Papua, the Mama-Mama [the women] of Papua, their market."</seg>
<seg id="288">"the Indonesian president Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, promised to tackle inequalities and violations of law in Papua during his campaign in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="289">"the former carpenter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Paniai, on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta."</seg>
<seg id="290">"but in Papua, little has changed, and today the locals feel betrayed."</seg>
<seg id="291">"our hearts are broken, because we voted for Jokowi in 2014, with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored," "says You."</seg>
<seg id="292">"in fact, only two months after Jokovo's inauguration in October, Paniai suffered a low point."</seg>
<seg id="293">"on December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas carols in front of a campfire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle."</seg>
<seg id="294">The frightened children told them that they should turn their headlights on.</seg>
<seg id="295">"one of the soldiers took offense at their sound and later came back with four soldiers, so the local pastor Yavedt Tebai."</seg>
<seg id="296">"the soldiers who had drunk, chased and beat the group with their rifles, said victims and witnesses."</seg>
<seg id="297">Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of the children.</seg>
<seg id="298">"a child, the 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was so badly beaten that he fell into coma."</seg>
<seg id="299">A few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day.</seg>
<seg id="300">"about 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered on a football field in front of the local police station and the Military Command Centre to demand justice."</seg>
<seg id="301">They carried ceremonial hunting bows and led the Waita dance - running in the circle and initiating a bird song - from Papuas Mee Pago-tribe.</seg>
<seg id="302">Some demonstrators began to throw stones on police and military posts.</seg>
<seg id="303">"when the mood was heated, the soldiers were sent a command over an internal funk:" if the masses stand more than three times, they shoot them dead, "it says in an official document of TIME, which was not released to the local media."</seg>
<seg id="304">"Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto neighborhood of Enarotali, saw the impending danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home."</seg>
<seg id="305">Nobody was in the mood to listen.</seg>
<seg id="306">"when I turned around, I was suddenly shot into my left wrist," "he said TIME on the porch of his colorful painted wooden house."</seg>
<seg id="307">"Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but says that the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here."</seg>
<seg id="308">"it was crowded, many shots were fired," "he adds."</seg>
<seg id="309">"the native man Alfius Youw was hit three times, so his cousin, the witness of shooting."</seg>
<seg id="310">"I ran to him and tried his body to be sure he was," "said Yohanes, who just like many Indonesians only bears a name, the TIME in a dark mood."</seg>
<seg id="311">I saw that he was dead... I kissed him.</seg>
<seg id="312">"the chief inspector of the Papua police, Yotje Mende, reports that his officers wanted to" secure "their station only because they were attacked."</seg>

<seg id="314">"it's about life and death."</seg>
<seg id="315">"according to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many others were injured."</seg>
<seg id="316">The news about the killings came only the following day 'filtered' to Jakarta.</seg>
<seg id="317">"three weeks, Jokowi in Jayapura gave a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and swore to tackle the historical grievances in Papua."</seg>
<seg id="318">"I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="319">"in October 2016, Minister of Security, Wiranto, said that he had an out-of-court mechanism for settling historical human rights violations."</seg>
<seg id="320">But the excuses began almost immediately.</seg>
<seg id="321">"most injuries have occurred a long time ago.</seg>
<seg id="322">Some were in the 90's and the beginning of the 2000-s.</seg>
<seg id="323">"the point is that we have committed ourselves to addressing these violations, but there are processes that must go through," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="324">Then Wiranto made a retreat when he spoke to TIME on 5 June in Jakarta and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.</seg>
<seg id="325">"instead, everything is regulated by law," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="326">"Wiranto, who charged the UN for" crimes against humanity "that demanded more than 1,000 victims of death in East Timor's bloody independence vote, said that 11 cases of human rights violations have already been settled in Papua, including the paniai incident."</seg>
<seg id="327">Families of the Paniai victims accepted such claims with a fiery integrity.</seg>
<seg id="328">"I was interviewed four times over the last three years, but there was no progress," says Yohanes. "</seg>
<seg id="329">"I am tired."</seg>
<seg id="330">He says he still lives in fear years later.</seg>
<seg id="331">"I'm afraid," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="332">"I am afraid of being arrested by the military, I fear being shot."</seg>
<seg id="333">His brother Yacey repeated the belief that people in Paniai fear to discuss the incident.</seg>
<seg id="334">He says he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims.</seg>
<seg id="335">"after I buried the corpses, the military looked for me," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="336">The shootings have not ceased.</seg>
<seg id="337">On Tuesday the Indonesian police fired on villagers in the Paniais neighborhood of Deiyai.</seg>
<seg id="338">"during a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring a unconscious man to the hospital, one person and 17 others were injured, including children."</seg>

<seg id="341">The police said that the villagers threw stones on officers who responded by firing a warning.</seg>
<seg id="342">But locals say that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began to shoot the crowd and killed one.</seg>
<seg id="343">"we were so in panic, we are afraid that it will give vengeance," "says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered, so the TIME."</seg>
<seg id="344">"I hid myself two days in my house."</seg>
<seg id="345">The Deiyai parliament has called to hold the officers involved and withdraw the mobile brigade from the police.</seg>
<seg id="346">Paniai was always a flashpoint for the Indonesian government.</seg>
<seg id="347">"the lack of meaningful development strengthens the discontent of the family members Mee, Moni, Dani and damal, which live in the green highlands of Papua."</seg>
<seg id="348">"many joined the" Free Papua movement "(OPM), the rebel army, claiming to defend the rights of the Papua people by shooting sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers."</seg>
<seg id="349">"some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai, among them Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yuden Kogoya."</seg>
<seg id="350">"in response to this, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily taken into custody under the pretext of" safeguarding national sovereignty. ""</seg>
<seg id="351">Some never appear again.</seg>
<seg id="352">"among the people in Papua, Paniai is known as" a tragic, forgotten place. ""</seg>
<seg id="353">Poverty strengthens dissatisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="354">The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.</seg>
<seg id="355">Bread is just as out of range.</seg>
<seg id="356">People here build everything they eat: especially nota and fruit and leafy vegetables.</seg>
<seg id="357">Agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potato.</seg>
<seg id="358">"they retain most of the harvest for the family, while the rest is sold on the local market."</seg>
<seg id="359">"ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 Cents)."</seg>
<seg id="360">"over the course of time, economic inequalities have grown among the native Papua and the new migrants, who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to the Nabire airport."</seg>
<seg id="361">The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and wealthier migrants.</seg>
<seg id="362">"occasionally, Papua have the capital or the necessary skills to make their own companies competitive."</seg>
<seg id="363">"the young people are not interested in staying in the village... for there are no jobs or money," says John Gobai, the chairman of the tribe of Paniai. "</seg>
<seg id="364">Isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua.</seg>
<seg id="365">"in addition, restrictions on reporting international media remain tense."</seg>
<seg id="366">"at the beginning of the year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua New Zealand because of lack of coordination with related institutions."</seg>
<seg id="367">"according to Phelim Kine, the Assistant Asia Director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokowis election campaign to raise the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized."</seg>
<seg id="368">"there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia's troubled provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa denial and a black list," "he said in an explanation."</seg>
<seg id="369">Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Papuas.</seg>
<seg id="370">"in March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called for the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the" various and widespread violations "in Papua, including the Paniai shooting."</seg>
<seg id="371">The same countries have historically supported the OPM.</seg>
<seg id="372">"the spokesman of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the allegations of the group and said journalists in Jakarta:" "there is still a democratic system in Indonesia, and there is free media so that it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases."</seg>
<seg id="373">People on the ground want more foreign governments to take note of this.</seg>
<seg id="374">"as an official delegation from the Netherlands, attended by the Human Rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, Jayapura on May 4, natives broke their silence and urged him" We want freedom, "according to a source that would also participate in the meeting but remain anonymous."</seg>
<seg id="375">"Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papua states that they probably won't vote again for Jokowi."</seg>
<seg id="376">"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shots," says Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council. "</seg>
<seg id="377">"he wants that Jokowi knows that the Paniai people, apart from that it lives under the constant threat of a predatory military, is located in poor education and health services."</seg>
<seg id="378">"Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papua, consider their voice for Jokowi as a" guilt "that he has to pay back."</seg>
<seg id="379">"they don't need money, they just want justice," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="380">"despite threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai victims led a final symbolic act of defiance: the corpse of an victim was buried in an area just opposite the police and the military station."</seg>
<seg id="381">"they know that perhaps justice will never come to them, but at least they will not forget their crimes."</seg>
<seg id="382">"one member of our family was killed," says Yacobus with a lowered head. "</seg>

<seg id="411">The most common items that were intentionally passed by TSA agents were food and fluids.</seg>
<seg id="412">"more than 3 percent admitted to have knowingly borne objects with blades through security control, while 2.2 percent of the female respondents and 3.7 percent of the male respondents confirmed that they intentionally brought illegal drugs to the aircraft."</seg>

<seg id="421">"electric-Tausendsassa Elon Musk enjoys the huge number of orders for his new Tesla" "Model 3". ""</seg>
<seg id="422">"so far, he has assumed that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation."</seg>
<seg id="423">"in addition to the ever triumphaled figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla-CEO Elon Musk has for the first time revealed a different, less brilliant figure at the announcement of the recent quarter of the quarterly report: the cancellation of the new mass market model 3."</seg>
<seg id="424">"in recent months, Musk has frequently recruited more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose extradition has just begun."</seg>
<seg id="425">"now Musk is dreaming: of the 518,000 pre-orders in total, 63,000 had already been withdrawn."</seg>
<seg id="426">Critics repeatedly pointed out that it was merely non-binding reservations.</seg>
<seg id="427">"in case of cancellation, Tesla pays the 1000 Euro (in the US $1000 and in the UK 1000 pounds)" "reservation payment" "completely."</seg>
<seg id="428">"currently 45,000 of such non-binding reservations stipulate that Musk is in a telephone conference with analysts."</seg>
<seg id="429">"however, the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of so far about twelve percent of all orders could be a problem."</seg>
<seg id="430">"his argument: the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not in demand, but on the production side."</seg>
<seg id="431">"last year Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles."</seg>
<seg id="432">"in 2018, all models are to be taken together - 500,000 by 2020 one million."</seg>
<seg id="433">The demand for this is obvious.</seg>
<seg id="434">"according to Musk, a total of 1800 bookings are made per day."</seg>
<seg id="435">"who orders a" "Model 3" "today should expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive his brand-new, never in practice tested production lines with maximum capacity utilization."</seg>
<seg id="436">Many experts doubt that this is possible.</seg>

<seg id="439">EPA boss Pruitt goes back to the reduction of emissions due to the execution of the Obama-Era rules</seg>
<seg id="440">"one day after he had been sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Authority, withdrew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce emissions of smog-causing pollutants."</seg>
<seg id="441">Pruitt presented the change when his agency turned out to be responsive to the needs of state environmental agencies compared to previous administrations.</seg>
<seg id="442">He did not mention the lawsuit which had been raised against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appeal.</seg>
<seg id="443">It is about a period that was going on on 1 October for states to comply with the standards of 2015 for down-to-earth ozone.</seg>
<seg id="444">"in June, Pruitt declared that he would delay the observance of a year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid" interfering with local decisions or hindering economic growth. ""</seg>
<seg id="445">"Pruitt, who was prosecutor of Oklahoma prior to his appointment, was a reliable opponent of strict environmental regulations for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="446">"since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly passed over to blocking or delaying regulation, which resists the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels."</seg>
<seg id="447">The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal back for the Pruitts regulatory rollback agenda.</seg>
<seg id="448">"last month, a Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the EPA Administrator obliges his authority to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration, the oil and gas companies committed to monitor and reduce methane leakage."</seg>
<seg id="449">"in a statement published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that his reversal in ozone standards is simply the willingness of EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfilling the new standards."</seg>
<seg id="450">"under previous administrations, the EPA has often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then wait to be charged by activists and others, and in an agreement to set the date for implementation," "said Pruitt, who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job."</seg>

<seg id="466">"750 years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche, the old cemetery site in Tumbling will be invited to a Serenade on Sunday, 16 July at 4.30 pm."</seg>
<seg id="467">"whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historical St. Hilarius plant is a popular place to stay."</seg>
<seg id="468">The visitors of the sixth benefit Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and promoters Tumlingens their concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini emphasizes: "it is a unique village gem.</seg>
<seg id="471">"in 1267, the Chapel of St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the Württembergische primitive customer book:" "Graf Hermann von Sulz sold" "the mountain with the" "Vogtei" "at Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver."</seg>
<seg id="472">"according to the wording of the certificate, on the Hill of Tumble, apart from the former parish church, there was also a magnificent court where the church or the patronage belonged, and not the other way round."</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">"as from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt from 1858, it was beside the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the town picture of Tumble, the" Mountain "the third, the most beautiful settlers of the village."</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps from the time around the year 1600 will underpin these historical circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage arose from the early medieval self-church law.</seg>
<seg id="477">"a master who built a church, refunded and occupied with a priest, remained the owner of this church and could also bequeathed this church."</seg>
<seg id="478">This was the right to use a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The bigger of the two barred at Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">"the newly acquired bell rang for the first time in 1692, but had to be delivered later in the Second World War in 1942."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the Thirty Years' War (1616-1648), the windows were cut and the bell parts were stolen."</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops camped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church were threatened in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the Tumour Hilarius cemetery was also the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was enlarged and the church of Hilariuskirche was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was left standing.</seg>
<seg id="490">"in the New Year's night in 1834, a storm split the church tower and half crashed."</seg>
<seg id="491">"to prevent misfortune, the tower was stopped."</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower-tower existing today was preserved as a witness of the 750 year-old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">"today, Horst Kallberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem maintain the Hilarius plant as the successor of Dieter Dockhorn as the successor of Dieter Dockhorn."</seg>
<seg id="494">"the organizers invite the friends and promoters of Tumlinnen on Sunday 16th July, to the sixth Serenade on the old cemetery to the St. Hilariuskapelle."</seg>
<seg id="495">This is designed by the Combo of the Kepler High School Freudenstadt and with essays by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">Local leader Hartmut Romann speaks the closing word.</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 16.30.</seg>

<seg id="505">"" "Boisheim defends itself" "does not see a legal requirement for the construction and therefore has turned to the councillor."</seg>
<seg id="506">Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) called on the association "Boisheim" to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim region.</seg>
<seg id="507">It is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="508">"the association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheim Nette no wind turbines could have been approved, since at the time in Viersen only a wind force concentration zone existed at the border to Schwalmtal."</seg>
<seg id="509">"within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city."</seg>
<seg id="510">Such zones shall prevent a "saving" of the landscape.</seg>
<seg id="511">"a few days earlier, the city of Viersen had approved a second wind force concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette by a change in the land use plan - but the district government of Düsseldorf did not approve, because of a lack of form."</seg>
<seg id="512">"due to the lack of planning permission, the approved approval requirement is still unlawful and therefore also reversed," "said Christoph Erkens, chairman of" Boisheim. ""</seg>
<seg id="513">"current state of affairs: before the summer break, the city council once again decided to leave the wind concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette; a permit from the district government is still pending."</seg>
<seg id="514">"Erkens:" "thus, the issuance of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is legally excluded."</seg>
<seg id="515">The circle confirms the receipt of the request.</seg>
<seg id="516">"the corresponding writing has been entered in the circle of Viersen since last week," "explained a spokesman."</seg>
<seg id="517">The circle takes her to the occasion to re-examine the matter again.</seg>
<seg id="518">"however, they are not likely to cause the procedure to be stopped."</seg>
<seg id="519">"with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the circle on Thursday did not want to comment on the argumentation of the association" Boisheim. ""</seg>
<seg id="520">"the NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, plans to build four each 200 metres high wind turbines on an area at the Boisheim niche."</seg>
<seg id="521">"last year, the company, where the town of Viersen is indirectly involved, closed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65-acre site."</seg>
<seg id="522">"with the establishment of the four wind turbines, the electricity requirement of around 11 400 households is to be covered - this corresponds to about a fifth of the electricity needs of all four-grown households."</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">"last summer, Viersen Stadstepped gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich Windpark near Aachen, as well as a stake in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in the Kreis Heinsberg region."</seg>

<seg id="583">"it is really incredible that no single person was arrested in all these years - even though we see them in our congregations, although we know who they are," "said Tyrone Brooks, who helps with the organisation of the postures."</seg>
<seg id="584">"it is a dirt spot on a story, but it is a burden for our souls."</seg>
<seg id="585">Brooks is a 71-year-old former Congress of the State of Georgia and a life-long civil rights lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="586">"for him, readjustment serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Monroe community that injustice has never been corrected."</seg>

<seg id="601">Brooks formulates it even more concise.</seg>
<seg id="602">"it was an electoral massacre," "he said."</seg>

<seg id="608">But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have done through.</seg>

<seg id="612">"I feel dirty because I'm not so," "said Marbaugh."</seg>
<seg id="613">"but I think it's very important to keep this story alive, because we don't want to return to those times."</seg>
<seg id="614">"on the other side of the room actor Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, rehearsed their lines."</seg>

<seg id="643">"children hock on their heads, record the fake blood and the silent bodies and whisper each other."</seg>

<seg id="867">Hoffmann is convinced that his team will get better after the experience in the preparation with the triple-chain than with the four-box.</seg>
<seg id="868">"I don't know how we will act in Aue," says his trainer Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his cause, "because we have just in the three-dimensional chain at the semi-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießmann players who can build well," Hoffmann said. "</seg>
<seg id="869">"the prerequisite is, however, that we harmonise even better and we don't have so many playing mistakes in the construction."</seg>

<seg id="877">"but they do not know as 100 per cent where they are currently standing," says the Interior Defender of Fortuna. "</seg>
<seg id="878">"admittedly, the guests from the Rhineland play as a light favorite on Sunday in the meeting at last (almost) finished stadium of Aue."</seg>
<seg id="879">"that we sweep them off just because we have the right to come under the first six is stupid," says Funkel, whose balance is quite positive with only one defeat against an eye out of nine games. "</seg>

<seg id="997">"I thought it was a very open answer, a very honest presentation today," "said IAAF President Coe to the reporter."</seg>
<seg id="998">"the whole Council and the whole Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has recognized by itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times, and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is redesigned."</seg>
<seg id="999">CoE said he was also "delighted" that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.</seg>
<seg id="1000">"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think progress was made, but the Congress endorses the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to re-use Russia," Coe said. "</seg>

<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unimpeded issues of European football clubs will not disrupt Neymars world record transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"any consequences will come to Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, as the guiding organization that oversees the European game has the power to prohibit teams from entering the prestigious Champions League tournament."</seg>
<seg id="1124">"financial Fair Play rules, launched in 2011 by UEFA, mean that PSG has to prove at some point that Neymar's transfer has been financed without major losses."</seg>
<seg id="1125">"Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million $) to get the Brazilians out of their contract, and Neymar will receive a salary which will amount to tens of tens of millions of dollars a year."</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">"PSG can safely make the money loose, so that Neymar writes and put it into a galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team by the energy rich royal family of Qatar."</seg>
<seg id="1128">"clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the purchase of players, but have to counteract with legitimate income sources that allow them the break-even point in their football-related business."</seg>
<seg id="1129">"FFP was designed by Michel Platini, after his election to the UEFA presidency in 2007."</seg>
<seg id="1130">"the former French player believed that clubs, who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success, effectively cheat and risked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support."</seg>
<seg id="1131">"in 2011, FFP shifted from concentration to the debt of the clubs to monitor their losses."</seg>
<seg id="1132">"the change meant that the business model, the Roman Abramovich originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then powerfully invested in order to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a tougher issue."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"during the current three-year FFP publishing period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of 30 million euros."</seg>
<seg id="1134">"and although Platini has fallen from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor, Aleksander Ceferin, will continue to scare away from excessive expenditure."</seg>

<seg id="1136">"although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount for billing over the duration of its contract."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"for the next five years, Neymar has signed a five-year contract, which can be accounted for by 44.4 million euros in the financial statements for the next five years."</seg>

<seg id="1140">UEFA is looking for clubs that might try to beat out their financial supervision by inflating their revenues by companies associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">"while a catfish company could sponsor the PSG, if the value of sponsorship should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not be regarded as legitimate income."</seg>

<seg id="1185">"as a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and embodiment of our Facebook-capable era of permanent memories."</seg>

<seg id="1231">"according to the Register, ten million people with foreign nationality are recorded in the register, including about 5.7 million from non-EU states."</seg>
<seg id="1232">The data is therefore managed by approximately 600 foreign-country authorities in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1233">"because the data had not been sufficiently maintained, the data quality in parts has not been good until now."</seg>
<seg id="1234">"in individual cases, data from 1921 have been found," by people who are no longer alive, or by citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer show up in the register. "</seg>
<seg id="1235">"incorrect data entries can slow reverse processes considerably," "says the report."</seg>
<seg id="1236">"in the statistics of paid people, EU citizens are also included who would not have to leave."</seg>

<seg id="1262">The Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25%</seg>
<seg id="1263">The Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weakening of inflation dampened speculation over a rise.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "sluggish" when it retained the interest rates on family income in the midst of boosting pressure.</seg>
<seg id="1265">"the political decision-makers of the Monetary Committee (MPC) of the Bank voted for 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.25%, with fewer members to increase in this month because weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase."</seg>
<seg id="1266">"in its quarterly inflation forecast, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and to 1.6% for 2018 and warned that the pressure on domestic income would continue, with inflation expected to rise to just under 3% in the fall."</seg>
<seg id="1267">But it signalized that in the next few years interest increases would be necessary to bridle the inflation heated by Brexit and she said that the borrowing costs may have to rise more than expected on the financial markets.</seg>
<seg id="1268">"the members also agreed to withdraw part of the Mammoth economic stimulus package, which was published one year after the Brexit."</seg>
<seg id="1269">"it will demand time for the financial plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks from next February, although it is expected that it will now provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling."</seg>
<seg id="1270">"after the decision on the interest rate, the Bank said:" in the central forecast of the MPC, GDP will remain weak at short notice, as pressure on the real income of households continues to burden consumption. "</seg>
<seg id="1271">"on the interest rates, it repeated that" a certain tightening of monetary policy "would be necessary to cool inflation and a" slightly larger "scale than the markets expect."</seg>
<seg id="1272">The markets currently forecast the first rise in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="1273">"however, the Bank emphasized that elevations would be" "gradual" "and" "limited". ""</seg>
<seg id="1274">The Bank's growth forecasts for this and next year are projected to rise by 1.9% and 1.7% compared with the forecast in May.</seg>
<seg id="1275">It has retained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1276">"according to these news, Pound fell to the dollar and the euro."</seg>
<seg id="1277">"the pound dropped by 0,5% to 1.31 US dollars and fell by 0.4% to 1.11 euros."</seg>
<seg id="1278">"the decision to no change comes after the recent disappointing growth figures have damped rising expectations on interest rates, and GDP in the second quarter of 0.2% has risen to 0.3% in the previous three months."</seg>
<seg id="1279">"growth in the third quarter is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will recover slightly after the Bank at the end of the year."</seg>
<seg id="1280">"the latest inflation forecast offered little enthusiasm for households who are affected by increasing inflation and minor salary increases, as the tightening is still worse before it gets better."</seg>
<seg id="1281">"she added that monetary policy in the coming years cannot" "prevent income departure," "but she added that the wages at the end of their three-year forecast are" "clear". ""</seg>
<seg id="1282">"the economy is also strengthened by the rising demand for British goods, which is attributable to the weak Pound, which will compensate for a portion of lower consumption expenditure."</seg>
<seg id="1283">The decision comes one year after lowering interest rates to 0.25% last August following the shocking EU vote that caused the sinking of the funnel.</seg>
<seg id="1284">The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years to fully achieve the prices and the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1285">"before the Bank's last judgment on interest rates, the call for interest rates has risen since inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three political decision-makers in July demanding an increase to 0.5%."</seg>
<seg id="1286">"inflation has dropped from 2.9% in June to 2.6% in June, although the Bank said it was expected to attract them again in the coming months."</seg>
<seg id="1287">"the Bank said that the excess in relation to its target of 2% would be" "wholly" "to the weak Pound."</seg>
<seg id="1288">"Andrew Montlains, director of Coreco Mortgage Broker, said:" given the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again, as the creditors are looking for businesses and want to end the year in a positive manner. "</seg>
<seg id="1289">"the market is particularly good for those in which the existing deals are running out and the new mortgages finish, and many with toll free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular."</seg>

<seg id="1292">"NHS England announced that a pre-exposure prophylaxis received before sexual intercourse (prep), which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by some 86 percent, is now delivered by the health service through a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"he agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appeal confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court last year, according to which the NHS had the authority to pay for the prep despite the claim that local authorities should finance it."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"the chess train announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England head Simon Stevens as" "important new intervention", "while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) described this as a" decisive moment. ""</seg>
<seg id="1295">"sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to enable registration of people, and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced to all over England in April 2018."</seg>
<seg id="1296">Preexposure prophylaxis (prep) is a result of HIV drugs taken before sex in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Studies have shown that prep significantly reduces the HIV transmission in infection risk.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Taking prep before sexual intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Such medications can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse.</seg>
<seg id="1300">"those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated."</seg>
<seg id="1301">"in hospitals suitable participants will be identified, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment."</seg>
<seg id="1302">People living in England and registered with a GP may also register for a possible participation at their local participating sex clinic.</seg>
<seg id="1303">The program will sign up £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to deliver the medicines this week after an international sourcing.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"the study aims to assess the full potential of prep by collecting clinical evidence, how it is used, recorded and implemented on a large scale."</seg>
<seg id="1305">"Stevens said:" "this great new intervention should supplement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV."</seg>
<seg id="1306">It is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in coping with one of humanity's biggest health challenges. "</seg>
<seg id="1307">"Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National AIDS Trust), said:" "this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV."</seg>
<seg id="1308">"prep, if targeted towards needy and endangered people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic."</seg>
<seg id="1309">"from September onwards, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded experiment in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives."</seg>
<seg id="1310">We warmly welcome this announcement. "</seg>
<seg id="1311">"Ian Green, Chairman of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said:" "the priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind."</seg>
<seg id="1312">"now that prep test medicine has been obtained, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 infected people."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"Sharon Hodgson, Minister of Defense, said:" "the start of the prep process is welcomed and overdue after months of delay and hesitation by the government."</seg>
<seg id="1314">The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.</seg>
<seg id="1315">This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of prep.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living the Great Life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks turned this little Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, moved from a large house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court apartment in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it's a proof of the new design that Joanne didn't pack her bags and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger room," Joanne says. "</seg>
<seg id="1321">I looked for something comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">I fell in love with them and made an offer on that day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely refurbished."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-bedroom property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and an mezzanine to optimally use the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, plenty of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"that was my request," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1328">"for this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use 12.5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms over one another, so that the architectural challenge consisted in creating an mezzanine where you could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel works are quite complicated," he explains. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other, without having to bend."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not just about building a simple platform, but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below."</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">"for the mezzanine, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and Vintage serge mouille lighting set the style for the program."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"at both ends, a short corridor is mirrored in order to let it work longer."</seg>
<seg id="1339">"in the kitchen, the mirroring feels like a window into another room."</seg>
<seg id="1340">"at the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all the cutlery and jars of Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1341">"through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering art went inside," explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door. "</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is counter-important, so that when you slide the door, it is very easy to glide."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is appreciated," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the floor size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"here, they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things you touch and therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you don't fall into the electrical outlets in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">"these are important, but they do not play with your heart."</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself by good design and increased square footage of slightly standard in something quite amazing.</seg>

<seg id="1356">"two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in an argument about one of the largest real estate imperialist Victorias worth over $500 million."</seg>
<seg id="1357">"the former director of Carlton Football Club 'and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors from his younger brother Paul."</seg>
<seg id="1358">"Paul wanted to retire from family business since 2014, but a sharp debate on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court."</seg>
<seg id="1359">"together with her mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the 1973 family bought a shop at Smith Street, Collingwood."</seg>
<seg id="1360">"there, the Westco family founded jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores."</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for $85 million in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">"this money was invested in real estate, and De Lutis's portfolio now includes offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as malls in the suburbs."</seg>
<seg id="1363">"following an agreement with her late father, Colin was described by Paul as" "main operator and the dominant personality" "in the family De Lutis - about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third."</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court record states that Colin owns property worth $316 million and Paul worth $176 million.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"the detachments proposed by Colin have left him with what I considered the best objects," he wrote in 2015 in a first affidavit. "</seg>
<seg id="1367">"last Friday, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place after several failed attempts."</seg>
<seg id="1368">"the Brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business, of which Colin, as Paul claims, have ruled him out."</seg>
<seg id="1369">"Colin argues that this is not true, but throws Paul forward to manage some possessions incompetent."</seg>
<seg id="1370">"in an early Affidavit, which was filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute."</seg>
<seg id="1371">"my Italian inheritance dictates that the family is the most important priority," "he wrote."</seg>
<seg id="1372">"the costs increase in the event, with hundreds of pages with affidavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and from both sides held law firms."</seg>
<seg id="1373">"Mrs. De Lutis and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran dairy-bars and delicatessen deals from the late 1950s, and in the early seventies bought a shop in Brunswick."</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the family's first jeans shop.</seg>
<seg id="1375">"Colin says he started" "Westco" "when he was" "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="1376">"Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their property to their sons."</seg>
<seg id="1377">"Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," "she wrote."</seg>
<seg id="1378">"two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis Group, where Colin claims that Mark was paid $10 million in leaving the company and Luke 26 million."</seg>
<seg id="1379">"both Luke and Mark were," Paul says about the conditions of their financial separation. "</seg>

<seg id="1382">"only Colin answered by SMS, to say" "I really can't say much," "because the case is before the courts."</seg>
<seg id="1383">"it is very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and draw our surname through the courts," he wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1384">"in mid-2016, Colin wrote in writing to the court that he tried to meet his brother's demands."</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trumps new Chief of Staff plans to restrict the media abstinence of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">"if so, he will be the first."</seg>
<seg id="1392">"Politico reports that the White House Chief of Staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump, including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more discounted rate."</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the White House's new Chief of Staff, met with senior employees on his first working day, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trumps's White House that he wanted to repair: poor information falling into the president's hands."</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would obtain good information.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring its media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">"President Trumps's relationship with television goes back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"if candidate Trump was annoyed because of unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of jobs that were convincing," said the former election adviser Sam Nunberg in February against Politico. "</seg>
<seg id="1399">"Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" "the key to keeping Trumps Twitter habit under control, according to six ex-election officials, insists that his personal media consumption includes a steady lobbying price."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps Twitter habit was ever under control is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don't know - that Trumps tweets would have contained even more fuel without their intervention.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about tweets that Trump hasn't sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">"if his collaborators have already managed to keep annoyance from him several times, their efforts have paid off."</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has to consistently prevent Trump's controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">"part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that potentially fosters their views from the world."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"Politico - very concerned with this history - reported in May about the advisers' preference, to give the president doubtful information to the president for strategic reasons."</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former trump officials say that Trump can react to negative press cuts like a volcano, especially those with leaky cheques, and that he insists on finding out where they come from."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"this was exactly what happened at the end of February, when someone maliciously announced a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provokateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh to be" the source behind a heap of leaks "in the White House."</seg>
<seg id="1411">"although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter for chicanes, or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has expressed false accusations in the past and revoked them."</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump was reading the article and started asking employees about Walsh.</seg>
<seg id="1413">"Goldsmith added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter, tried to implement a system in order to manage and document the paperwork that Trump received."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly attempts three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">"perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers are still striving for influence."</seg>
<seg id="1417">These immutable factors make Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1444">"from Birkenhof, Waldhotel Luise becomes"</seg>
<seg id="1445">The Waldhotel Luise becomes the former Hotel Birkenhof.</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">"because with the closing of the Hotel Birkenhof due to the then Ambiente operating company mbH on 13 April 2014, some 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and also income through the tourist tax."</seg>
<seg id="1449">"in the fall of 2014, in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who came to the district, the hotel building was offered as a collective shelter for controversial discussions."</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the placing of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed at that time in the municipal council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But especially Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald was defending the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties in the house.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group Luisenhotels with managing director Birgit Scherer based in Bad Bergzabern has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a home of the three-star Plus Category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.</seg>
<seg id="1457">"hot Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise."</seg>
<seg id="1458">"at the former Hotel Birkenhof, construction shuttles have been standing in front of the entrance for quite some time, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear what extensive renovations are made."</seg>
<seg id="1459">"the floors were torn out, ceilings partly broken down, old bathtubs removed from the rooms."</seg>
<seg id="1460">The entire hotel building is a single construction site.</seg>
<seg id="1461">"until March, there is still much to do."</seg>
<seg id="1462">"it is actually a nice place," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper. "</seg>
<seg id="1463">Everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style.</seg>
<seg id="1464">"the rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are built-in."</seg>
<seg id="1465">"everything should later become" "beautifully bourgeois", "as Thomas Scherer expresses."</seg>
<seg id="1466">"we want to make a piece of jewellery."</seg>
<seg id="1467">"swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room are part of the equipment."</seg>
<seg id="1468">"one does not want to be positioned at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already on an upscale inner city level, Scherer emphasized."</seg>
<seg id="1469">"the Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to be broadly set up, explains Scherer."</seg>
<seg id="1470">"individual vacationers, groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel."</seg>
<seg id="1471">"he has already led talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause, so Scherer."</seg>
<seg id="1472">The city's performances are identical to those of the hotel group.</seg>
<seg id="1473">"we are on the same line."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"after the amount of investment required, Thomas Scherer doesn't want to define exactly what he wants."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"just under one million euros, he calculates."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"the external systems are also brought to the front-man, which is already clearly visible."</seg>
<seg id="1477">"in a courtyard there is a large terrace, which will be accessible from the restaurant which is open to public."</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia-Affair: us Special Investigator sets up Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">"in the Russia affair for US President Donald Trump, special investigators Robert Mueller should have appointed a so-called Grand Jury after a report."</seg>
<seg id="1481">"in recent weeks, the committee has taken up the work, wrote the" Wall Street Journal "on appeal to people entrusted with the matter."</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper evaluated the step as a sign that Mueller extended and intensified his investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The channel CNN reported that there were already first invitations to the Gremiums in connection with a meeting between Trumps oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. secret services accused the Kremlin for a long time interfering in the 2016 presidential campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller investigates whether there were agreements between Trumps election campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"in the focus of the investigations, several men shall stand who acted as advisers to the Republicans in the election campaign."</seg>
<seg id="1487">"according to reports, Mueller took a close look at more and more Trumps in a private and business environment."</seg>
<seg id="1488">"the" Washington Post, "a few weeks ago, wrote that the special agent Trump has personally moved to the centre and investigates whether the President may have hindered the judiciary in the wake of the affair."</seg>
<seg id="1489">Grand Jury's main task is to examine the present evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether prosecution should be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jurassays are therefore also called accusations.</seg>
<seg id="1491">"most of the time, they are turned on when dealing with larger and controversial cases."</seg>
<seg id="1492">The process always takes place behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The Board can also be turned on by the public prosecutor to charge persons under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"according to the CNN channel, invitations have already been issued which revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"people who participated in the meeting were called on to a statement, it was said in the report."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"in addition, they should provide documents."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"in addition to Trump Jr. was also Trumps Advisor and son-in-law Jared Kushner, as well as his great election chief Paul Manafort."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"legal experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the introduction show that Mueller would not let himself be intimidated in his work, and that if necessary, he would act quickly."</seg>
<seg id="1499">"however, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the collection of an indictment."</seg>
<seg id="1500">"however, the introduction of the Gremium is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1501">"in the midst of the new revelations, on Thursday evening, the president used a speech in West Virginia to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of its political opponents."</seg>
<seg id="1502">"Russia's history is a total invention," "said Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1503">"the subject will give the democrats a chance to" feel good, "because they don't have anything else they can talk about."</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special adviser Ty Cobb stated in a statement that he did not know anything about the setting up of a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"but he also usually works in secret, he stressed."</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House endorses all measures that hastened the work of the Special Intermediator in a "fair" way.</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI chief James Comey said three times that not against the president.</seg>
<seg id="1508">"one has no reason to assume that something has changed, it was said in the explanation."</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller was only used after Trump Comey had fired Comey.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"because of this ramputation, accusations against Trump have become loud, he did not want to hinder the judiciary."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"in June, Comey, in front of a Senate committee, asked for a setting of investigations against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn."</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"after the presentation of US media, the White House collected material against the special agent and its staff."</seg>
<seg id="1514">This triggered speculations on whether Trump Mueller wanted to release Mueller.</seg>
<seg id="1515">"unlike an independent special agent of the Congress, such as the Watergate affair, for the later President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be recruited by the President of the Ministry of Justice."</seg>
<seg id="1516">Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"two groups of republican and democratic senators presented legislation on Thursday, after which the special agent could no longer be dismissed."</seg>
<seg id="1518">Antarctica: gigantic iceberg drives in Antarctica</seg>
<seg id="1519">"in the Western Antarctic, a gigantic iceberg has been replaced by the scarcely seven-fold size of Berlin by the Schelfeis."</seg>
<seg id="1520">This shared the Bremerhavener Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"the Koloss, which weighs more than one trillion and 5800 square kilometres, is now driving north and will probably need two, three years until it melted."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the biggest ice giants that researchers have registered in the past three decades."</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger for people from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">"as far as climate change has played a role in the decline of the iceberg, research data is unclear."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"in total, however, there have been a series of unusual breakthroughs in the region for about 30 years, writes the US research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a factual background."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"according to many researchers, this can be related to global warming."</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken colossus has been part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis so far.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow into the sea and regularly erupts.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the head of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">"to the north of this closing ceremony, the balance of waxing and breaking was disturbed several years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1532">AWI researcher Daniela Jansen writes a complete schelmeal there.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some argue that the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is in danger, because the front edge has never been as far back as it is currently."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"in addition, the ice sheet stands under tension and can collapse, if a piece is broken down at a key point."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg does not increase sea level as they float on the water and pushes ice as much water as it results after melting.</seg>
<seg id="1536">"however, the loss of the shellac causes the glaciers to flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"this could possibly increase sea level, but only to a small extent, writes the British research project on the observation of Antarctica (Midas)."</seg>
<seg id="1538">"according to AWI data with nearly 50 000 square kilometres, the Larsen-C Schelfeis is the fourth largest Schelfeis of the Antarctic."</seg>
<seg id="1539">"at the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters."</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks down on a regular basis.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural occurrence and no direct connection to climate change is aware, the ice shield now comes to a more dangerous position," "said Martin O'Leary of British Swansea University."</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the longest retreat since the beginning of records," he also confirmed. "</seg>
<seg id="1543">"scientists argued that the Larsen-C Schelfeis would now grow back or go back in the long term and possibly collapse, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added:" "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"even if these scientists do not repel the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, in the past decades many ice blocks of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen apart."</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirt of the Antarctic stretches towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">"according to data from the research program British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s."</seg>
<seg id="1548">The decline in temperature contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">"the Antarctic Peninsula has been heated by about three degrees in the last 50 years, making it one of the areas in which the temperature rises the fastest."</seg>

<seg id="1581">"if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue working," said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa. "</seg>
<seg id="1582">"Minnitis warning came one day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German Relief Organisation" "Youth Rettet" "because their crew worked effectively with traffickers in a manner that facilitated illegal immigration."</seg>
<seg id="1583">"the relief organisation, which has only been in operation for one year, refused to comment on the Italian prosecutor's Ambrogio Cartosio."</seg>
<seg id="1584">"we are sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," "said the organization in a statement on social media."</seg>
<seg id="1585">We can only judge any accusations that are currently being raised after we have collected all the information and can judge the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1586">"the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of 'Jugend Rettet', the Iuventa, since October."</seg>
<seg id="1587">"it is assumed that its crew is taking dinghy migrants aboard, which are delivered to them directly by traffickers, and that the smugglers can abort so that the ships can be used again."</seg>
<seg id="1588">"at least one such meeting was allegedly held only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the Act of the Prosecutor, whose content was published by Italian media."</seg>
<seg id="1589">"the occupation is suspected of overthrowing the authority of the Italian Coastguard, the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives."</seg>
<seg id="1590">"under the code of conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities."</seg>
<seg id="1591">"only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue missions have so far agreed to keep the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain."</seg>
<seg id="1592">"the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable as they would not bring any" significant changes or obstructions "to their rescue operations."</seg>
<seg id="1593">Among those who refuse to sign is Nobel laureate organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).</seg>
<seg id="1594">"Minniti said meanwhile that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures in Italy has declined sharply in recent weeks, indicating that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguards and the cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit."</seg>
<seg id="1595">"in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the minister. "</seg>
<seg id="1596">"there were plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe."</seg>
<seg id="1597">Ascents and Trials</seg>
<seg id="1598">"nine Weilermer Bikers, the" Berliner outpost "and two guest drivers met at Wachenheim in the northern pfalz for four days to enjoy Trials and Sights."</seg>
<seg id="1599">"for this, three friendly guides were available."</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The Burgundy and Weinfest from Wachenheim was a welcome extra.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour led to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim during hot summer temperatures.</seg>
<seg id="1603">"viewpoints followed, partly on towers, from which one could look far beyond the Palatinate Forest and the upstream planes."</seg>
<seg id="1604">In between there were always longer ascents for the long trials.</seg>
<seg id="1605">On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and to the folk festival Wurstmarkt.</seg>
<seg id="1606">"again, there was a lookout spot connected by" "floated" "trials and moderate ascents."</seg>
<seg id="1607">"on the last two days, many altitude meters were announced."</seg>
<seg id="1608">"caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and refuges brought welcome breaks."</seg>
<seg id="1609">In Bad Dürkheim the bikers inhaled brine in the open air inhalatorium.</seg>
<seg id="1610">Neustadt was also controlled.</seg>
<seg id="1611">"after 173 kilometres and almost 4500 metres altitude, the group met the Pfälzer Wald from its best side - sporty and culturally."</seg>
<seg id="1612">Console instead of grass - Bundesliga equips itself for e-sports</seg>
<seg id="1613">Are the sports stars in the future sitting in front of computer consoles instead of being sweaty by wind and weather over the stadium racing?</seg>
<seg id="1614">"fact: e-sport has long become a serious business, a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gauges included."</seg>
<seg id="1615">These have also recognised the first federal ligades that are increasingly involved in this field.</seg>
<seg id="1616">"the beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, followed by the FC Schalke 04 and last of the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sports department in mid-July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17."</seg>
<seg id="1617">"we hope to enthuse new young target groups for the VfB," says CEO Jochen Röttgermann. "</seg>
<seg id="1618">"he is sure," "that many clubs still climb on this train."</seg>
<seg id="1619">"next weekend, the FIFA World Cup organizes the first" "Interactive Club World Cup" "in London, where gamers of different clubs compete against each other."</seg>
<seg id="1620">"apart from Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Eindhoven qualified for example."</seg>
<seg id="1621">Robin Dutt also sees great potential in E-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1622">The Ex-Trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players.</seg>
<seg id="1623">"real football has to deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds, that young people will still go into the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old. "</seg>
<seg id="1624">"and: the clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets, especially the Asian ones."</seg>
<seg id="1625">"with prominent e-athletes under contract, one could be more often present on these markets online more often than once a year to send the Bundesliga to Asia."</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it all about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">"in E-Sport, computer games such as" League Of Legends, "" Dota 2, "" Counterstrike "or the football simulation FIFA are being challenged at competition level."</seg>
<seg id="1628">"as in normal sports, they have long established leagues in which the pros compete against each other."</seg>
<seg id="1629">"and by 2022, E-Sport is already part of the official programme."</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it really a kind of sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">"for many, the idea is certain to get used to."</seg>
<seg id="1632">Also Ingo Frobous has long dealt with the question.</seg>
<seg id="1633">"for the professor at the German Sports College in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical reactions that can be found in classical sport - for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes."</seg>
<seg id="1634">"in addition, it requires cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and rapid response."</seg>
<seg id="1635">Professional gamers should not only train on the console but also their bodies and pay attention to nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="1636">"the fit player is a good player."</seg>
<seg id="1637">"however, robatics also have problems:" doping is becoming more and more a topic. "</seg>
<seg id="1638">"checks should be difficult for online games, and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing."</seg>
<seg id="1639">The scientist highlights the high integrative effect of E-Sports.</seg>
<seg id="1640">"players are internationally on the move, that's like a big global family, there are no intercultural obstacles."</seg>
<seg id="1641">A study by the management consultancy Deloitte and the Bundesverband Interactive Entertainment software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in e-sports.</seg>
<seg id="1642">"in 2016 more than 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany, mainly via advertising, sponsoring and big tournaments."</seg>
<seg id="1643">Sales are expected to be 130 million in three years.</seg>
<seg id="1644">"against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the football Bundesliga, this is little."</seg>
<seg id="1645">"however, the e-sport is not far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," writes the Deloitte counsellors. "</seg>
<seg id="1646">Many countries have already passed internationally.</seg>
<seg id="1647">"great markets are Asia and the USA, where ex-basketball players Shaquille O'Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez participate in the US Team NRG eSports."</seg>
<seg id="1648">Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSport-betting provider Unikrn.</seg>
<seg id="1649">There is a lot going on in Europe as well.</seg>
<seg id="1650">"in a Norwegian school, e-sport has been introduced as a teaching subject, says Frobous."</seg>
<seg id="1651">"according to Dutt, the football league clubs in the Netherlands and France are now obliged to set up an e-sports department."</seg>
<seg id="1652">"in the European comparison, Germany is lagging behind," explains VfB Director Röttgermann. "</seg>
<seg id="1653">"only in nostalgia to decay, and to clarify the old days, is not enough today."</seg>
<seg id="1654">"the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association, but to align the company with the modern market at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1655">"we live in a digitized world," says Dutt. "</seg>

<seg id="1662">A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend by texts and calls to commit suicide.</seg>
<seg id="1663">"Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been exposed to probation."</seg>
<seg id="1664">Carter was convicted in June because of negligence by Conrad Roy on 13 July 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1665">The father of Roy spoke on Thursday at the hearing: "my family is not comforting.</seg>
<seg id="1666">My son was my best friend. "</seg>
<seg id="1667">Carter was allowed to stay free until his appeal.</seg>
<seg id="1668">"she had been confronted with a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy have suffered from a mental illness."</seg>
<seg id="1669">"dressed in red trousers and a cream-colored blouse, Carter stood with tears in her eyes, with folded hands and downward pointing eyes when she was convicted."</seg>
<seg id="1670">"their actions have killed Conrad Roy," "said the prosecutor to the court."</seg>
<seg id="1671">She finished his life to make her own better.</seg>
<seg id="1672">"she did not take any responsibility," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="1673">"she has not shown any remorse."</seg>
<seg id="1674">"but Carter's lawyer said it was a" "terrible circumstance which she deplores completely." ""</seg>
<seg id="1675">"judge Lawrence Moniz, however, said he did not figure out that their" age or maturity "or even their mental disease have a significant influence on their actions."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"a public prosecutor read a statement by Roys mother Lynn Roy, who said that there is" no day in which I do not steal the loss of my beloved Son. "</seg>
<seg id="1677">"I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything. I try to be there for his sisters, despite all my pains that we will carry for eternity."</seg>
<seg id="1678">"Roya's sister, Camdyn Roy, said she was" "persecuted by the knowledge" "that she would never take part in the wedding of her brother or be aunt for his children."</seg>
<seg id="1679">"no more this single person with whom I was together since my birth is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="1680">"the case seems to be a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts, which makes it a crime to commit another to commit suicide."</seg>
<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1682">"the case drew national attention, after Carter's text message revealed that she encouraged him to end his life."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"hang up, spring from a building, arise yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family. "</seg>
<seg id="1684">"in the moments before his suicide, she wrote:" you must do it, Conrad "and" Everything you have to do is turn off the generator, and you will be free and happy. "</seg>
<seg id="1685">Judge Moniz told Carter's attention through the death of Roy and ordered them to benefit from the fall by some press.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The case has the legal opinion shared.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"one of the few who defended the Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 for murder of her British roommate in Italy before she was acquitted two years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1688">"Ms. Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times:" Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison. "</seg>

<seg id="1690">"that Joshua was allowed to run at the Audi Cup as a captain, is no accident."</seg>
<seg id="1691">The FC Bayern tres a big season to the Confed-Cup winner - extra motivation does not hurt.</seg>

<seg id="1695">"well, the one could have run better than at 0: 2 versus the SSC Naples."</seg>
<seg id="1696">But the sign from the coach could also hint me this way.</seg>

<seg id="1699">"those who were chosen to take part in the legacy of Lame, can only use a little extra motivation."</seg>
<seg id="1700">"Kimi confirmed:" "that's what you want as a player: take responsibility."</seg>
<seg id="1701">"on Wednesday, the 22-year-old sat on the field as a mini-Lame."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"at the right rear, that is his position, the white bandage on the arm did the rest."</seg>
<seg id="1703">"and at all Kime worked in this initial formation like the one, who can take the helm at the very best."</seg>
<seg id="1704">"he gave instructions, tried to direct the infiltrated troupe."</seg>
<seg id="1705">"he had the view of the whole, while many others were busy with themselves."</seg>
<seg id="1706">"Vidal thereby to replay his lack of fitness (do not fold); Renato Sanches thus, on the devil, come out to the services of the Asia-journey (fold also only conditionally); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle with it, in their first appearance in Bavaria-Trikot not negatively fall off."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"after all, it worked quite well."</seg>
<seg id="1708">"Süle ran beside Kimi, Rudy in front of the defense, both acted sovereign."</seg>
<seg id="1709">"the well-known Napoli storm was often difficult, and Süle also tried a few times successfully in the game design."</seg>

<seg id="1726">"it was often irreconcilable, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still the Minister of Economics of Rhineland-Palatinate."</seg>
<seg id="1727">This shows after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wisser (FDP) is in office.</seg>
<seg id="1728">Chambers and companies from the region speak on T V demand of a change in economic policy - and simultaneously charge the old Minister.</seg>
<seg id="1729">"Frank natus, Chairman of the Association of Trierer Businesses (VTU), says:" "Wisser takes up the wishes of the economy, which Lemke has all blocked."</seg>
<seg id="1730">The largest turnaround is of course in infrastructure policy: the gap between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country's priority list.</seg>
<seg id="1731">"this year, the ministry hopes for a planning procedure until 2021 is to stand construction law."</seg>
<seg id="1732">"the West Bank also plays a role in the plans of the country, which is in the impenetrable need of the federal communication plan."</seg>
<seg id="1733">"the aim is to take the track in operation in December 2020, says Ministeriumsfeld Cornelia Holtmann."</seg>
<seg id="1734">"natus sees in it a sign for supporting regional, but internationally competitive enterprises."</seg>
<seg id="1735">"the Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Chamber of Commerce) Trier strives, as learned from Wisser, a Rhineland-Palatinate-Label, in order to increase sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of German wine exports that have been sagging for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="1736">"in addition, Wisser has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company, praise the Chamber of Industry."</seg>
<seg id="1737">"the Handwerkskammer Trier provides an additional incentive for young trainees in the new master bonus, says managing director Matthias Schwalbach."</seg>
<seg id="1738">A bonus of 1000 Euro for the passed master examination and 2500 Euros will be provided if graduates are able to become independent within ten years of the master's education.</seg>
<seg id="1739">But the homework list for the country remains long.</seg>
<seg id="1740">"the planned road construction is fast facts, and at the same time it is out of the country with the necessary personnel, says Jan Glockauer, head of the Chamber of Commerce of the Chamber of Commerce of Trier."</seg>
<seg id="1741">"up to now, 56 new engineers, who want to employ Wisser for mobility, have only been occupied in 29 places."</seg>
<seg id="1742">The Chamber of Commerce also calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices.</seg>
<seg id="1743">"commenting on the calculations of the Court of Auditors, CDU factional vice, Christian Baldauf, points out more than 20 million euros less than proposed in the preservation of country roads in 2017 and 2018."</seg>
<seg id="1744">"in addition, Frank natus also expects the country's concept to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region."</seg>
<seg id="1745">Intimidating is also the current broadband expansion in the country.</seg>

<seg id="1751">"one day before the announcement of Audi, BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles."</seg>
<seg id="1752">"the BMW Group said that the company believes that" "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions," "and thus referred to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - to ban or limit diesel vehicles."</seg>
<seg id="1753">Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1754">None of the companies described undertakings as a recall.</seg>
<seg id="1755">European automakers have greatly promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1756">"but nitrogen oxides, emitting diesel engines, are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma."</seg>
<seg id="1757">"the cost of car manufacturers to install exhaust fumes from diesel vehicles also increases, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive."</seg>
<seg id="1758">German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of indulging the powerful car companies and ignoring the signs of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1759">"companies try to avoid Volkswagen mistakes, using so-called off-off devices that could regulate emissions to comply with regulations when a car was tested, but driving back under normal driving conditions."</seg>
<seg id="1760">"in the United States, several Volkswagen employees were indicted, others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic."</seg>
<seg id="1761">"last month, the former head of Thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany."</seg>
<seg id="1762">"the former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be tried in the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1763">"at the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe, and a request that focused on the United States has been extended."</seg>
<seg id="1764">The involvement of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer bears disproportionately to Volkswagen's win.</seg>

<seg id="1781">"in the first years as an artist, he, among other things, suggested himself as a drawer for congratulation cards - which frustrated him."</seg>

<seg id="1796">"it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change."</seg>
<seg id="1797">"lavender is declining because of the conditions reminiscent of drought and because of the diseases transmitted insects, causing scientists and farmers trying to find solutions, great headaches."</seg>
<seg id="1798">"Eric Chaisse, expert of the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said:" "lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years, which in the spring brought much less rain and in autumn much more."</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">"there is also a small zikade, a micro bacterium that transmits dwarf cycads, and in very dry weather there are many of them."</seg>
<seg id="1801">And there is a lot in the game.</seg>
<seg id="1802">"lavender oil does not only lure for vacationers, it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics."</seg>

<seg id="1809">The murder of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">"the employees of the weekly Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars."</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children into the office, which were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room: opponents, Neutral, Allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"they ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and abdominal feelings reach."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the salary list of the government or the cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no respite of violence, and while the corpses are accumulating throughout the country, more and more journalists are here: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are facing attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there were at least seven deaths in seven countries this year."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter is her editor and her inspirer by Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1820">"his absence is felt deeply, although his presence is everywhere - a great photo of Valdez, which shows his middle finger with the word" Justice "hanging on the facade of the Feodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts, which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although a Federal Prosecutor's Office was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists, it has only initiated two criminal proceedings according to the committee for the protection of journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"like most of the thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year, journalists are rarely tried by journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"at Riodoce they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are impregnable and although the terrain is now more treacherous."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little use, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we don't know the reason, we mistrust all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"on the morning of 15 May, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in Culiacan capital."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times shot on him, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with" 12th river. ""</seg>
<seg id="1830">The Sagittarius drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a wife and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly around in Culiacan freely.</seg>
<seg id="1834">"but on Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence."</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzman's arrest in the last year and the delivery to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, as rival groups fight to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it doesn't matter that in Sinaloa one or more people are shot on the street every day or that the cemetery is full of ornamented, two-storey mausoleums for drug kingfishers, which are larger than many homes for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "peace" if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable harbours and drug trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">"nevertheless and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was broken with guilt that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"at first, in February the publication of an interview with Damascene Lopez, a leader of one of the rivaling cartel fractions in the war with Guzman's sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this release may have upset the sons, suspected gang members bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kiosks."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second mistake was to not force Valdez to leave the country for his own security, following the confiscation of another newspaper that had published the same story."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues for the founding of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa," it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the drug prohibition problem, "said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1847">"over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for the courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporters loved to publish hard-fitting examinations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories that no one else dared to treat."</seg>
<seg id="1849">"eight years after the founding of Feodoce, she received the prestigious" Maria Moors-Cabot Award "for her reporting in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history, wherever it led."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave himself up voluntarily that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I would like to continue living," "he said at the time of the CPJ."</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug trafficking in Sinaloa" is a way of life, "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV."</seg>
<seg id="1854">"you have to take over the task, which falls you as a journalist - either that or you play the dummy."</seg>
<seg id="1855">I don't want to be asked: "what have you done in the face of so many dead... why did you not say what was going on?"</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun bird, who was able to curse like a port worker, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">"now they ask," "Was his love for the routine be his ruin?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1861">"his death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how to do their job best, and stay alive."</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it when you deal with their women, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways and runways to move drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation."</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it smells untrue, stay away from it."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the trouble is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that" smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then the thing is happening with Javier. "</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"days before it became known that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">"outside, two policemen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree."</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a mid-size Culiacan area.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the joke, some of the reporters asked themselves whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen who proclaimed the governor himself as not trustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months since the reporters have gone to the mountain landscape, where drug gangs are de facto under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the edition of this week Riodoce has been waiting for three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former famous boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">"they also had an exposé to the state expenditures, which concentrated on the hometown of the governor."</seg>
<seg id="1878">"and there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor, conducting a kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who was kidnapped or as it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"a reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all political levels almost the whole century."</seg>
<seg id="1881">"recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-caliber cases of corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this locality, including one in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman escaped military attack."</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months before the readers of Valdez had considered the best informed source about the abduction.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"once we had known what happened," "said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname" El Flaco "because of his slender body stature."</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication are broken with our sources."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"Valdez's office has been converted to storage space for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists, because employees have become something they themselves never expected: activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">"reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few characters, and the next morning went to a demonstration for another journalist to the office of the prosecutor."</seg>
<seg id="1888">"Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western state of Michoacan."</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body has been discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is its.</seg>
<seg id="1890">"throughout the country, journalists have become more phonetic by writing them in organized protests" SOS Press "on walkways and buildings."</seg>
<seg id="1891">"on that day, director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Valdez."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"at a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to spy out journalists and bring them around because they have said the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"since then she has asked for her to be divided again by the government, because she is worried that her anger has violated her objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime, involved government officials and an equal society."</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" Narco-Journalism, "he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the command of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a ceiling with organised crime."</seg>
<seg id="1896">"last year, the media guard group" Articulo 19 "has more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials."</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico you die, because they want you to keep your mouth," "said Ramirez."</seg>
<seg id="1898">"obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect."</seg>
<seg id="1899">Nobody forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Her body was found along with a note that was supposed to be signed by the Zetas-Kartell: "here I am because of my reports.</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and earphones lay down beside their separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">"some branches have chosen to close, like the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state Chihuahua after the assassination of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March."</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue to do as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of her director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">"in 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the title page with the title" What do you want from us? ""</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"it is hard to find work in exile, and they are still watching the streets and looking for dangers."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"and sometimes they are hunted, as evidently the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight from Veracruz."</seg>
<seg id="1909">"for those who stay behind and continue their work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1910">"Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that drug trafficking is frightened by him."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico goes to hell, and so I became reporter," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="1912">"at midnight last Friday, when the last issue was already finished, the editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer when all her telephones began buzzing."</seg>
<seg id="1913">"a number of shootings with rifle rivals and security forces near Mazatlan, a seaside resort, had left 19 confirmed dead."</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war continued escalated as promised by a number of cartel embassies in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1915">From the brothel edge they published the news on the website of Feodoce via mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The title page had to be changed the next day.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Sirens howl nearby - another shooting in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Bojorquez threw a look at the police officers who kept watch to see if they were willing.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"if they were afraid at all, they did not show it."</seg>
<seg id="1920">"under the mighty portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible for all Sinaloa, the employees of Riodoce followed his tracks."</seg>
<seg id="1921">"how can you just think about it," "said Bojorquez," "when the same day Javier was murdered, the intern asked me to send them to the street."</seg>
<seg id="1922">Dinosaurs used cloak to avoid his enemies</seg>
<seg id="1923">"at first sight it looks like a statue, albeit a frightening."</seg>
<seg id="1924">"now, researchers have discovered that the first findings of the incredible Nashort of a Canadian miner were so well received that experts described it as" Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs. ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">"it was so well received that she could even realize that his scaly skin was of reddish brown - and they said she would have had something of a" "troubled past". ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">"the report in the journal" Current Biology "referred to him as" the preserved armoured dinosaur, who was ever found, and one of the best dinosaur copies of the world. "</seg>
<seg id="1927">The fossil is a newly discovered species of Noah-Terrier who lived in the middle of the Cretaceous years between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1928">"his amazingly well-preserved condition has astonished researchers, who describe it as" truly remarkable. ""</seg>
<seg id="1929">"according to reports in National Geographic, the armored herbivores is the best preserved fossil in its kind."</seg>
<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn Funk when he was in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the North of Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met something that seemed out of place from the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The Fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years to uncover the wild beast within the 2,500 pound (1,100 kg) heavy earth clump."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you only blindfold a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it has slept," "said the chief autor Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs, the Mona Lisa the dinosaur."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers found that these herbivores, although covered with armor and resembles a changing tank, probably was threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white cloak to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as a counter-protection, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this would have allowed to blend better with its surroundings and avoid its enemies, experts say, suggesting that it was threatened by bigger dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million year old creature from the family of the Nodosaurier made headlines for the first time in May and is now visible at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild animal and called Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team who has spent more than 7,000 hours with it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing conservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of shed and armor over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the counter-shading, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, meaning that the top of the creature was darker than their underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the counter shading is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of the today living animals."</seg>
<seg id="1945">It suggests that the dinosaur was driven by enough pressure by eating meat-eating dinosaurs that evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most contemporary animals that use the counter-shading - think of deer, zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and vulnerable than loot, which signals that this nodose-dinosaur was exposed to a real struggle for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"powerful predator behavior on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaurs carnivores must have been the Cretaceous Time," Brown said. "</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to investigate the animal in evidence of his life, including his preserved intestinal content, to find out what it has eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaur, when he died, fell into a river and drifted into the sea, where he sunk on his back to the sea floor."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time, Alberta was as warm as southern florida today, and rivers and oceans probably farther inland than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved flaky skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal," Brown said. "</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal looks almost exactly as in the early Cretaceous period.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you do not need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. if you only slay a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that he is asleep."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the Cretaceous period was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, standing on two legs, crossed the earth."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived after Borealopelta million years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his frightening ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"the scientists, whose latest findings are published in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and mumified in mud."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk when he was in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the North of Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the preserved armoured dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the creatures were average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long spikes that raved off his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored herbivores were swung by western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater cremation of the dinosaur kept his armour in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the Hautreste cover still bumpy armoured plates along the dinosaur</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as rare as a win in the lottery."</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I approach it, the more confusing it becomes."</seg>
<seg id="1968">Petrified remnants of the skin still cover the bumpy armoured plates that carry the skull of the animal.</seg>
<seg id="1969">"his right forefoot lies on his side, his five fingers are spiced upwards."</seg>

<seg id="1976">"at first, there was no indication of the exact number of injuries."</seg>
<seg id="1977">"it was mild to moderate injury, said a police spokesman."</seg>
<seg id="1978">A large number of emergency vehicles had been charged at the accident site.</seg>

<seg id="1999">"in order to be able to use them, some requirements must be met: you need a smartphone or tablet."</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to book an online ticket - which is already the most passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2001">"it is also necessary to buy it via the app of the train, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way of booking a ticket."</seg>

<seg id="2022">She stumbled across a post from someone from the High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"the police have just killed a 18-year-old child, and it is still on the road," "said it."</seg>
<seg id="2024">"confused as nobody else posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly saved on their timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"the rapper in the area of St. Louis was to tweets the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo."</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted an image of Browns lifeless body stretching out on the street and staying there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"that's wild," Ferrell thought. "</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new to them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She put her cell phone off to return later in the evening to tweets about people on the Canfield-Drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos of the police band and people that cried out, and from a man who claimed to be Browns's father who wore a sign with the inscription:" Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son! "</seg>
<seg id="2032">She watched a live feed where a policeman was standing in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said, another policeman took his gun and cried," "I will kill you... animals all." ""</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not common," "recalls Ferrell on her statement."</seg>
<seg id="2035">This is not the kind of murder we have used to and which we can call.</seg>
<seg id="2036">At that moment I felt shivers.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After landing at 11 pm she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary," Whose Streets?, "in the cinemas from the 11th century."</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a history of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance that exists from the point of view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as Ferrell with her daughter, who carried a flower dress and a suitable crown, drove to Ferguson, the two discussed a conversation that they had" "had the black experience and the black condition innumerable times before this morning." ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in?" "she remembered what she said."</seg>
<seg id="2044">We now go to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take her away," Ferrell said later. "</seg>
<seg id="2046">What has happened today is a high point of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know and see it and be educated in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed not only of activism and organization, but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves to liberate ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I am lucky to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience a blatant racism, she is not different from the next black women's child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">I feel I would have a bad service to keep them away from it.</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was on the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which became a camp area when the activists waited for the possible non-prosecution of Officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"there, Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch."</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags before and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell's shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism totally changed after August 9," she said and noted that she as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis was President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communes. "</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Everything has come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan during an evening demonstration, one of the film's co-directors."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said she and her cameraman, Lucas Alvarado-Farrar, wanted to" document "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"one question came from Ferrell:" "do you want to document or try to find a story that you can take advantage of?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this scepticism was nourished by innumerable cases of people, often from whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resilience."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan recently stated in an interview:" "we heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson have not centered their voices, and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan had already worked together with the co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todestrakt."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"his commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals followed the team of" Whose Streets? "in the years after Browns's shooting."</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone talking to us or talking to us. we talk," "said Davis."</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me, as these people are represented, because so I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was not to concentrate on Ferrel's experience - to show that it is not a Messiah-leader but a community that comes together," "said Folayan - it turned out to be the most obvious participant in the film."</seg>
<seg id="2068">"as a result, documents from" Whose Streets "show surprising personal aspects of Ferrell's life as she falls in love with her wife."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," "said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and the dehumanization of black people.</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferris's history repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives-Matter movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, who have shaped the film" Blacklive Matter "in social media after killing the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, identify themselves as gay."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall," "said Ferrell," "and so we are constantly fighting on different fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women must carry the main burden of all."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"" "Folayan agreed to notice that" "the movement really is held up by black women and many black women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2076">"she insists, however, that" this is not an affirmative type of action, "at which Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film due to her identity."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who shook this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is not a coincidence, although it was at the forefront because in a life on these crossings as a black gay woman there is so much on the game."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial links between the municipality and the police continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on probation for 2 ½ years because of the blocking of a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">"she still clings to a song, and she feels bound to this memory since she walked into Ferguson three years ago."</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We must love and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "megalomania": TV readers discuss about bit gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">"the Bit Gallery moves people, although they are not built for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone splits people into proponents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The issue is hardly cold.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"on our Facebook page" Volksfreund Bitburg, "the topic is discussed."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"while some say to the bit gallery:" that would be a dream "(Anja Becker) or" That's really great "(Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side:" don't need a person "(Siggi Betzen) or simply:" megalomania! "(Lars Scholz)."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while the proponents build that a gallery attracts more customers, the other shops also benefit, the opponents fear that the pedestrian area is bleeding."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"in addition, the gallery is planned precisely on the property on which the farmer's market hall stands, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"with the beginning of the construction works, the end will be finished."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"the gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building, namely to the Beda Square with the opportunity to sit outside."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"Simone Zimmer:" "we've been buying almost every week in the farmer's market for many years."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the farm women are always very happy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">We also discovered the butcher's shop for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">"we would like to wish that, even during and, especially after the construction of the gallery, there is a chance to maintain this offer."</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is that too.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether direct marketers live in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">"however, this should not be low in the new project."</seg>
<seg id="2106">"Eva Kilic:" "what's the most important shopping list in Bitburg?"</seg>
<seg id="2107">"whether clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I find that unnecessary."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There are already enough of this in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but since there is not even a regular weekly market, it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the goods offered there are fresh, mostly offered directly from the producer and is inexpensive."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you can see, shops in a shopping mall are only rented by larger companies, as the renting shops are often not portable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"what a pity, specialty shops are almost no longer available and what is left of them will probably disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping mall with a market hall doesn't fit together for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all: where should the farmer's market hall be?</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the old Edeka would be the solution, even if the bit gallery actually comes."</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does the ghostly bit gallery already manage to sell all shops from Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "that will just not work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping center that is empty, nobody needs."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farmer's market instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"but for a farmer's market hall, thanks to the insane many - as I find - senseless construction projects in Bitburg no longer place."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"when the farmers market hall is destroyed, a piece of culture will disappear again."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York, there are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which almost identically resemble the cables hanging from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tuppers and haircuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former secret service analyst served a 35-year custodial sentence after publicly classified diplomatic reports on WikiLeaks website."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition, opened on August 2nd, is called A Becoming resemblance (a fitting similarity)."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"she is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline reconciled her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a trans-woman and groundbreaking dissident, whose conviction was changed by Barack Obama, when he only had three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"through algorithmic analysis of the DNA, which was extracted by man and created from the 30 portraits, how someone with these genomic data could look a sharp, albeit somewhat intellectual commentary not only to the formability of DNA data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but had already spoken openly about identification as a woman since her puberty, was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"her image was suppressed by the prison, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-white selfie, in which Manning obviously sits on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum-blonde wig - with which she was associated."</seg>
<seg id="2133">"in 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came from the huge success of its 2012 project" Stranger Visions. ""</seg>
<seg id="2134">The artist produced portraits of forensic artefacts like cigarette buttocks and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to make a picture of how these people could look.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in jail and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," "explained Dewey-Hagborg during a press preview of the new exhibition."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"she couldn't visit her at that time and she could not be photographed, so they contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"the artist and her incarcerated mice became an unequal spectacle, which in the course of two years exchanged several letters."</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created a Comic" Suppressed Images "illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, who foresaw a future in which the president would transform his judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"that Obama was indeed just a few days after the book was published, Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy meeting."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also at the opening of the exhibition something deep and strong, since Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new tweetable ways to fix the rigid divisions that he should actually fix."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"when Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said that" things happen for a certain reason. "</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning asked with her oversized signature (the" i "in her family name is equipped with a heart) an end to" automatic fragmentation, based on gender, race, sexuality and culture. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall is its mitochondrial DNA sequence - an exchange of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides after the highly developed scientific glossary of the artist), as surprisingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take with it is that our genome does not care who we are and how open genetic data for interpretation and how subjectively they are," "said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is a page from the above-mentioned comic-novel."</seg>
<seg id="2149">"she shows Manning, how she emerges with a hands-free phone in hand from the United States disciplinary battleships like King Kong."</seg>
<seg id="2150">"when they make your speech cold, then they won," "says it."</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so, never stop the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter she wrote to me," "said the artist who greetings from Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">I still get goosebumps when I talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but when she was supposed to do it, she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks from her own genomic simulations, which gather like hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"this was also aimed at how everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5" 2, Manning Statur), where their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past, I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," "said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits."</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was also hiding behind its liberation."</seg>
<seg id="2158">Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of Oxford University for killing</seg>
<seg id="2159">"a nation-wide chase is going on for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University who were looking for suspects, after a man was stabbed in a luxurious Chicago apartment with deadly injuries."</seg>
<seg id="2160">On Monday for Wyndham Lathemen (42) and Andrew Warren (56) arrest warrants were issued for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.</seg>
<seg id="2161">"the documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches."</seg>
<seg id="2162">A communal warning system published by the Chicago police authority states that the dead body was discovered on 27 July.</seg>
<seg id="2163">"officials received a call, arrived at Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body."</seg>
<seg id="2164">"Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead at the site of the event, and detectives investigate the stitches as murder while the police actively seek the two suspects, said civil servants."</seg>
<seg id="2165">Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="2166">"Alan K. Cubensis, vice-president for university relations, said in an e-mail explaining that Lathem had now been in a rating and excluded from entering the campus of Northwestern University."</seg>
<seg id="2167">"this is now a criminal case investigated by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University cooperates with this investigation," said Cubensis. "</seg>
<seg id="2168">Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.</seg>
<seg id="2169">"a speaker at the University and the Somerville College said in an email statement that" "we are in contact with the police in the UK and ready to help US investigators in every way possible."</seg>
<seg id="2170">The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to stand up.</seg>
<seg id="2171">"chief Communications Officer of Chicago, Anthony Guglielmi, said he urges the suspects to submit to the authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them strengthen," "said Guglielmi."</seg>
<seg id="2173">"Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities help to find the suspects."</seg>
<seg id="2174">"Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received an enigmatic tip that said something happened in apartment 1008."</seg>
<seg id="2175">The police described the scene very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July.</seg>
<seg id="2177">It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathemes and Warren were in the building.</seg>
<seg id="2178">"we believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," "said Guglielmi."</seg>
<seg id="2179">"the Grand Plaza's management team published an explanation to the residents:" "the police are currently working on the timeline and the background of the victim and explores a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."</seg>
<seg id="2180">"we will complete the WADA roadmap in the near future" - the Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko</seg>
<seg id="2181">Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it won't take a long time until the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti-doping agency (RUSADA).</seg>
<seg id="2182">"at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, RUSADA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping)."</seg>
<seg id="2183">"the WADA roadmap has been updated in this respect," "explained Mutko on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="2184">"the PM commented on the second part of WADA's schedule to comply with the code, which describes the criteria for the re-implementation of RUSADA and was recently published on the organization's website."</seg>
<seg id="2185">"according to Mutko, he doesn't have anything to give concern to Russia."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"everything was announced, everything is being implemented."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," "he added."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"one of the criteria mentioned in the list, however, states that the Russian anti-doping authorities have to publicly accept the reported results of the study approved by the WADA by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren for alleged state-supported doping in Russian sport."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"in relation to the matter, Mutko said:" "we carry out the investigation because our anti-doping system has caused an error."</seg>
<seg id="2190">All measures have been implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2191">"but there were no governmental programs, and we will not admit anything that does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="2192">"Mutkos's words were consistent with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the leader of the independent Russian anti-doping commission."</seg>
<seg id="2193">"in conversation with the Russian sales office at the beginning of the day, Smirnov announced problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added:" "we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations."</seg>
<seg id="2194">"no one has to accept this report unconditionally," "Smirnov added."</seg>
<seg id="2195">"in November 2015, RUSADA was excluded from the use of doping control in Russia in the course of doping scandals by the WADA."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"however, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD)."</seg>

<seg id="2209">A new breed of Human Resources Start-ups is at waxing to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">"by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee's commitment, it enables companies to offer surveys, specialize groups and demographic groups, employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases whistleblowers allow to bypass the C-Suite managers and turn directly to the Board of Directors."</seg>

<seg id="2355">"in the middle of July, Erdogan had another 7395 State officials fired by decree, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers."</seg>
<seg id="2356">It seemed as if Erdogan had tamed the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">The generals were formerly considered the masters of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"three times, they listened to their role as guardians of the secular state."</seg>
<seg id="2359">"after his election victory in 2002, Erdogan was pushing back the power of the military step by step, not least by calling on the reform requirements of the European Union."</seg>

<seg id="2389">"just as you thought it can't become even more crazy in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots arrives."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"yes, in fact."</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">"recently, Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for Responsible Robotik) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years."</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we have to start taking their Ascension seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye colour of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make fun of them, but companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more often," "said Mr. Sharkey on the release of his new report."</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex mannequins have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can" "adjust" "his robot accordingly and select everything from the eye colour of the robot through the shape of the nipples to the type or colour of his fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but it becomes even more disturbing, as many robots have the" personalities "that would make a stepford wife look progressive."</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex mannequins have evolved into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the RealBotix robot allows for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness."</seg>
<seg id="2401">"and then there is the Roxxxxy gold sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities like" Frigid Farrah, "which conveys the impression of shyness and" Wild Wendy "with an" adventurous "personality."</seg>
<seg id="2402">"RoxxxGold has a personality adapted to your personality as well as possible," enthuses the website of True Companion. "</seg>
<seg id="2403">"so she likes what you like, and she likes not what you don't like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day she also has her moods - quite like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"she can be tired, be fixed on conversation, or she can be" in mood "!"</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive feminine features, the allusions to rape, when one goes a step towards Frigid (means here: reluctant) Farrah, disturb most."</seg>
<seg id="2407">"on his website true Companion Roxxxxy with a vibrator, but for men."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men not have Roxxxxy?" "</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"their formation and increasing refinement point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition."</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men will of course not hold any sex robots, and while the FRR notices their increasing popularity, they still remain on the verge of consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what seeps out of the fringe can be very instructive in relation to the spirit of time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">"there is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots are emerging in a time where women's rights are threatened worldwide, in which there is a president in the White House who has shown that women have been sexually assaulted."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"the most terrible aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The report of the maid ') are not the graphic images, the entwined body and the stochrome eyes, but how realistically this vision works."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap."</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as technically possible (albeit with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel humanely that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, when it comes to their" personages, "the robots do not represent real women."</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate or simply go away from their companion.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"they have no mediation or background story, nothing that indicates independence or anything that might disturb the fantasy of total submission."</seg>

<seg id="2432">"with Trump in the White House everyone who knows it, including the republican relationship with which she had fought for decades because of politics suddenly and quite strange on the same page."</seg>

<seg id="2437">"today, I find myself infested by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's original version of the madman - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked like) - both in comparison to Trump in fact seem to be a very mild crime."</seg>
<seg id="2438">"when Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republican only needs to be mentally healthy in order to qualify as an immeasurable improvement."</seg>

<seg id="2537">"for 31 years, Wacker has been a city engineer."</seg>
<seg id="2538">And the work is still a lot of fun for him as he talks in the press conference.</seg>
<seg id="2539">"he reports of varied, but also demanding tasks that await his successor."</seg>
<seg id="2540">"at the same time, it is wonderful that no application has yet fulfilled the requirements profile."</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible date.</seg>
<seg id="2542">"in this way, considering the regular periods of notice, there will still be enough time for a revision."</seg>
<seg id="2543">"since Haslach acts as a sub-contractor for the administration community, the applicant has to provide appropriate conclusions."</seg>
<seg id="2544">Because this function wants to keep the city alive.</seg>
<seg id="2545">"if they were unable to fill them out, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg."</seg>
<seg id="2546">"but closeness to the town is important to the city and to it itself, says Wacker, who reports from a good working atmosphere and good atmosphere between the authorities and citizens."</seg>
<seg id="2547">"in more than 30 years in ministry, some important projects have accumulated to look back on the Wacker with pride."</seg>
<seg id="2548">"we make the city worth living," "he is sure about the building department and his staff."</seg>
<seg id="2549">"but also in the future, varied projects are on the agenda: the redesign of the former Hukla Areas and the Niederhofen parking lot have been initiated."</seg>
<seg id="2550">"the bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed, even the stadium renovation is still a topic."</seg>
<seg id="2551">"the latter alone will book with some 1.5 million euros," if we do it right, "Wacker appreciates."</seg>
<seg id="2552">"all in all, great tasks await my successor."</seg>
<seg id="2553">The work here is fun. "</seg>
<seg id="2554">"in terms of design, there is a lot of room for a city building master."</seg>
<seg id="2555">Haslach's own farm and gardener can react very flexibly to many.</seg>
<seg id="2556">"you can move a lot," says Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors. "</seg>
<seg id="2557">"as the Old Town as an ensemble is listed as a listed monument, it is important to" have an eye on what fits in, "when new buildings are approved, the retiring Stadtbaumeister stresses."</seg>
<seg id="2558">"anyway, the Stadtbaumeister has a high responsibility."</seg>
<seg id="2559">"he is builder," in the end everything runs over my table. "</seg>

<seg id="2562">"continuity is not only important for a good working climate, but also for the further design of the city."</seg>
<seg id="2563">Those who want to be buried in Roland Wacker should have a completed degree as a diploma in the town of Haslach as a diploma engineer or a bachelor's degree in architecture and have a good knowledge of the fields of construction and construction planning.</seg>

<seg id="2566">"according to the police, the previously unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bike on the lines of the rail track in the area of the Leobener Straße (B116)."</seg>
<seg id="2567">These were damaged so strongly that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2568">The investigators go out of two male perpetrators and have been looking for them since the night hours.</seg>
<seg id="2569">"near the crime scene, a rosy scooter and a bike rider had been observed by witnesses."</seg>
<seg id="2570">"this goes far beyond a Lausbub region," said ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch to the APA. "</seg>

<seg id="2572">"in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the equipment, as well as the delay-ride and the costs for rail freight traffic, the railway customers could also pay attention to the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2573">"all in all, it was a" "substantial" "sum, the speaker said."</seg>
<seg id="2574">"the damage was rectified on Friday afternoon, the railway traffic on the south track could be carried out without hindrances."</seg>
<seg id="2575">"almost ten people had dropped out on Friday morning, two of which were watching long-distance traffic."</seg>
<seg id="2576">"freight trains did not fall off, but they had delay."</seg>
<seg id="2577">"according to ÖBB spokesman, Christoph Posch had to exchange about 200 metres of overhead lines."</seg>
<seg id="2578">Insulators and masts were also damaged.</seg>
<seg id="2579">"red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help relieve IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)"</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">"but a new study says exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable state, which affects approximately 1.3 million and 300,000 in the United States, causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurring or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"during the sufferers usually get to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers found out at the University of Washington that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the gut patrol to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in the food do not penetrate the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">"cells that are capable of triggering inflammation, are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue."</seg>
<seg id="2586">"if the balance is too far towards inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments have found that a kind of tolerance promotes immune cells in mice that carry a specific bacterium in their intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to replace the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" "we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet tolerant of tryptophan, more tolerable, less inflammatory bowel milieus, if the same system works in humans as well."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"post-doctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune cell promoting tolerance when it found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, but which had not been separated."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"they suspected that the difference with the intestinal microbial mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the intestines of the mice were DNA sequenced and six bacterial species were found, which were present in mice with the immune cells, but without them missing in the mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they lacked an intestinal microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"to understand how bacteria spread to the immune system, the researchers let L. reuteri grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on immature immune cells isolated from the mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"when the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, known as idol-3 lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"if the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan were halved, the number of cells decreased by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan stated that people have the same tolerant cells as mice and that most of us L. reuteri protect in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether tryptophan-by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as with mice, but defects in genes in relationship to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2602">She said: "the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammations on the inner surface of the intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potential high tryptophan values can potentially lead to an extension of this population in the presence of L. reuteri. "</seg>

<seg id="2676">"at that time, in the development area I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount."</seg>
<seg id="2677">"in the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016, the surplus was still 60 percent."</seg>
<seg id="2678">"for Schindler, the previous renovations are a" "successful project" "- it is also important to promote internal development, not only to open up new areas of construction."</seg>
<seg id="2679">"on April 4, the government presidium Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a redevelopment area III."</seg>
<seg id="2680">"the funding amount was 833 333 Euro, of which 500 000 euros would come from the country, the rest of the commune's sensibilities."</seg>
<seg id="2681">How does a remediation area arise?</seg>
<seg id="2682">"so Schindler will continue to investigate where the" "really old" "houses are."</seg>
<seg id="2683">"but it also plays a role, whether in the planned area, there is interest at all to rehabilitate."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"if necessary, the territorial boundaries could then also be postponed again."</seg>
<seg id="2685">"the bridge was represented on Wednesday evening Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel."</seg>
<seg id="2686">"cellar presented the contents of the federal government program" "Social City", "in which the rehabilitations would then be carried out."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"core of the program is the revitalization of inner cities, improving living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="2688">"the measures would be carried out object-related, i.e. per property."</seg>
<seg id="2689">The redevelopment area would then be defined as a statute.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The approval period for funding runs since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.</seg>
<seg id="2691">"until September this year, however, the inventory took place only once, within the scope of which the participants had a questionnaire to fill out the questionnaire."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"in November or December, the statute will take place as soon as possible, so that the restructurings can begin next year."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"afterwards, Pietzschmann explained that every Commune needed to carry out the aforementioned preliminary investigations."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"it is about assessing the urbanistic grievances, and deciding when to refurbish and to what extent."</seg>
<seg id="2695">There will also be a redevelopment notice in the land register for the respective plot.</seg>
<seg id="2696">"Pietzschmann will come again after sensation and make a picture of the situation, she promised."</seg>
<seg id="2697">Gotzel emphasised that the project is a key success factor for the project.</seg>
<seg id="2698">"for this reason, there will be questionnaires sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be completed by the end of the summer holidays."</seg>
<seg id="2699">"the yellow questionnaire is the" "building and land arc", "in which it is about the structural condition and the renovation plans."</seg>
<seg id="2700">"in the grey questionnaire, the" household and housing arch, "information on size, segmentation and residents of a living room can be made."</seg>
<seg id="2701">The blue "operating arc" is only to be filled out when operating premises in the building.</seg>
<seg id="2702">"however, to be observed, Gotzel indicated that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding."</seg>
<seg id="2703">"in addition, new construction measures are not eligible."</seg>

<seg id="2717">"President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and executive officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries."</seg>
<seg id="2718">"built in Connecticut, the helicopter was placed next to a Maine Yacht, a Wisconsin firefighter and a forklift from Mississippi."</seg>
<seg id="2719">"the White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or Frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter."</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," "wrote the HMX-1 commander on the eve of the event to his superior, the deputy commander of Naval Aviation."</seg>
<seg id="2721">The message showed that the helicopter arrived at 7 o'clock in the morning at 7 o'clock in the morning on the South Lawn for the event at 3pm and until the grass was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00 this evening.</seg>
<seg id="2722">"the note adds that if the departure from the White House was delayed, a second crew would be required for the return flight due to the limitation of the service hours."</seg>
<seg id="2723">"the original flight crew was during the event at the helicopter, while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the aircraft."</seg>
<seg id="2724">"from the records provided by the TIME, it was not clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required."</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act forbids federal states to use state property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Datasets indicate that HMX-1 has asked if the event could violate the destination.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case," "wrote the commandant."</seg>
<seg id="2728">"sounds as if you are locked," "answered the deputy commander."</seg>
<seg id="2729">"the event" "Made in America" "was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act."</seg>
<seg id="2730">But official events also have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="2731">"at the event, the President gave an impetus to the reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate and he propagated the efforts to curb government regulations."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"the use of the aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, is hardly a new phenomenon from politically advantageous purposes."</seg>

<seg id="2746">The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "the cost of taxpayers based on estimates for reimbursement rates is highly misleading," "said Walters."</seg>
<seg id="2748">"these estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds."</seg>
<seg id="2749">"according to a RAND study from 2015, the refills for DoD do not include personnel costs, but also take into account the costs of fuel, maintenance and conclusion of the contract."</seg>
<seg id="2750">"at that time, the former press spokesman of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event."</seg>

<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the misuse cases is relieved by Pope brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This means author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the misuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen continues for discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">"Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement" We are Church, "stated after publication in relation to the German press agency, he expected from the former Regensburg bishop and present-day Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the Cathedral master Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the rejected Pope Benedict XVI, an apology."</seg>
<seg id="2893">"it would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church, when Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret about their own omissions or at that time false assessment of the events."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"the Vatican newspaper" Osservatore Romano, "on the other hand, criticised that in reporting about violence among the dome-cats with" double standards. ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">"no one doubted that it was" shameful and shameful acts "that would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the" degree of media manipulation, "the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the National Italian Bioethics committee."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit of calling the Catholic Church as the source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep it normal," writes Scaraffia. "</seg>
<seg id="2897">"Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis, too, said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk:" we are happy to go to the church and that is a spotted fresco. "</seg>
<seg id="2898">"in addition, she pointed out that" "strikes have been a quite normal educational tool" "in her youth," "to be done with cheeky children as I was one."</seg>
<seg id="2899">"it would be unfair to apply today's standards to previous decades, as the world has changed."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"in connection with reports on the abuse of abuse, pope-brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"completely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger the memorabilia" "My brother of the pope" "(translated into 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection," "says Hesemann," "for all this had nothing to do with him," "he evaluates the results of the final report."</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report submitted by the Bistum Regensburg with the Enlightenment German lawyer Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"a total of 547 Regensburger domsparrows were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s" with high plausibility "victims of attacks, 67 domain cats."</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report, it is said to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994:" in summary, it can be said that R. Domkapellmeister R. has used forms of physical and psychological violence in many cases. "</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially with high emotionality the punishment for the students could also be more intense.</seg>
<seg id="2907">"in contrast to numerous other defendants, however, many victims argue that many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even positive memories with him in spite of violence."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the misuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger was relieved."</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the incidents of abuse of violence against the" Regensburger Domspatzen, "is a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2910">"on the one hand, many students highlight his" humanity. ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"on the other hand, he also appears as a choline and perfectionist, who became tangible by the eye when a domain of music did not bring top performance musically."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as its biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: if you make the effort and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is found at all."</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is devoted just once to eight pages and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses at the pre-school were also expropriated outside of his sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">"at best, one can reproach him of having heard of it too late or not having taken first indications seriously enough."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the Domspatzengymnasium, on which it worked, was felt by practically all respondents as - literally -" redemption, "" heaven "and" better world. ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"the broad majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also presents an excellent testimony, describing him as" warm-hearted, "" sincere, "" competent "and" understanding, "as an extremely good-natured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and candy and" always surrounded by grapes from children. ""</seg>
<seg id="2919">"only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which also led to breakthroughs."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"he did not only kneel with chairs and threw the keys on the floor, but also parted earposts and too cheeky guys on the hair or ears, he himself had already admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"to his salvation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the questionable time, the 1960s and the 1970s, both parents and teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think each of us who was born before 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I have also experienced this in a secular school, a state Gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what is actually going on in this report, namely the horrific sexual abuse and the excesses of violence at the preschool, that is, of course, Bagatella."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"you wonder if it's not with his fame and his role as brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just rushed to him."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"at the Bavarian Pope, many who have never understood him are still zealous."</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves George Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in the media, in connection with the report a lot has been reported on the topic of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger see any involvement or complicity in regard to sexual abuse in the final report?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to be entrusted with the master's master.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I never dared to talk to my father or my mother about it," "said an affected person on behalf of the others," "it was all very embarrassing to me."</seg>
<seg id="2935">"the real problem in the education of sexual abuse, however, is that most victims are silent."</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they didn't even commit themselves to parents and siblings, then definitely not a choral leader, who would have been professionally a colleague of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do we evaluate Ratzinger's Ratzinger's role in the context of the abuse of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student put it this way: "regarding sexual abuse... I do not see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely knowledge and could have been able to stop the respective perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I consider it... also for really absurd to assume that all of it would have opened up to him... boys more penetrable or clearer, or rather opened more than to their parents, boarding teachers, trust teachers, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That you talk to him about sex... unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"in this way, the report concludes with the clear result:" that the student and / or their environment entrusted to him in the run-up could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation. "</seg>
<seg id="2942">"as for sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is therefore free to speak of any sympathy."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"in this way, he cannot be accused of being prevented or killed."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore, there is no reason to establish its good name with these conflicting crimes, as it happened in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"in the media, there was much talk of" violence excesses "at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2946">"the former master master Georg Ratzinger is presented in the report" "Waiting to look". ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem in reporting everything mixed and mixed up to a huge amount of sexual abuse and violence, and somewhere in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">But exactly this is an abuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"there is a clean separation between the pre-school and the secondary school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violence, as well as we say once, other allegations."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"the report also deals with incidents from the period since 1945, so also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir director of the Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole awful test pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were victimized and painted, and among them were appalling, expropriated all at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen where really scandalous conditions have reigned."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"however, with them Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys first to face when they were already on the gynecologist gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on that, as most of the witnesses emphasize, the subject of" "pre-school" "taboo."</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradise" conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different from the gymnasium gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hesemann: there was discipline already, but no sadistic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and, therefore, in many cases even positive memories with him in spite of violence. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">"at the most, the reproach remains to have looked out."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"however, despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre-school."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was not working and was responsible, (so the witness) didn't want to hear anything, and then only back in 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger consistently hide the ears from the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, who even reproduced the report."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this he points out this," that the examiner will continue to practice the punishment in the pre-school. "</seg>
<seg id="2965">"already in view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"this was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, as Prüfer's penalties in Bavaria have long since been banned."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before that, they acquired a legal grey area, as each one of us knows still."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"it was hard to estimate for him, where those affected were perhaps exaggerated or dramatized, and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="2969">"but you can't say, he always looked away."</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">"only in 1980, the punishment of schools in Bavaria was officially abolished."</seg>
<seg id="2972">"Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis asserted that it was unfair to apply today's educational standards to the time at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we historians are talking about the" "pitfalls of anachronism", "i.e. the danger of assessing the past according to today's moral standards."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess is right there.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but this of course does not apply to sexual abuse, which has been abhorred at all times and also not for what has been verbalized in the pre-school of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond the usual practice."</seg>
<seg id="2977">It's all very awful and I'm glad that it will finally be worked out.</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time, I have to take protection from Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his means of disciplining and punishment, so to draw earnest and to the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"when physical punishment was forbidden, he was strictly adhered to."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"what picture of his Regensburg time has Georg Ratzinger played in the talks with you for the book" "My brother of the pope" "?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the subject of testing also available for speech?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI tells from his perspective, there the Cathedral sparrows played only a minor role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I do not conceal that he led a strict regiment there."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but this also has to be said: without this perfectionism, without requiring unconditionally discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world drinking from the hitherto quite nationally famous Regensburger Domspatzen, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and candies alone you don't even make a big singer and stand before every success, regardless of the area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming."</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people did Georg Ratzinger experienced during the talks with her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and again and again experienced as wonderful, humorous, fundamental, deeply believing and heartfelt people, from whom you can't imagine that he could only do something for a fly."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I regularly receive regular contact with him, like many former Domspatzen, 23 years after his imprisonment, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who do not forgive him until this day, that he once was stern to them, are clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the cathedral cats are thankful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought them near to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovable respectful person, to whom they still look up and whom they almost revere."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, again clearly: all you reproach him are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have long overcame this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is most unjust, a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a medial scapegoat."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"there is the evil intention behind it, all too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for the report, which has just been published, relieves him."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the war would stop, a 93-year-old man who has earned great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany nobody would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace."</seg>
