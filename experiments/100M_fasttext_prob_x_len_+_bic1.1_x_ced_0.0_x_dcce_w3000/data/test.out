28 @-@ year @-@ old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
&quot; a 28 @-@ year @-@ old cook , who recently moved to San Francisco , was found dead in the stair@@ well of a local mall . &quot;
&quot; the victim &apos;s brother said he couldn &apos;t imagine anyone who would harm him , &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally it went up with him again . &quot;
&quot; the body found on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field Mall was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gali@@ cia from San Francisco , divided the geri@@ chts@@ medical department in San Francisco . &quot;
the San Francisco Police Department said that death was classified as murder and the investigations are underway .
&quot; the brother of the victim , Louis Gali@@ cia , told the ABS TV station K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who previously worked as a cook in Boston , had his dream job as a cook in the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters Restaurant in San Francisco six months ago . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ man of the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said they were &quot; &quot; shocked and destroyed &quot; &quot; about his death . &quot;
&quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot;
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are at this difficult time with Fran@@ ks &apos;s family and friends .
&quot; Louis Gali@@ cia admitted that Frank was initially living in Host@@ els , but that &quot; things for him finally went uphill . &quot;
&quot; he found an apartment , he had a friend , &quot; &quot; shared Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot;
Louis Gali@@ cia said he couldn &apos;t imagine anyone who would harm his younger brother .
he was a friendly person with a great heart .
&quot; connecting his way with his family was to cook us for dinner , to prepare dinner , &quot; said Louis Gali@@ cia . &quot;
he never wanted to participate in any kind of confrontation .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the stream .
&quot; in everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond , who lit up bright every day , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
anyone who has information about the case will be asked to call the SF@@ PD &apos;s consec@@ ration on the number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always stuck in drawers
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston does not always have to be perfect or successful .
this has made the Hollywood star in an interview un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally clear .
&quot; I &apos;m always placed in drawers or past@@ ed from outside label , which usually have little to do with me and reality . &quot;
I myself do not have the desire to always be perfect and successful .
&quot; to be honest , these things are rather dum@@ b . &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about the fact that she is considered &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current Cos@@ m@@ opolitan .
&quot; the act@@ ress likes to spend her time at home , pre@@ m television with lo@@ cker@@ le de@@ br@@ is and mexican food , it is in the magazine . &quot;
&quot; for white glu@@ t , she brings the question of the child &apos;s wish : &quot; &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; says the Hollywood star . &quot;
&quot; in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s play , &quot; Ani@@ ston is a single parent of two sons . &quot;
the film runs on the 25th of August .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the Sports Pyr@@ amid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
&quot; at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger was looking for a little change with some colleagues on the beach . &quot;
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; gold Sports Pyr@@ amid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a few minutes , the horses remembered their holiday , they ch@@ ased at home in the fast gal@@ lo@@ p home to the food rou@@ ghs . &quot;
&quot; one kilometer at that speed , I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says . &quot;
and so the riding career ended again .
&quot; on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer was - 101 tournament victories - again in the vicinity of horses . &quot;
&quot; he had his family run over the complex of the AL@@ RV , he did not even swear by a horse for photographic purposes . &quot;
long was the first time in Aachen and thus also at CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
&quot; the German sporting aid handed over the man from An@@ hausen during a small gala , the Golden Sports Pyr@@ amid . &quot;
there is no lack of distinc@@ tions for the symp@@ athetic ath@@ lete .
&quot; Federal Cross of Mer@@ it , Silver Lau@@ rel leaf , Champions Tour Player of the year ... &quot;
even the British Queen has already beg@@ ged him .
the 18th winner of the Sports Pyr@@ amid is long .
in Aachen he met the first lau@@ re@@ ate Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements , but also for social commitment . &quot;
&quot; for decades , Lan@@ ger has been promoting young talents . &quot;
&quot; and so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros . &quot;
&quot; with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ time U.S. master winner was added to the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports &quot; on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; the results are the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the F@@ echter Corn@@ elia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the rider Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ ously the Hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich . &quot;
many of these sports@@ men came to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company moved to the Spring@@ sta@@ dion where the Lav@@ azza prize went . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the big animals .
Clinton &apos;s and Tru@@ mp@@ s economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
both Clinton and Tru@@ mp want to invest in infrastructure and prevent T@@ TP trading agreements .
&quot; however , the two US presidential cont@@ est@@ ants are un@@ equal in tax and energy policy , as well as in a fundamental issue . &quot;
&quot; the difference in economic policy between Donald Tru@@ mp and H@@ illary Clinton is a fundamental , rather philosophical distinction . &quot;
of the role of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp wants to keep this in doubt rather small and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations . &quot;
&quot; Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death , he says . &quot;
&quot; he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , says Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; he will massi@@ vely go back on regulation , and he is committed to a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and businesses . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , says : the state has to fulfil certain tasks , it has opportunities to open dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , taxes would be increased for the rich , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the subject of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in the future , Tru@@ mp and Clinton say almost word @-@ like . &quot;
the democratic candidate states the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical Te@@ apart@@ y wing of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
&quot; so , on Tru@@ mp , there could still be party @-@ internal discussions . &quot;
the differences in energy and climate policy are more clearly evident .
Tru@@ mp intends to build coal @-@ fired power plants and re @-@ establish coal mining in the United States .
&quot; oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas , and he wants to cancel the Paris Climate Protection Agreement . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , wants to explicitly expand the renewable energy with its investment programme : &quot; &quot; a country will create the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be . &quot;
&quot; but not only in infrastructure , but also in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other . &quot;
&quot; T@@ PP , the transp@@ ir@@ atory trade agreement , both do not want to sign . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both of them don &apos;t want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - they just want to protect American jobs better . &quot;
&quot; they should be paid better , Clinton says . &quot;
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a famine .
he wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; what Tru@@ mp wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must rise , then he says he must not be changed . &quot;
but the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
&quot; on the one hand , Tru@@ mp , who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth . &quot;
&quot; his critics inform him , that the budget deficit would only be greater . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand Clinton , who wants at least from the rich wants to pay more taxes , and whose critics say : more taxes are not the solution either . &quot;
flight : &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
&quot; sexual violence is a part of women who are fle@@ eing alone , almost to everyday life . &quot;
&quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed . &quot;
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen four women sit .
each one has a baby at the most one year old .
one has put her little son in his arms .
he looks curi@@ ously in the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es on the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is being watched .
she sm@@ iles and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
talking to Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; she is the Business Manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a sponsor for social welfare services in Bavaria , and deals with the issue of women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are f@@ owl .
they live in the north of Munich in one of the few de@@ centralized shel@@ ters for all @-@ forced women and their children in Bavaria .
&quot; in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs opened the institution together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Women &apos;s Aid . &quot;
&quot; recently , it was officially opened . &quot;
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - not as a visitor either .
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has experiences with sexual violence on her flight , &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men are fle@@ eing because of wars because they are persecuted politically , because they thre@@ aten to torture or death , or because their families send them to Europe as a ray of hope , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; women out@@ weigh other reasons for the escape : &quot; &quot; many steal away secretly because they see no other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their home country they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , fre@@ es , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
this is what drives them away .
&quot; on the run , this goes on . &quot;
&quot; the fact that tu@@ gs are demanding a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a r@@ arity , &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families . &quot;
&quot; who believes that the end , as soon as they anchor in Germany , mis@@ ses , tells B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; here too , single women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be considered inferior and ab@@ used in the worst case . &quot;
&quot; this means that about 90 percent of women living in the north of Munich are trau@@ mati@@ zed , they appreciate . &quot;
&quot; some of the children are certainly not born voluntarily . &quot;
many women are so used to say nothing .
&quot; or they don &apos;t dare to talk openly about the experience , because shame is too big . &quot;
&quot; since they often don &apos;t know how to help , they need more accommodations just for them , demands B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the housing of refugees . &quot;
&quot; on the question of whether they knew about a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction , some answers with no . &quot;
&quot; in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia , for example , there is no such thing in the housing of governments . &quot;
&quot; in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , hat@@ ched women are not accommodated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Middle Fran@@ con@@ ia there are floors or own houses only for single women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women . &quot;
the committee &quot; Rights of Women and Gender Equality &quot; in the European Parliament also calls for women to be separated from men .
&quot; in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are hosted separately . &quot;
&quot; if privacy is missing or men and women are accommodated together , it can lead to - continuous - violence against women . &quot;
&quot; above all , the wash@@ rooms should be easily accessible and accessible for women , is included in the study . &quot;
&quot; how much the women feel this need of protection can be read at the crowd , whom it gives to the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since we have talked about it , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
you could easily make a second home .
assistance doctors : demands for new employment campaigns
representatives of the assistance doctors have called up their union to appro@@ ve new employment campaigns in their disputes with regard to a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more work campaigns from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that ministers had agreed to deal with the concerns about the treaty .
&quot; in July , assistance specialists and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract signed with the BM@@ A . &quot;
it was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government had &quot; persist@@ ently quiet &quot; problems , which led to the rejection of the treaty . &quot;
&quot; she said : &quot; &quot; in view of this , the J@@ DC Board has agreed to completely reject the proposed new treaty and call for official re @-@ negotiations for all your concerns . &quot;
&quot; in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board today submitted a formal application to a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council in order to appro@@ ve a running program of escal@@ ating work campaigns that begins at the beginning of September . &quot;
&quot; the disputes caused assistance doctors to strike six times this year , the first total failures in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
the director of the BM@@ A resident doctor Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana res@@ igned after the election to reject the agreed contract conditions recommended by the BM@@ A .
&quot; he shared BM@@ A members during the sessions which took place before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 resident doctors and medical students , with that the contract should be beneficial and accepted . &quot;
&quot; after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the contract for doctors in England was compulsory . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
&quot; the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands , and to proclaim an official end of the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions . &quot;
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterpart in the gold @-@ plated hall of the St. Petersburg palace , I cannot for@@ f@@ eit the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation . &quot;
&quot; there was a hand@@ shake , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin sm@@ iles sm@@ iles and he barely sh@@ one warmth , even for his restra@@ ined relations . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , spoke repeatedly of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
&quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve . &quot;
&quot; the next day , a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan would have beha@@ ved as if nothing bad happened . &quot;
&quot; to me , his enthusiasm seemed rather to suggest the opposite . &quot;
&quot; but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ating , sustainable cool@@ ness revealed that Russia &apos;s head of state had forgotten nothing . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words : the shooting of a Russian fighter jet on the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction to that time has been kind@@ led .
Putin den@@ ounced and accused Ankara that Russia had fallen into the back .
&quot; going on was even bigger , as it was done by a supposed friend . &quot;
to rebuild the ve@@ to becomes difficult if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months , the state controlled media led a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
at one time it seemed as if the Turks would blame for everything .
&quot; most serious were the accus@@ ations of senior officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in Syria areas , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he has denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
&quot; but in St.@@ Petersburg , the official message was that it was time to look forward . &quot;
&quot; finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the ap@@ ology from President Erdo@@ gan , which he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia could reserve a kind of victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the advantages of a cease @-@ fire lie clearly on the hand . &quot;
Erdo@@ gan primarily needs all the friends he can get after he has been reli@@ eved of his ministry last month at a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sha@@ ken it .
but there are also economic motives .
&quot; Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular , the prohibition of charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year . &quot;
the number declined by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , travel agents and charter companies will be facilit@@ ated when the flights are resum@@ ed . &quot;
they count on a late @-@ season rush to the Mediterranean .
&quot; this week , the state television forecast cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are again allowed . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti formulated it as follows : &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
&quot; Ankara is angry with the West , as it responds to the attempted power takeover as a weak response . &quot;
&quot; to this end , the continued gru@@ dge on the slu@@ g of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is keen to benefit from the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West . &quot;
&quot; in Ankara , the Russian head of state won a bonus in Ankara that after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat he called for support for the elected state organs . &quot;
&quot; for Moscow , this is a matter of course for Moscow , which itself has a deep @-@ seated fear of regime change . &quot;
&quot; the summit in this gl@@ it@@ tering palace at the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to portra@@ y an &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; as an analy@@ st once described : two countries , who viol@@ ate the West and feel badly treated and are now f@@ ading . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the public aton@@ ement , there are still great differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave up its role as a peac@@ em@@ aker , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides . &quot;
&quot; it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents met at the press conference saying that they had not even stri@@ pped the subject . &quot;
&quot; the President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences , while Putin chose to emphasize this . &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in the face of the potential for a complete disaster , when NATO member Turkey ab@@ u@@ ded the Russian combat jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state talk at least once more . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
&quot; according to the Bank &apos;s Chief Executive Officer , the R@@ BS brand will only be reduced to a back office role . &quot;
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan announced the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was linked to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
&quot; since then , the bank has dist@@ anced itself from being nearly collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago . &quot;
&quot; during this time , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other end @-@ consumer brands . &quot;
&quot; she supported international sport with millions of pounds of sponsorship , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray . &quot;
but now it has decided to put more national marks into focus .
&quot; the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; in England and Wales all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centralised headquarters and the stock exchange on Nat@@ al will change . &quot;
the brand Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are other , smaller brands for private customer business that will get more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dru@@ m@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a viewing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the brand RS@@ B will become our Invest@@ ors brand and the brand under which our employees will be employed as we now become more of a bank of brands .
&quot; when the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand . &quot;
&quot; I say now that we do not pursue global goals , but local goals . &quot;
each of these brands will stand in their own congregations for something completely different and our employees will work with the customers among these brands .
&quot; R@@ BS has already said that it will not continue its Six Nations sponsorship , and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the different brands in its sports sponsorship . &quot;
&quot; it is time for us to develop into the bank of the brands , as how do we focus within ( we have asked ourselves ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the Chairman of the Board . &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these brands .
&quot; but with our work , focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can launch these stamps again , so I think that the time has come . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reaches his 3.@@ 000@@ th gain at New@@ market in Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
&quot; D@@ ett@@ ori sparkling champagne after a double at New@@ market , which brings him 3,000 prize &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3.@@ 000@@ th British profit at New@@ market . &quot;
&quot; he set a milestone in Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction , which is trained by John Gos@@ den on his local rac@@ et@@ rack with his second win of the night . &quot;
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey , who reached the milestone in the flat race . &quot;
&quot; he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; the triple winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who won the show at G@@ ha@@ yy@@ ar , said : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
&quot; it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday night with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very humble .
D@@ ett@@ ori picks up the che@@ er when he gets the victory on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
&quot; two jo@@ ck@@ eys have reached the milestone in the obstacle course - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved over 4,@@ 300 victories in a record breaking career . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ b@@ ysi@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 careers &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of modern@@ ity and it is no surprise that he reached this milestone that only a few have reached before him .
&quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intel@@ lect that differenti@@ ates him from the others in the weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charism@@ a thrilled fans for years for this kind of sport . &quot;
&quot; I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som , that he had already clin@@ ched 6.000 gains if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey ! &quot;
Frank@@ ie has already hit the UK for almost 30 years .
&quot; he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ mount , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the fi@@ gu@@ re@@ head of the British flat race for two decades . &quot;
it was nerve @-@ writing .
&quot; a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; 1996 at As@@ cot , but he also survived a crash crash and got a drug prohibition . &quot;
&quot; three years ago , he had difficulties when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to def@@ y his doub@@ ters and to return to his best form . &quot;
and he is not yet at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue with competitions up to his at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years of age .
Russian Putin fires Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has un@@ expect@@ edly dismissed Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov &apos;s chief of staff .
&quot; for many years , IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of Putin &apos;s closest circle of trust . &quot;
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed special representative for environmental and transport matters .
&quot; in a statement by the Krem@@ lin , it is said that without stating reasons , Putin ordered the release of Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been a representative since 2012 , was appointed to his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; born in Tall@@ inn in the Est@@ onian capital in 1972 , he graduated from the renowned State Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , it is called ( in Russian ) that he later was the chief of the cler@@ ks and staff of the government . &quot;
he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot;
I think it &apos;s the most important task of the government to support your work as head of state in respect of bills and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and recommend V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
do the smiling faces convince ?
this step has made Moscow more mysterious .
&quot; Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov had long been one of Vladimir Putin &apos;s closest confi@@ d@@ ants and works as he did for the Soviet intelligence service , the K@@ GB . &quot;
&quot; as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff reti@@ re at his own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the ridi@@ cu@@ le for the cameras , only a few of them are convinced - especially now , shortly before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
so is the consequence of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at all .
but the official statement - that a man who once was once tou@@ ted as a potential president should once again lead the Russian environmental policy - met with great scep@@ ticism .
&quot; in his remarks to Putin , quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said : &quot; &quot; it is true that I asked you at the beginning of 2012 in a conversation to give me this very complicated post - you could almost say - compla@@ ining for four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months . &quot;
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V accepted the post in December 2011 .
previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and how Putin was a former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy . &quot;
&quot; when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he trusted the most . &quot;
&quot; it was once believed that after Putin &apos;s second term , Ivan@@ ov could become president of Russia since a third term of Putin had viol@@ ated the constitution . &quot;
&quot; but this post was taken by another close allies &apos; coup , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot;
Putin became Prime Minister before he became President three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son participated in a physical examination at the set of the Los Angeles series last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios which produce the series announced in a joint statement its termination .
&quot; Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , ap@@ ologi@@ zed on Thursday before the announcement of his termination . &quot;
on the set it came to artistic differences and a dis@@ agreement .
&quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot;
&quot; details of how the character Gib@@ sons from the series , which follows a team of F@@ BI agents , will be published at a later date according to the opinion of ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios . &quot;

puzzles for fish that landed in garden in Ban@@ ff
a resident of Ban@@ ff called for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
&quot; Kevin B@@ ain thinks it could be a sand ale in the 75 fishes , which were sp@@ out by a fountain . &quot;
&quot; Mr B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published on Per@@ is@@ cope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish . &quot;
Que@@ ens@@ ferry Crossing : bridge Connec@@ ted with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the northern deck of the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings with the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four se@@ al@@ ings of the &quot; &quot; Deck blo@@ wers &quot; , &quot; approaching completion around each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons . &quot;
&quot; it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 hel@@ ical ropes . &quot;
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017 .
Minister Keith Brown made a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country .
he said : &quot; this is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings .
&quot; we are all witness to engineering from a truly epic scale in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a tricky activity requiring extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit . &quot;
&quot; in total , almost 79 % of the total bridge deck is placed in its place and the last section of the deck today gets a concrete ju@@ g@@ gling for the deck , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , Project Manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tor said : &quot; the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot;
&quot; with this fantastic project , the fast@@ ener represents forward @-@ looking construction and civil engineering . &quot;
&quot; after installing the last road cover section and its connection to the existing north tur@@ ret deck , we had to close the existing gap on the north or the shore . &quot;
this was achieved by pulling the northern allocation bridge 700 millimeters to the south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
&quot; massive since the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 2@@ 22 metres long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards on a slope of approx . 3 % . &quot;
&quot; un@@ cle , because the toler@@ ances on which the team were working were tiny - on each side they entered only a few milli@@ metres . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , everything went very well . &quot;
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men are lucky enough to be alive
three men have &quot; lucky enough to be alive &quot; after having been thrown by their fishing boat in front of Angl@@ es@@ ey .
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station struck alarm on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alarm after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
&quot; the three men had difficulty swimming in safety , while their boat moved on their own strength . &quot;
&quot; we saw the boat turned around and introduced us the worst , &quot; said the director of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds have already blown the boat out of their reach until we left water , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found hanging on a bu@@ o@@ y without a life@@ jacket . &quot;
they all came aboard the Co@@ ast@@ al rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station .
&quot; Mr Jones said , &quot; &quot; The three men who were thrown into the water are lucky and still alive . &quot;
&quot; the boot engine had an emergency stop , but the boat was loos@@ ened by the person who ste@@ ered the boat . &quot;
&quot; today , someone has watched over these men . &quot;
heavily hurt - man sticks to his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and badly injured .
&quot; as the police announced yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had received the key to the apartment in order to get his personal bel@@ ong@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; instead , the alco@@ ho@@ lics cut off the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; when she came into the apartment , he stab@@ bed her twice . &quot;
the 44 year old was injured by the hand and on the body .
the police could arrest the perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend , he called his mother . &quot;
she then al@@ er@@ ted his sister .
&quot; together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother . &quot;
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
that is why she went out of the house with her partner .
on the street they met the man &apos;s ex @-@ wife .
&quot; when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
who builds cheap apartments in Braunschweig ?
&quot; in the future , the SPD and Gre@@ ens are saying : investors should be much more involved in the future . &quot;
how do we react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 homes in the coming years ?
&quot; at the next meeting , the SPD proposes a &quot; &quot; concept of action for housing &quot; . &quot; &quot;
but dispute is programmed .
&quot; first of all , it &apos;s about the question : who should build the cheap apartments ? &quot;
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; said S &amp; D Group president Christoph Brat@@ man : &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : those who want to build on urban areas will have to show 20 percent of all apartments as social housing in the future . &quot;
&quot; however , the cheap apartments can also be produced in the inventory . &quot;
&quot; however , the big dispute in the town hall is , &quot; said Brat@@ man : &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas , but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot;
&quot; a new urban housing development program , which will cost millions and still has to be financed , should provide incentives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , as Brat@@ man said : &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot;
the CD@@ U would like to make investor as few regulations as possible .
the left wants even tough@@ er conditions for investors .
&quot; despite this , so viol@@ a , there is a tigh@@ tening of the situation on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; if the concept of action is implemented , it will take care of additional tasks in the building management . &quot;
more staff is required .
it is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers .
&quot; but the programme is not yet complete : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot;
&quot; but how do you reconci@@ le the loss of additional 1,@@ 300 cheap apartments , whose funding will exp@@ ire in the next few years ? &quot;
&quot; by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments . &quot;
&quot; to prevent this , such as the planned female spokes@@ woman Nicole Palm , should now be bought out bonds from the city . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would have to be thought about bringing apartments back into price binding . &quot;
this is possible in the west city .
at one stroke the problem could be solved .
&quot; for in the west city , at the end of the year , Fri@@ sts are running . &quot;
around 1800 apartments you could get back to the price binding for cheap apartments .
&quot; only : this does not want the owners , the housing corporations . &quot;
&quot; because the number of social housing in the West Bank is increased dr@@ astically , one is removed from the target of the so @-@ called mix . &quot;
there should be no more concentration of social weak in just a few parts of the city .
the Gre@@ ens expect there will still be movement in the discussion .
&quot; group leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must go into the boat . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I have concentrated on more building sites for single family homes . &quot;
but what does not mean is that a compromise can not yet be found .
&quot; Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it &quot;
it is fascinating to see how the world changes .
&quot; teenagers and children can no longer go outside , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time star@@ ing on screens , was compla@@ ined by many in the last decade . &quot;
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
&quot; the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then on video games and last on smartphones . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive . &quot;
&quot; of course , I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characters that were initially created for the video games in the 1990s ( later it created a animation series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) . &quot;
&quot; like many pop culture phenomena , the interest in the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand fell slightly at the beginning of July . &quot;
market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed due to the massive demand that over@@ loaded the servers .
&quot; within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter . &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , players go outside with their smartphones outside and search for Pok@@ é@@ mon , which can be tra@@ cked with a GPS and , once they have been found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the track and jumped for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the USA , the game resulted in a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person puts back every day . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ di@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , followed by 35@@ ,000 users recently announced that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of tra@@ cked people who train every day 30 minutes jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees the raw data for the increase in performance .
&quot; many public awareness campaigns on health which people want to take &quot; &quot; take 30 minutes &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; get out of the sofa &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; be active every day &quot; &quot; on deaf ears , because many public messages about health are boring and come from people who look mis@@ erable . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ rated . &quot;
those who regularly exercise sports will reduce their chances of suffering from cancer or depression .
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to lead them here . &quot;
but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
&quot; thus three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine and fun . &quot;
some people even close friends on hunting .
&quot; as always , there are also fri@@ vol@@ ous gam@@ bl@@ ers who always have to complain about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could run against a door . &quot;
what should it be ?
a breakthrough happened .
&quot; even if Smartphone @-@ Apps like Fit@@ bit could track our activity earlier , they did not give us any reason to do sports as it does this game . &quot;
the new will lose its appeal and the use will fade with time .
&quot; but because of Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the active ones in the real world and help many people hunt , more active , f@@ itter and healthier . &quot;

Sim@@ one Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Sim@@ one Bil@@ es is immune to all this .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
definitely brilliant .
and now finally Olympic Champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast kl@@ om@@ m became a multi @-@ champion title on Thursday and enlarged the gap between herself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the head@@ light of the Olympic Games .
her overall score of 6@@ 2.@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly before the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team cam@@ er@@ adi@@ n A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze med@@ alist Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina .
&quot; the American female Sim@@ one Bil@@ es Tur@@ ns on the Swedish beam during the single combat training of women in the gymn@@ as@@ tics during the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osexual American woman who wins a multi @-@ campaign title , and a total of the fifth while she consoli@@ dates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all . &quot;
she burst into tears as her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment came to an end .
&quot; this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes , such as Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights : &quot;
&quot; the last three years have dominated their sport , 15 world medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision , that the Olympic Champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u b@@ ail@@ on told her that she is the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
&quot; she expected her last examination in Brazil , a competition not so much going between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be considered disappointment . &quot;
&quot; the American female Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after they have won gold and silver in the single combat in@@ ale of women at the Olympic Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday , while she retired at the farewell party of retired man coordinator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i as ex@@ clamation mark . &quot;
&quot; although Bil@@ ly insi@@ sted on having never planned the future during their long journey , this is not really true . &quot;
part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is matched to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is not a coincidence .
&quot; this girl , who was adopted by her grand@@ parents as a little child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans &apos; mother during a school trip to the gymn@@ asi@@ um , was trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2013 , she has not lost any more competition competition , a winning stre@@ ak that will continue as long as Bil@@ ly wishes . &quot;
&quot; even if Mu@@ staf@@ ina was led by two turns , the picture dec@@ eased . &quot;
Swedish beams and dent@@ ur@@ ns - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title - l@@ ur@@ king .
&quot; she got back with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the floating beam again - and with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground there was one . &quot;
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ man gently embra@@ ced her as she expected her En@@ der@@ g@@ b@@ nis - a pure form@@ ality - and tears flow@@ ed on fine glossy red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her book book became reality . &quot;
&quot; the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place , but the bronze medal went to Mu@@ staf@@ ina in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain , called &quot; O@@ ma , &quot; had a lead . &quot;
&quot; after her soil practi@@ sing , she cast out kis@@ ses to the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed dou@@ bt@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; as for Bil@@ es , the rapidly spreading T@@ we@@ et of 19 @-@ year @-@ olds has a whole new meaning from the beginning of this week : &quot;
police : 3 victims shot in a mass mur@@ derer when listening to music in the car
&quot; according to police reports released on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot , who died in one of Phoenix &apos;s deadly attacks since a decade , while they stopped in the car and listened to music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Rochelle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12th , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said . &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand @-@ fired fire@@ arm while standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle in the report .
&quot; the police said that the thre@@ ef@@ old murder did not seem to be the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y rob@@ ber@@ y , as the attack@@ er did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , which were owned by one of the adult victims . &quot;
Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting was temp@@ ting the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether they were associated with four previous attacks .
&quot; in total , seven people were killed in h@@ is@@ panic residential neighbor@@ hoods within four months and two others were injured . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; said Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that the suspect has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincol@@ n . &quot;
investig@@ ators refused to expose the evidence they led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
&quot; El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to their injuries and died later . &quot;
&quot; liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on the spot . &quot;
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
&quot; the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , aimed at an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the triple murder and that it was assumed that it was the work of the serial killer . &quot;
investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ age sleeves and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ ia : &quot; it will be better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ olds , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but as the least of his age @-@ mates Ed@@ mund Micro@@ cephal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to did not know during her pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; when he came home for the first time , my first thought was , I couldn &apos;t do it . &quot;
I can &apos;t do that .
I did not let go of that .
&quot; what is not right at all -- of course , one has left behind it , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
your husband Vincent and her have been told that Ed@@ mund will never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; my first answer was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot;
Ed@@ mund can walk with the help of a walking help .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor craw@@ l up to his third year of life and he still cannot speak .
but he is slowly making progress .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Ed@@ mund wrote for &quot; Please sing me something . &quot;
&quot; we teach him sign language , &quot; &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot;
but it is not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund invented some characters alone .
&quot; micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as with Ed@@ mund , as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy . &quot;
symptoms and progn@@ oses may vary greatly .
it is still too early to tell how it will affect the life of the infected people infected with Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to recalls the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I wondered what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t know .
I haven &apos;t asked for the pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time because I didn &apos;t expect it to tell me someone really .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
it will be better .
you know it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
&quot; heavy rainf@@ alls , floo@@ ding gives rise to b@@ ail@@ outs in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi &quot;
heavy rainf@@ alls and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to proclaim the emergency on Friday .
&quot; numerous rivers in the south east of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi flooded their banks and threatened with large @-@ scale floo@@ ding after extreme rainf@@ alls , the National Weather Service reported . &quot;
the governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards announced that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and are already on the move to the communities affected .
&quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Pre@@ par@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , announced that the requests for high @-@ water vehicles , boats and sand bags increased . &quot;
Ste@@ ele said that alone the community of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had requested tens of thousands of sand bags .
a flood warning system is used across wide parts in the south Lou@@ isi@@ ana until Saturday .
the weather service announced that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area .
&quot; in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama a flood warning system was deployed on Friday , while the area of Mobile continued to rain . &quot;
&quot; the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , are likely to reach record levels over the weekend . &quot;
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
&quot; he also said that a flood @-@ downward floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish poses a danger , as the floo@@ ding flows only slowly flow into Lake Mau@@ re@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w river , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi state border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 09.@@ 00 . &quot;
b@@ ail@@ out teams still plu@@ cked people from the flood waters in the Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son districts in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
&quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were rescu@@ ed by Glo@@ ster on Friday . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that the water of Be@@ aver Creek , which normally lies more than 400 feet from his house , has risen strongly over night . &quot;
he said that another son @-@ son who lives nearby would have warned him .
&quot; we woke up and the water flow@@ ed and came in , &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot;
it reached my waist .
&quot; his wife told Hans@@ ford that in the 48 years she lived there , she had never seen such a high level of the river . &quot;
Hans@@ ford said he and his family members had all disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that emergency hel@@ pers would have saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they stayed until Friday . &quot;
&quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the floo@@ ding &quot; &quot; spread quickly , &quot; &quot; as there were still heavy rainf@@ alls and that the authorities consider evacu@@ ation instructions . &quot;
&quot; according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer in the vicinity of Liv@@ ing@@ stone mel@@ ted from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain . &quot;
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the soil has been significantly out@@ weigh@@ ed by rainf@@ all since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy rainf@@ alls and street floo@@ ding caused the rescu@@ ing of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and their crew in five school districts .
the WW@@ L subsidiary of the C@@ BS reported that a co @-@ ordin@@ ator in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ ua attacked 200 flooded houses .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated in two churches that were both flooded now .
&quot; the leader of the municipality Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets , washed by the floods . &quot;
&quot; in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to accommodate the evacu@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the water begins to go back , they will be able to return to their homes , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the town of Ham@@ mond of the commune of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of streets were closed due to the floo@@ ding and sand bags were provided for the inhabitants to take part , hoping to keep the water from their houses and shops . &quot;
&quot; the last big flood we had was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum of the city administration . &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
&quot; in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the Emer@@ gency Manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of the Har@@ rison count@@ ys said that it continued ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast . &quot;
&quot; according to his data , a handful of houses on Thursday have been reported as flooded but no reported on Friday . &quot;
&quot; Keith T@@ own@@ son , Manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years . &quot;
&quot; I have seen water in places where I have never seen it before , &quot; &quot; T@@ own@@ son said , &quot; &quot; and it still comes . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; &quot; pier@@ ced by balls &quot; , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia &quot;
&quot; the police said that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child is shot . &quot;
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; the grand@@ parents stated that Brown suffered several injuries , including in the end , leg , arm and stomach , but that he was in the hospital during his transportation . &quot;
&quot; he made a lot , his small body was bul@@ lied by balls , &quot; &quot; said his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the transmitter . &quot;
I can &apos;t believe it .
the condition of the boy was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family told the transmitter that he is likely to recover again .
he should have started the first class in a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in stable condition according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
&quot; the boy was found on the front seat of a car with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is in a critical condition , shot up , reports the transmitter . &quot;
the other two victims were not in the car and the police just determined whether one of the injured men could be the perpetr@@ ators .
investig@@ ators issued C@@ BS Philadelphia that apparently there was a cross@@ fire between several arch@@ ers .
&quot; cartridge shells for assault rif@@ les , which were traced back to various assault rif@@ les , were crow@@ ding the crime scene . &quot;
it seems that this is clearly an ongoing struggle .
&quot; on the road , on both sides of the side@@ walk , were pul@@ ses . &quot;
&quot; it seems that there were several armed comb@@ at@@ ants who were involved very actively , &quot; &quot; said police inspec@@ tor Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia to the transmitter . &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles in the area .
&quot; there was no arrest and police reports , according to reports , the video surveillance video . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a cri@@ pple at the arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane . &quot;
she reco@@ vers and the police are still looking for a suspect .
&quot; why we need Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot;
this is what I present under the Women &apos;s Olympics in Tur@@ ning and that is more than a reason .
&quot; first of all , I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; and secondly : this team has three gymn@@ asts , Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , inspiring for many young girls of other skin colour . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew@@ ess , and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , who is Catholic , rounds off , makes everyone proud . &quot;
this team finally reflects the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and His@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
&quot; in the last four years , the number one among female gymn@@ asts was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American woman . &quot;
last year Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
that shows strength .
&quot; at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America . &quot;
&quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion in Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they delivered unexpected but master@@ ful gy@@ ms routines . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Sim@@ one became the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osexual American woman who won gold in an individual multi @-@ competition event for women . &quot;
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
&quot; we experience the top of this sport , but they don &apos;t look like sports classes throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all beat the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to put it into the Olympic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; , &quot; because the next Olympic team will have only four female gymn@@ asts in the team . besides , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality is such that gymn@@ as@@ tics are an expensive sport and Tur@@ ner is primarily involved in private gymn@@ as@@ tics that are maintained by parents who pay for training , furnishing , travel , clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their gymn@@ asts and families ) . &quot;
the majority of these Turn@@ stones lie in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs that can support the business .
&quot; in these clubs , the gymn@@ as@@ tics receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both trained their athletes since they started the gymn@@ as@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; we have to give the churches au@@ n countless , young girls , who are inspired by Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an affordable and easier accessible gym . &quot;
I founded my gym of 20 years .
&quot; at my events , we have offered free and affordable gymn@@ as@@ tics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youth ( especially black and h@@ is@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners . &quot;
&quot; in September , we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality gymn@@ as@@ tics that deserve the opportunity to learn and profit from this great Olympic sport . &quot;
&quot; gymn@@ as@@ tics develop strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers lifel@@ ong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success .
&quot; it is the inspiration of this team , which brings thousands of young girls to interest in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great . &quot;
&quot; it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls . &quot;
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; thank you Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by holding the Olympic team gold and thank you for being motivated by so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way of becoming healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
&quot; assistance doctors want to organise further strikes , after they rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t &apos;s proposal &quot;
&quot; the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by accepting a re@@ formed agreement with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.@@ 000 assistance doctors who voted on a vote rejected him . &quot;
&quot; in July , Hun@@ t plans to introduce the contract and said that the N@@ HS found itself in a &quot; &quot; no man country &quot; &quot; and would be harmful to any further delay for the employees and patients . &quot;
&quot; the first assistance doctors are to receive a new contract , which includes changes to night and weekend contributions , in order to improve care for un@@ scheduled times . &quot;
&quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , Chair@@ woman of the BM@@ A Committee for Regi@@ stra@@ in@@ arians reported last night in a message : &quot; &quot; assistance doctors have still serious concerns about the proposed contract , in particular that it will heat up the current crisis and will be able to treat all doctors . &quot;
&quot; in only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and time runs out . &quot;
efforts on the part of the BM@@ A to resolve disputes caused by the government on reluct@@ ance to participate and sometimes silence de@@ af@@ ening silence .
&quot; this was done by a promise made by Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t last month , that his door would always be open . &quot;
&quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now , raise awareness and address the concerns of the assistance doctors . &quot;
&quot; should he not do this , the doctors have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further work campaigns . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a postpon@@ ement of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 schedules , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved in meeting doctors on the strike chain . &quot;
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by accepting the re@@ formed agreement with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the BM@@ A aims to provide a better weekly wage for the 5@@ 4,000 resident physicians who are subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of N@@ HS employees , urged the assistance doctors to stop the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; work campaigns reach nothing of the only little but strain already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare patients , nur@@ ses and their families with only worries , need and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
&quot; in the last two months , we talked to the committee of assistance doctors and responded positively to the concerns regarding guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ings with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries . &quot;
&quot; employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important issues - such as posting , flexibility in training , additional training for those who return from a professional period , training k@@ ests , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training vac@@ ations and the gender @-@ specific pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious it was the employers , the Health Education UK and the Ministry of Health in respect of the compliance with the BM@@ A in November , February and May . &quot;
&quot; the £ 2 @-@ per day medication , which can reduce heart rate risk &quot;
thousands of heart disease patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day medication after recommended by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the coag@@ ul@@ ant medication T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
&quot; the drug is administered after a heart attack for 12 months , thereby reducing the risk of stroke or another heart attack . &quot;

the N@@ HS regulation authority has recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; some 140@@ ,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of it suffers from another heart attack or stroke . &quot;
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty substances in the ar@@ tery walls that form floor@@ ings .
&quot; if the layer breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots that clo@@ g the flow of blood to the heart and thereby causes a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; when the blood cl@@ ots dissolve , it can flow through the blood stream and clo@@ g the flow of blood to the brain , causing a stroke . &quot;
persons having a heart attack already have a higher risk to have another .
&quot; T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , manufactured by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more impro@@ b@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ ICE line plan , published today , recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Technology Assessment Center , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have considerable negative effects on a person &apos;s quality of life .
experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in reducing other heart attacks and strokes in people who already had a heart attack .
&quot; by a provisional recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it . &quot;
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
political Cor@@ rect@@ ness Culture raises election fraud in Muslim areas
former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man was removed last year on the om@@ is@@ sion of a government report for corruption from office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to the fact that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is know@@ ingly ignored as a devastating government report today revealed .
&quot; Sir Eric Pick@@ les , former cabinet member , verb@@ ally attacks the police , election observers and town halls to have ignored indications of election abuse on account of &quot; crimes against eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former Minister of Integration and Local Government , who is now an anti @-@ corruption king , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious reasons would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up shut @-@ off tapes outside of elec@@ tive cabins to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters . &quot;
he recommends that voters should carry out a badge in order to prove their identity in elections .
&quot; at the moment , a vot@@ er must simply call his name and address . &quot;
&quot; the report proposes non @-@ removable ink to apply to a person &apos;s finger , when they release their votes to prevent someone from choosing twice . &quot;
&quot; whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower should receive more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
he demands that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions of non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; this serves not only against electoral fraud , but also to protect the municipal government from the broader corruption and financial crisis that goes along with it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was ordered from Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ let &apos;s election sc@@ andal in eastern London .
&quot; last year , a Special Elec@@ toral Court decided that the acting mayor Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man should be reli@@ eved after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry . &quot;
the Court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in cy@@ ni@@ cal fashion &quot; and that he would silence his critics with racism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to elect him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 votes were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of im@@ itation where one person chooses someone else .
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud throughout the country .
he expressed particularly alar@@ ming about the frau@@ dul@@ ent choice of letters - in which older members of the Muslim community had pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
&quot; Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the guiding of evidence to prove the identity &quot;
&quot; in its report , it is said : &quot; as evidence has been established that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exer@@ ted , in particular women and young people , in particular with the will of the elderly , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or criminal background . &quot;
there were concerns that ... state institutions would have know@@ ingly ignored such a behaviour due to &quot; politically correct &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion .
&quot; Sir Eric said 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition that political activists handle letter selection papers to stop &quot; re@@ aping &quot; electoral papers . &quot;
&quot; the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , also requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral list being used for immigration and social security purposes . &quot;
consider asking voters before choosing your ID .
use non @-@ removable ink on a person &apos;s finger as soon as she has released her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice .
conduct systematic reviews on the nationality of a person to ensure they are optional .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications for automatic selection of letters .
prohibition that political activists handle full post @-@ elections and envel@@ opes of local elections .
the police have the power to shut off voting stations .
a change of legislation that facilitates an accus@@ ation due to in@@ timi@@ dation in accordance with the People Act 1983 ( Legisl@@ ative Act 1983 ) .
photograph@@ ing in poll@@ ing stations .
requirement that only English may be used in the voting stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training in order to ensure that the employees generally enforce that voters go into the election cabin alone .
Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ let case there was no criminal complaint .
&quot; the electoral court has declared Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; due to a number of reasons , he was found guilty on a number of reasons - according to the high requirements of the criminal proceedings . &quot;
&quot; he also critic@@ ises the effective &quot; &quot; check@@ points &quot; &quot; of the election registration departments of the town halls . &quot;
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court ruling in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal .
&quot; our country bears a proud legacy as the Mother of Par@@ liam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of election fraud and denial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot;
crazy about K@@ ate Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger and other famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger of Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio are advised by the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ PRE@@ VO@@ T who has proved to be an impressive Doppel@@ gän@@ ger of the Herz@@ og@@ in of Cambridge .
&quot; but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympics is far from the only one fighting gold fighting ath@@ lete , who has his own famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger - at least not if one is allowed to give faith to the social media . &quot;
&quot; in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that fli@@ cker at the time on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympic Games that have more than just a certain simil@@ arity to Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; the hunter and the wolf : team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared since his childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio &quot;
&quot; besides K@@ ates Doppel@@ gän@@ ger on the race track , many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher of the twin from A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio could be . &quot;
&quot; the team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison caused a storm on Twitter after pictures , on which he secretly resembles the wolf of Wall Street Star , appeared . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he has already heard since his childhood that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I myself do not see any great simil@@ arity with the exception of the facial hair , &quot; &quot; said Bra@@ dy of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a good looking guy , so I &apos;ll take it as a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina with her big expressive eyes is supposed to be a Doppel@@ gän@@ ger for the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
&quot; and in the swimming pool , the South African swi@@ mmer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared to G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years . &quot;
one step higher : this user believes that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption Theater
&quot; another prolonged comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similarly heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips . &quot;
&quot; the Russian silver medal in Yu@@ lia E@@ fi@@ mov@@ a shows more than just the tann@@ ed skin and bl@@ ond hair as the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian was att@@ ested by fans to resem@@ ble an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; strong women : soccer star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar facial shape and eyes &quot;
not the only thing : a Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the simil@@ arities
&quot; theory in space : according to this user , there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple . &quot;
a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical .
&quot; in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredible visual form and eyes . &quot;
&quot; further popular compar@@ isons covered Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney and the gold medal winner in Tur@@ ning Gab@@ by Douglas , who has her own beautiful , wide smile , similar to that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union . &quot;
C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games ap@@ olog@@ ises for his statement that Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers &quot; died &quot; like a pig

&quot; Canadian broad@@ caster C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese swi@@ mmer &quot; &quot; like M@@ ief &quot; &quot; and during the race , like &quot; &quot; a pig died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the comment@@ ator B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was off when he was leaving his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m .
&quot; Mac@@ Donald who had been picked up in the commentary team of the C@@ BS to give more &quot; colour &quot; could be said , &quot; This little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the union , baby . &quot;
&quot; too excited , went down like M@@ ief , died like a pig . &quot;
thanks for that .
&quot; the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the swimming pool 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which enabled the Canadian to close the gap to China . &quot;
viewers in all of Canada quickly re@@ acted online after they were shocked by the sound and the language
&quot; Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; &quot; Di@@ d the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old swi@@ mmer from China &quot; &quot; like a pig died &quot; &quot; ? ? ? ? ? &quot;
the I@@ di@@ ot didn &apos;t get that they were still on stream .
&quot; Ai Yan@@ han from China was described in the final 4 x 200m Fre@@ estyle swimming pool for women as follows : &quot; &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the union , baby . &quot;
the criticism against B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came fast and hard at which many were talking about it
Twitter users didn &apos;t get back when they heard how un@@ aware B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Donald was
&quot; another Twitter user in Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; &quot; wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald . &quot;
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and let us all look like ra@@ cists .
&quot; shortly afterwards Scott Russ@@ el , who hosted the C@@ BC show live for the comment of Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment about a swimming power was broad@@ cast@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wording , sorry that it happened . &quot;
&quot; in the end , C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed for more than 90 times with the people who responded to the Not@@ ice on Twitter &quot;
the commentary colleague Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze on behalf of Mac@@ don@@ ald
C@@ BC copied and attached his ap@@ ology to more than 90 other Twitter users who compla@@ ined about the comments of Mac@@ Donald .
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and issued a message .
we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast .
&quot; yesterday night , we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our audience on broadcast and our followers in the social media . &quot;
&quot; to clarify one , B@@ yr@@ on &apos;s comments related to the performance of the float and not on them as a person . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate wording . B@@ yr@@ on does what he said , very sorry . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ Donald ap@@ ologi@@ zed and tried to justify his remark , saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack . &quot;
&quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the women &apos;s swimming pool in the C@@ BC Olymp@@ ian turn , he said . &quot;
&quot; I was referring to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers , not to them as a person . &quot;
&quot; of course , there was no dis@@ regard intended and I am very sorry . &quot;
buyers in Pri@@ mark ou@@ tra@@ ged by woman who sham@@ elessly tried under@@ wear in the middle of the business
the buyers did not know where to go when a woman took her clothes in the middle of a mark to try under@@ pants .
&quot; to wor@@ sen the situation , she looked like she looked at it , pulled her out and put them back into the shelf again . &quot;
she continued to browse and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
&quot; the primary business in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , where the woman tried the under@@ pants before she put them back into the shelf &quot;
&quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in store at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear she went back and left the shop without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; People could not believe what they saw . &quot;
&quot; standing in the middle of the sales floor she took a pair of under@@ pants from the delivery , drew her own ti@@ ghts and pants and tried them . &quot;
&quot; she didn &apos;t even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; everyone star@@ ed when she pulled out the under@@ pants that you obviously didn &apos;t like , as she put them on the shelf again . &quot;
she repeated the same thing with three other under@@ pants before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like anything and went out and went out .
&quot; she did not seem to distur@@ b anyone , or to think about the person who would possibly buy the under@@ pants she had tried . &quot;
&quot; Davi@@ dson , 33 who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; how to think that someone would take home who had a different person and who were not washed . &quot;
the incident happened on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; as I have seen , the employees tried to pull out the clothes from selling after they went - which is just as good . &quot;
I would hate to go home with a new couple of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had her and went out and did not wash them .
&quot; a spokes@@ man for Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday August 9 at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot;
all products coming into question were drawn out of sale .
how to protect yourself from weapons attacks with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video by Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a little more secure . &quot;
&quot; we spoke to Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you approach you from the front or back , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ ewer to your predat@@ or . &quot;
&quot; if you approach you from behind , you should turn around as first , so that you can see your attack@@ er and &quot; go out of the line , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
then grab the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and shoulder before hitting it with your free el@@ bow .
&quot; beat him with his knee in the bar and twist the weapon out of his hands , the weapon out of his hands . hit him with the barrel and move backwards while holding the gun on him . &quot;
&quot; with attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the shot line , grab the gun and twist it so that the attack@@ er can not shoot . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , store the weight on the weapon and beat the aggres@@ sor to the chest , then twist the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and the weapon on it . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it makes Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
&quot; but remember that with a rob@@ ber@@ y , it is the saf@@ est way to over@@ pass your money - if you are not a Mag@@ a Grand@@ master . &quot;
trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right sh@@ ab@@ t his tongue for a guide to the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe
a British trav@@ eller under@@ took his immune system and stran@@ gled a serious test by li@@ cking some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
&quot; the moder@@ ator and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k took his course on a euro note , a ra@@ iling on Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a r@@ ins@@ ing button of a pull @-@ in toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system . &quot;
&quot; before removing any object , he used a lumin@@ ometer to show himself and us what he is going to do . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results . &quot;
&quot; the thought of li@@ cking the flush button of a pull @-@ in toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke to doctors and healthcare professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and their own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , nothing left what he li@@ cked , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
&quot; Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resili@@ ence of his bow@@ els by travelling through the world , and eating strange as well as wonderful things . &quot;
&quot; from public funds to railway stations to sin@@ ks of toilets , the task presented his immune system definitely under a test &quot;
&quot; in the film he said : &quot; &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot;
&quot; in the film , he was able to do justice to his reputation . &quot;
the only thing he rejected was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his sample painting showed a lumin@@ omet@@ ry of more than 4000 units .
&quot; compared to this , the lumin@@ omet@@ ry of freshly washed hands amounts to less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to lick off after their lumin@@ omet@@ ry was over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands were less than 60 &quot;
&quot; Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom . &quot;
&quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; that comes close to the worst thing I &apos;ve got in a toilet . &quot;
there is nothing more dirty than that !
I won &apos;t find anything here because it is disgu@@ sting here .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
&quot; the company provides Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support intestinal bacteria and immune system . &quot;
&quot; vali@@ os Senior Venice President for Snacks , S@@ haf@@ ts and New categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ or@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; &quot; we really wanted to offer the consumer something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explain the benefits of pro@@ biotics .
we performed crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended up saying &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking just about the products , we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system . &quot;
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film , added : &quot; &quot; let me say this - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had tasted some of the things I had told him to lick , just like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet , which is shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course , there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to lick her and others where this was quite difficult . &quot;
I &apos;m glad that we recorded some of these fil@@ thy goo@@ dies on film .
&quot; in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents reported lac@@ tic acid bacteria especially with the well @-@ being of the stomach and the intest@@ ines and 58 percent said they use at least occasionally products containing included lac@@ tic acid bacteria . &quot;
&quot; as@@ o@@ cial Family destroyed prior to Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ate social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; an as@@ o@@ cial family left their social apartment after a deletion with a loss of £ 50,000 , because they had terr@@ orized their neighbors . &quot;
&quot; T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; after they were forci@@ bly removed from their property , shocked employees of the housing association found the property in an irre@@ parable state . &quot;
&quot; the walls had cla@@ d holes , wood boards were torn up , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was s@@ me@@ ared to the walls . &quot;
the family has been reloc@@ ated and it is assumed that they are now living in a private accommodation
&quot; Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for house administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that she fears that the apartment is no longer re@@ pairing . &quot;
she said : &quot; it was an absolute night@@ mare for the people here and I think that people do not have to live in this way .
there are many things to consider as this property is probably considered not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is also .
&quot; the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inflic@@ ted was street fights with bas@@ eball bat , in@@ timi@@ dation of residents , drug abuse , drug trafficking , and excessive scre@@ ams , stri@@ des and floods . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ by , 47 , whose name was on the lease , received an order for anti @-@ social behaviour in June . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which is torn down under certain circumstances , old tr@@ ash was found &quot;
&quot; in the estate where drugs were traded in the past , the wood boards were torn up &quot;
&quot; neighbours said that they saw them fighting on the street , and regularly called the police to be inv@@ oked . &quot;
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing and her partner forci@@ bly removed from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ans were che@@ ered by facilit@@ ated neighbours who said that their lives were made to hell .
&quot; one said , &quot; They were not compla@@ ining about anyone . &quot;
we lived 20 years apart from them and it was always bad .
the countless times we tell the police here are incredible .
&quot; this morning we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to that !
&quot; now that they are finally gone , it will be nice . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it would have administered the family to cooperate with the local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals , 20 years long . &quot;
rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys were thrown down on the crowded side of the community house
&quot; he added : &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant ad@@ mits to accept any responsibility for their behavior and their family since a deletion is always the last step , considering Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot;
&quot; this was a very difficult case , because the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be terrible . &quot;
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community who have cour@@ age@@ ously approached us and have given us the information provided . &quot;
I hope that this development will don@@ ate con@@ sol@@ ation to some neighbours and the message conveyed that anti @-@ social behaviour is not tolerated .
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 . &quot;
&quot; a dirty mattress , which is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house following the deletion on the floor . &quot;
workers of the house administration will now have to clean garbage mountains that surround the house
&quot; in 2014 , the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g of cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ by was awarded a fine , after having found herself guilty of the possession of a class B drug in commercial custody . &quot;
she claimed that the money for a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee Skel@@ don was born in 2013 in a car accident .
&quot; after being homeless , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many walls of the house were covered with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
police say they will deleg@@ ate rent@@ ers who do not stick to the house rules
Angela C@@ row of the Police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall told that the Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ans were a clear warning to the other tenants who did not stick to the house rules .
&quot; this goes to those who think that they can act without blame , as well as those who have been har@@ med by such behaviour , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal set in panic after a flying military jet is flying over
&quot; solar an@@ bet@@ ans in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives &quot;
a Portuguese P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane of the air forces put an incredible crash
&quot; the air forces indicated that it was on a training flight , but insi@@ sted that there was no risk of safety &quot;
this was the moment when sc@@ ared tourists started to panic after a flying jet crashing over a full beach .
dramatic video recordings showed how the military aircraft flew close to the beach in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
&quot; the vac@@ ation@@ ers jumped up when they understand@@ ably began to worry about the noise of the nozzle drives , without first seeing what came to them through the clouds . &quot;
&quot; the incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers who posted videos about the dramatic fly @-@ by in social media , said : &quot; &quot; it flew very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane would fall on me . &quot;
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro were in panic when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep .
&quot; the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast , while flying so deep that this was the only way to see it . &quot;
&quot; the speaker said that due to bad visibility , the jet flew a little deeper than usual , but the air force insi@@ sted that safety at no time was at risk . &quot;
&quot; area fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , where four people came to death on the island of Madeira . &quot;
&quot; today , the Portuguese air forces announced that the pilot had to fly so low due to the conditions - heavy fog and fire smoke - which limits his vision . &quot;
the plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise

Sev@@ ille - FC Barcelona fights for the first step in the new football season on Sunday .
&quot; the Catal@@ ans compete in the du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup towards the FC Sevilla , the back@@ lash three days later at Camp No@@ u . &quot;
&quot; the Dou@@ ble@@ W@@ inner must ab@@ stain from competing with the defeated and ruling Europe league champion , among others on N@@ ey@@ mar , who cont@@ ests with Brazil the Olympic football tournament . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Go@@ alie also lacks Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter St@@ egen . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the training , the German suffered a lig@@ ament in the knee , which clari@@ fied the demand at Bar@@ ca at least initially in favor of Claudio Bra@@ vo . &quot;
the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen in Barcelona have been competing for the status as number one for two years .
&quot; coach Luis En@@ rique gave up a clear decision so far , leaving Bra@@ vo in the league , but T@@ er St@@ egen in the majority of the other cont@@ ests succeeded . &quot;
&quot; before the first mandatory game of the new season , the Spanish Master doubts about the fitness condition of the crew , who was humili@@ ated at a test play of Liverpool at 0 : 4 on Saturday . &quot;
even at 3 : 2 at the pro@@ s@@ ling op@@ p against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. didn &apos;t really know how to convince .
Sev@@ ille again has to di@@ gest the 2 : 3 defeat in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and stri@@ ves for the second triumph at the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; with so far eleven successes , Barcelona is the record winner in this review . &quot;
Ma Long in its own league table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis tournament winner .
&quot; the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his country@@ man and &quot; &quot; defending champion &quot; &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5.@@ 4.4 ) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; the world rank@@ ings hit the &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; with successes at World Cup , World Cup , World @-@ Tour Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and just Olympia . &quot;
bronze went to the Japanese Ju@@ n Mi@@ th@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it as expected in the final game and made themselves the title among themselves .
&quot; it was clear that for the third time in a row , a Chinese would pick up the single title in the sign of the Five rings . &quot;
last non @-@ Chinese on the top Olympics bar@@ gain was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Legi@@ on@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
&quot; Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between the sentences and in time @-@ outs , they had no c@@ aches . &quot;
they had pulled back on the tri@@ b@@ une and left their cont@@ ests alone in a fair competition alone .
&quot; the Mat@@ ches up to this point I played for my country . &quot;
&quot; in the final I play for myself , &quot; Z@@ hang had said fol@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; after the game , gold and silver med@@ alli@@ ons pos@@ ing with the China flag . &quot;
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly un@@ il@@ ater@@ al .
Ma had only really to fight with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first movement .
&quot; after that , he set the tempo on the board and left Z@@ hang from there only a total of 13 points . &quot;
&quot; due to the superi@@ ority of Ma , it was not the expected sweeping match . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , nevertheless , there were enough breathtaking b@@ ale changes to be seen . &quot;
Mi@@ th@@ ani won the match for the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
&quot; in the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an had contracted a rib@@ bed injury after that , after that , he had to settle with tin . &quot;

Donald Tru@@ mp awarded ″ huge problems ″ in the election campaign
the leadership of the US Repub@@ lic@@ ans is pla@@ gu@@ ed by massive concerns even in traditional conservative federal states to lose their majority .
presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp has now short@@ com@@ ings of his election campaign in the former Republi@@ can strongh@@ old U@@ tah .
&quot; a rare moment in which the multi @-@ lane and self @-@ confident Mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aire expressed as little concern as concerns , as correspon@@ dents reported . &quot;
&quot; after he threw 16 ri@@ vals inside his own republi@@ can camp , doubts about his success in the struggle for the White House are growing . &quot;
&quot; we have tremendous problems in U@@ tah , &quot; said Tru@@ mp in front of evangel@@ ical Christians who asked for assistance in important states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; if false reports on his can@@ did@@ acy were guilty , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media . &quot;
Republi@@ can strongh@@ olds w@@ ack@@ y
U@@ tah is usually a secure bank for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
&quot; according to a survey by Surv@@ ey@@ US from June , Tru@@ mp and his competitor of the democr@@ ats , H@@ illary Clinton , lay at the same level . &quot;
&quot; other institutes see Tru@@ mp in front , but not by the distance that is common for Republi@@ can candidates in the state . &quot;
Arizona and Georgia are also regarded as endangered .
&quot; in an interview by the CN@@ BC , Tru@@ mp answered the question of how he would stop the advance of Clinton : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; and if afterwards : this will either be successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot;
he is doing nothing else than &quot; telling the truth . &quot;
&quot; if it is not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , this is fine , said Tru@@ mp . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to press reports , the party Tru@@ mp is reported to have threatened to strike funds to support his election campaign , he should not present any better survey values . &quot;
&quot; instead , the Repub@@ lic@@ ans of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans want to get stronger under the arms of the Congress . &quot;
Olympics : three @-@ star fraud in dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary commission .
&quot; after the second dop@@ ing affair , Kenya &apos;s athletes face the challenge of the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; after an attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic Village , Kenya sent a coach home . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee immediately announced the establishment of a disciplinary commission to investigate the case .
&quot; a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary had announced that the former S@@ printer and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , had given a urine sample in the Olympic village under the name of the 800 @-@ metre runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich . &quot;
this was reported by the team leader K@@ eni@@ as of the dop@@ ing controllers .
&quot; the IA@@ AF World Association has requested the IO@@ C to obtain information about the case in order to ex@@ ert its own investigations , distributed an IA@@ AF speaker . &quot;
&quot; depending on the results of the study and the following measures of the IO@@ C , IA@@ AF will evaluate an assessment , &quot; &quot; he said in an IA@@ AF statement . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the Dop@@ ing control station and had spent himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , submitted and signed the test , &quot; explained K@@ eni@@ as chief de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot;
&quot; he was in possession of the accreditation of the ath@@ lete , who was on the list for training controls of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency . &quot;
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich was in 2015 in Beijing WM @-@ fourth more than 800 meters .
&quot; four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan athle@@ tics delegation headed Michael Rot@@ ich from Rio Games . &quot;
he is accused of inform@@ ing athletes of his country about pending dop@@ ing tests .
&quot; according to media reports , he was reported to have been arrested at his return to the Nairobi airport . &quot;
&quot; in the IO@@ C after numerous dop@@ ing off@@ ences , Kenya has been under special observation for quite some time . &quot;
&quot; during the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls in front of the Rio Games , it was previously noted that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted . &quot;
&quot; the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency had exer@@ ted a lot of pressure on the African country in front of the summer games in Brazil , to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system . &quot;
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympic debut .
&quot; as a result , the WA@@ DA Kenya decreased from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is compatible with the rules of WA@@ DA . &quot;
Kenya is regarded as a tall runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
&quot; in a series of television reports of the ARD , repro@@ aches were repeatedly raised that dop@@ ing funds are easily accessible in Kenya and there should be a considerable mentality of sports fraud . &quot;
&quot; last but not least , IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und called for a similar investigation in Kenya , as he had employed in Russian athle@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , it was possible to prove that in this sport @-@ type was surface @-@ wide and systematically sub@@ stituted . &quot;
Russia &apos;s athletes were then excluded from the summer games .
Salzburg &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
&quot; in the Shakespeare @-@ Year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic pair of love , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot;
with this a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
&quot; a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bernstein &apos;s masterpiece . &quot;
the artistic director Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled with the role of Mary a youth space .
&quot; in the orchestra pit , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he war@@ ms . &quot;
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and their melody .
it &apos;s a wonderful mixture - the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have music in our blood !
&quot; in this production , Bart@@ oli plays an older Mary . &quot;
she re@@ members with sad@@ ness of her love with Tony while the younger Mary plays and dances .
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
&quot; first , because it is musi@@ cally extraordinary ! &quot;
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and funny and bright . &quot;
&quot; so it &apos;s clever , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate . &quot;
&quot; she resembles me very much , my Italian character I have as Roman , &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist .
it is such an honour for us to work with her .
it is a tremend@@ ously generous human being .
and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
&quot; one sees it in each of his movements , in his glan@@ ces , it is his life ! &quot;
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a happy approach to life , which is very important at all ! &quot;
&quot; for American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley , the &quot; West Side Story &quot; is up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; this piece is about prejudi@@ ce and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
&quot; today we have the refugees , at that time the Pu@@ ch@@ ic@@ ans went to New York , and the New York residents did not want them . &quot;
&quot; they are the same subjects , and they are just as meaningful today as it was at that time . &quot;
&quot; 59 years later , the piece is still relevant . &quot;
London school@@ girl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
&quot; K@@ adi@@ za Sul@@ t@@ ana , one of three British school@@ girls who left London last year to join the IS , re@@ port@@ edly died in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Tas@@ ni@@ me A@@ kun@@ je@@ e said that her family experienced a few weeks ago from her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria . &quot;
&quot; it was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the bul@@ war@@ k of the group in the country , I@@ TV News reported on Thursday . &quot;
Sul@@ t@@ ana was 17 years old and died shortly after she had pre@@ destined to leave the land @-@ torn country and return to England .
&quot; one can only hope that the only good lies - as reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to stop people from ever making this decision , &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e . &quot;
&quot; in February 2015 , Sul@@ t@@ ana and two other school girls from the east of London entered an airplane in the direction of Turkey and subsequently entered a bus to the Syrian border . &quot;
&quot; Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family was told that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria , and within a few months she became a widow . &quot;
Rei@@ d says Clinton would remain as candidates for the Supreme Court in case of electoral victory at Gar@@ land
&quot; Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate the judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ lands &apos;s confirmation since his nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the dead judge at the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he would expect Clinton to select &quot; &quot; Gar@@ land &quot; &quot; with a certain degree of certainty . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d later said that he had not talked with Clinton , whether she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulated . &quot;
he praised Gar@@ land and said that Clinton &apos;s team would not care for rest@@ lessness with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the Supreme Court for the U.S. Court of Appe@@ als for the District of Columbia .
&quot; RAID said Repub@@ lic@@ ans blocked the gar@@ lands nom@@ ination , lack@@ eys and hel@@ pers of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp . &quot;
he also noted Donald Tru@@ mp was un@@ suitable for the presidential office .

the Tre@@ ats magazine co@@ operates with the photographer David Bel@@ le@@ mere in order to release a 1970s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
&quot; but instead of famous naked people , they want to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses Calendar for 2017 . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us that his nude magazin of Old@@ school Play@@ boys is different because &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot; &quot;
I do this for women .
&quot; apparently , it is the view that it does the calendar too . &quot;
&quot; we have to return to the portra@@ yal of timeless and classical nu@@ dity , in which both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release for the publication of the calendar . &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their images online or personally at open casting call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish municipality counts with mass ex@@ odus
&quot; anyone who doesn &apos;t fit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ close Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot;
&quot; in the short term , the Kurdish community of Germany expects to flee from Turkey to Germany with tens of thousands of prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; in the medium term it might even be &quot; &quot; a hundred thousand &quot; , &quot; believes the President of the Association Ali Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; due to the harsh prec@@ ep@@ ts of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term , with a few hundred thousand protection @-@ seekers from Turkey in Germany , if the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; says the President Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; from Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government had already covered Kurdish strongh@@ olds with criminal charges a few months ago , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds were fle@@ eing within Turkey . &quot;
&quot; after the depl@@ eted coup , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks were added . &quot;
many will want to restart in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state that takes up refugees themselves , produces refugees in their own country , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; the Chief of the Association lam@@ ented the specific sett@@ ling of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in Algeri@@ an towns . &quot;
&quot; thus , Erdo@@ gan wants to increase the entry pressure to the remaining Kur@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; they are the last big minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already exter@@ min@@ ated or expelled in the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot;
the Chief Prosecutor called for the German government to sit &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his supporters . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , too , there is a &quot; witch hunt &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critics . &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
&quot; more Turks are seeking asylum in Germany , above all Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists . &quot;
the fire mark as a quality trailer destro@@ ys teachers and other academ@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; he who does not fit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , inci@@ dentally also the Kem@@ alists and Sä@@ kul@@ aren , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ close Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as reported by the newspaper on the figures of the German Federal Ministry of Interior , the Turks introduced the largest group of asylum @-@ holders recognised for political persecution in Germany before the coup . &quot;
&quot; on the reporting date June 30 , this was 11.@@ 3@@ 86 people , and nearly 29 per cent of all people recognized as asylum seekers ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this survey , there is no need for war , poverty or a lack of perspective . &quot;
&quot; asylum Rights according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually persecuted . &quot;
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals don &apos;t get anything from the summer campaign with - and the holiday@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to vote the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
&quot; in 2021 , the state election will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; for it &apos;s not stupid than until now : summer holidays , heat and land elections - that bites . &quot;
&quot; the locals , who are to be convinced by the campaig@@ ners , are on vacation . &quot;
&quot; most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers who are in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , Ru@@ egen or Hid@@ den@@ see are no natives , so are not allowed to choose the Land@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; there are practical problems : during the holidays , hel@@ pers who hang up posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers , and count out voices in the end , only pain@@ stak@@ ingly pick up . &quot;
&quot; until September 4 , 2016 , the election and last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to pass the election campaign just short of the people . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , needs to fear his office . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in surveys . &quot;
&quot; exciting is how strongly newcom@@ er Af@@ D cuts off , and what remains at the end of co@@ ali@@ tion@@ space remains . &quot;
&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost in@@ conspic@@ uous election campaign , one sees from his big posters . &quot;
&quot; he travels through the country , distri@@ butes roses and ch@@ ats a little with the people , just as it did his legendary elo@@ qu@@ ent predecessor , Harald Ring@@ storff . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , Soul @-@ ering has got cold feet and gives chan@@ cell@@ or Merkel the guilt at the flowering of Af@@ D . &quot;
&quot; their refugee policy , their &quot; &quot; We create the &quot; &quot; ha@@ stens the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which is now likely to cost him the beautiful office . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U with its top candidate , the Minister of the Interior , Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is if you are at the right place in the right place at the wrong time . &quot;
she has invited German chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel to large @-@ scale r@@ allies ; Merkel &apos;s Bundestag group is in the Nor@@ theast .
&quot; but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; compla@@ ined Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , recently in the N@@ DR . &quot;
but it &apos;s not a shame to anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once .
&quot; otherwise , the Nord@@ ost @-@ CD@@ U wai@@ ves the usual campaign conditions at market places and in front of shopping m@@ alls with umbr@@ ellas and ballo@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; this , according to Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; subordin@@ ate role . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Union has also noted that , in the country , you have to cut off the base that it has to be very tough to find a wire to the people . &quot;
&quot; you are doing it like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : in the pages of the country hardly any . &quot;
&quot; the Council of the CD@@ U election champion Kok@@ ert on his comrades is also self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; &quot; they must go where it hur@@ ts , namely where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
&quot; because there is a lot on the game , Sell@@ ering has called his SPD to a particularly committed election campaign . &quot;
&quot; in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats la@@ gged on 22 percent behind the CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just under the Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot;
&quot; at the 2011 election , the SPD had yet clearly gained 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Gre@@ ens , a small party with seven percent in the surveys , are likely to make the leap into the Land@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; they make a modern virtue out of their holidays , and largely reloc@@ ate their election campaign to the internet . &quot;
&quot; the president , Claudia Müller , is calling for an online election campaign . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , green campaig@@ ners embar@@ k on a search for local vocal folds among the vac@@ ation@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , just cur@@ v@@ t with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg lakes and finds it also beautiful . &quot;
their impression : &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Rest@@ oration : restaurants suffer from blocking
&quot; the speed , with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated , is nothing to complain about . &quot;
&quot; for those responsible for the construction work , which begin at 5.@@ 30@@ am and end only at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning , there are all praise . &quot;
&quot; they have done everything quite jag@@ ged , &quot; El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff talks about the jet fuel station . &quot;
this is a super team .
there is also no delay .
&quot; at the beginning of the week , the construction site could be moved to the south as planned , until the end of October everything should be ready . &quot;
&quot; the opposite of those responsible for the construction work will also be commen@@ ded , for example when it comes to furnishing accommodation . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site has been immig@@ rated to the south on Monday and the blocking of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen has been lifted and thus the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg is back , the traffic situation within the resort has eased . &quot;
the citizens can now return from O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 on both sides .
ev@@ asive traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were some considerable complaints , &quot; says the deputy chief conductor Florian King responsible for the technical management of the refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of Bach@@ el@@ strasse , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner Street and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many sne@@ akers sought and rather trusted their Nav@@ i as the sign@@ age . &quot;
what led to the fact that some trucks were fra@@ ying in residential areas .
&quot; since the speed limits were not met , the municipality ampli@@ fied the vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen . &quot;
&quot; there were considerable transgres@@ sions , &quot; says King , who made himself informed on the spot himself . &quot;
two to three per minute have been fired .
the fastest was on the road with 77 ho@@ ur@@ ly miles in the Tempo zone .
&quot; since the construction site has been moved , however , it has become qui@@ eter . &quot;
for the business@@ men at the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg the street is now open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the maps .
&quot; but that the B 27 refurb@@ ishment has led to sales drops in them , anyone you ask will be able to look through . &quot;
&quot; however , some are more and some less affected . &quot;
&quot; for those who have less to do with the &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; , &quot; so for other companies , the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences . &quot;
&quot; in the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er , too , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; maximum moderate decline , &quot; but also ad@@ mits that of course &quot; the running search is missing . &quot;
the most heavily exploited are the spots along the road .
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly Crown , finds clear words . &quot;
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; not only him , but all the restaurants have &quot; &quot; hit hard &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil were missing . &quot;
we need to be happy about every euro turnover .
&quot; in terms of sales revenue , it affects &quot; far beyond 50 percent . &quot; &quot;
the street renovation took its operation &quot; for two years . &quot;
he had to leave half of his staff .
&quot; if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed , politics would have re@@ acted differently . &quot;
&quot; instead , President Jörg Schmidt replied to a request by G@@ öh@@ ner if there could be a financial compensation , with the hint that the inn would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the location on the B . now it must also bear the disadvantages due to the refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties where something more generous has been handled .
&quot; with all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist . &quot;
&quot; after all , the family business has been located here since 17@@ 15 and refers to the long history . &quot;
&quot; that other regular guests are now less frequent due to the complicated traffic guidance , he can understand . &quot;
&quot; if you cannot drive , it is also very different . &quot;
&quot; after the renovation work has come back , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts . &quot;
&quot; despite the crises associated with BSE and avi@@ an influenza , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the impact of B 27 works on his customers for the biggest crisis that has experienced his hom@@ etown in its long @-@ standing history . &quot;
six months of construction work is already brutal .
&quot; in the name of the fight against terrorism , it is constantly ro@@ uted by laws . &quot;
&quot; following the latest proposals , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère now presents a thick security package . &quot;
but what has a tolerance status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the ser@@ ge@@ ant .
&quot; all his proposals should be &quot; politically reasonable &quot; to the coalition partner , &quot; says the Federal Minister of Interior in the presentation of his new security package . &quot;
they demand no one .
&quot; other , further points would first be discussed within the parties . &quot;
I also took part in that .
&quot; however , as the Minister of the Interior , he was on the basis of results and in a &quot; &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; within the Coalition . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère has taken a little time before presenting its conclusions for security in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; however , these are all the more extensive . &quot;
&quot; a lot is already known , announced , announced : that a new security authority should care for the cra@@ cking of encrypted communication is not new . &quot;
&quot; also , it is not the fact that Germany needs to implement multiple EU directives on passenger data and weapons . &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is not surprising as well .
&quot; in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère starts a second attempt for proposals that have not been done with the SPD : he wants sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and push jihadi@@ sts with dual citizenship to the German passport . &quot;
&quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; says the CD@@ U . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he thinks this is reasonable and does not demand anything in the coalition partner anyway . &quot;
a few new ideas are presented de Mai@@ zi@@ ère .
they have partly in themselves : he plans quick procedures for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for det@@ ain@@ ting people from deportation .
refugees who are targeted to the country should check their smartphones and reveal social media accounts for a security check .
&quot; in the case of Dul@@ ces for rejected asylum seekers , he wants to make some worse places than previously - such as comm@@ itting criminal off@@ ences or deliberately throwing their papers away in order to disgu@@ ise their identity . &quot;
some of them are politically and legally sanc@@ tioned .
some also works un@@ expect@@ edly and leaves questions open .
&quot; and at some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of tolerated ones , the question arises : what has it to do with security and terror ? &quot;
&quot; yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between refugees and terror . &quot;
but it is not possible to say that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
&quot; in addition , many people were worried about security in the face of the high levels of refugees . &quot;
and things that people deeply concerned could not be cl@@ ung out in election times either .
the inner security is enormously concentrated in the focus .
&quot; first stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
&quot; yes , there are electoral struggles . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the Union and the SPD are increasingly in position on the subject of internal security . &quot;
&quot; in the past few days , between the two parties , it was high . &quot;
&quot; only a gar@@ ris@@ ome dispute over the Federal Police &apos;s equipment , then a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons Home Affairs Ministers , in which the resort managers also demand a ban on bur@@ ka and a return from double citizenship . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère also struggles for conci@@ li@@ atory sounds .
&quot; from a departure from the double pass , he keeps nothing . &quot;
we have concluded the discussion in Germany .
to re@@ open it does not make sense .
&quot; and with a ban on the Bur@@ ka , he has constitutional obj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; whether his own package is constitu@@ tionally un@@ constitutional and if it is &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , it must still be revealed . &quot;
there is a lot in it that could cause stri@@ fe .
but the SPD is also trying to make a profit on the subject of internal security .
&quot; party leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel first sign@@ alizes readiness for dialogue and says : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that will help to improve security . &quot;
&quot; still , Volkswagen will get off lightly . &quot;
&quot; despite diesel consumption , deliveries are rising worldwide . &quot;
but it is not running in all markets .
&quot; with the recall action , there are vor@@ ti@@ ces about a term . &quot;
Volkswagen starts the second half of the year with deliveries .
&quot; despite its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer can continue to show a plus in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ running markets . &quot;
&quot; however , in July , the core brand VW declined mainly in Western Europe and thus loaded the total sales of the company , like the company listed in the D@@ ax . &quot;
&quot; in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s level . &quot;
&quot; in the home market of Germany , deliveries dropped by almost one sixth . &quot;
&quot; market leader Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann , headed by Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann , led the weaker figures from July especially to two sales days less in Europe . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in some core markets , &quot; changed economic conditions &quot; have been given a reluct@@ ance to buy . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation relating to the attempted coup in Turkey , the British vote on the withdrawal from the EU also bur@@ dened , a spokes@@ woman explained . &quot;
&quot; in the US , where the ab@@ at@@ osphere first escal@@ ated , there is also a minus in beech . &quot;
big support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; all in all , the mainly affected house brand of the Lower Saxony is still lightly covered by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only a delivery minus of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is available . &quot;
group sales leader Fred Kap@@ pler continued to show a sales increase from January to July .
&quot; Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles this time , 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide . &quot;
Volkswagen had tam@@ pered with a software exhaust .
&quot; in Germany alone , VW brings about 2.5 million vehicles to upgrade to the workshops . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the conversion , VW re@@ affir@@ med that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after retro@@ fitting the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance . &quot;
&quot; after the conversion , the car manufacturer issued a &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; certificate , but not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was said on Friday in corporate travel . &quot;
the reason is legal sub@@ t@@ le@@ ties .
the &quot; Focus &quot; had reported that Volkswagen now offers its German customers a guarantee of environmentally friendly diesel models .
this would have confirmed the last Monday VW @-@ representative in the Federal Office of Transport .
the Ministry of Transport confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; VW has fully embra@@ ced the requirements of my Insp@@ ection Commission and the KBA . &quot;
&quot; deviations from this are not accepted , &quot; stated Federal Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has taken over the warranty that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance will not take place after the conversion and all type appro@@ vals relevant vehicle values have remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; but not as it was stated in corporate travel . &quot;
&quot; with the wide term &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; , &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that for example , half a year after the conversion , customers can come to a workshop for half a year after the conversion - and this could lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; also in the interest of the customer , it is important to avoid that there is no uncertainty about possible warranty rules in case of any other damage that has nothing to do with the sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; therefore , VW does not use the term &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the future , Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund on T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see calls for criminal interest from wealthy depos@@ itors - as a second institute in Germany . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Josef Paul said : &quot; it &apos;s about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight or daily bank accounts . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Association of German banks speaks of an individual case and does not see in it any signal : ordinary savers would not have to fear , for their harsh punishment . &quot;
&quot; if banks are storing money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they have to pay its 0.4 percent penalty . &quot;
&quot; as of September , the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund demands private and corporate clients for deposits over 100,000 euros on sight deposit or daily bank accounts . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 will be 400 euros in the future , &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot;
&quot; for some time , he kept 40 million euros , which could be lifted from one day to the other and which he could not evaluate . &quot;
&quot; these lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0,@@ 4 percent costs , &quot; &quot; said the bank boss . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t lay down for every million 4000 Euros . &quot;
&quot; according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter principle , the cost will now continue . &quot;
&quot; to leave the cash in the v@@ aults of the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank would be too dangerous : &quot; I &apos;ve seen four attacks , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; &quot; said the banking committee . &quot;
most customers would have an understanding and change to other investment forms .
only a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; the German Co@@ operative Association of Bavaria declared : &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy is causing considerable costs at all banks . &quot;
&quot; to carry on alone is not possible in the long term . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management , credit cards or credit transfers . &quot;
the Thurin@@ gian People and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch 2014 made head@@ lines with criminal interest for deposits of three million euros .
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , General Manager of the Banking Union , said : &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay extensively for deposits , so the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks is much too strong . &quot;
&quot; a ban@@ ker said , on T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; a clientele being a bit more generous . &quot; &quot;
this can become a problem for a small bank if it &apos;s free money .
&quot; founded in 1911 , the G@@ mund Co@@ operative bank has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; actors , sports@@ men and entrepreneurs live in the region . &quot;
&quot; there are currently no other banks known to the &quot; &quot; Co@@ operative Association of Bavaria &quot; , &quot; which calcul@@ ates a compensation for deposits from private customers , &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the President of the Bundes@@ verband der deutschen Volks@@ bank und Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ banken ( Bv@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into neg@@ ativity towards private customers is very , very high . &quot;
&quot; competition is tough , and there is a threat to the emig@@ ration of investors to the competition . &quot;
the customers in Germany will not be pleased with this in the width .
destination records : who actually bu@@ ys records ?
lonely men middle @-@ aged love plates .
&quot; before you ha@@ sten to comment , under the pseu@@ don@@ ym non @-@ all@@ uring men &apos;s middle age with rough insul@@ ts , this statement is derived from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the re@@ emergence of vinyl records is not based on a boom in Mill@@ enni@@ als who want to welcome the news of physical objects , but due to Mid@@ life @-@ nostal@@ gia . &quot;
those who recently bought a record are all for@@ esi@@ ght after the age of 45 and 54 .
&quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most impro@@ b@@ able group of buyers . &quot;
it is also not a hor@@ des by hob@@ bies - it has an emotional impact : older record buyers prefer their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree ?
&quot; if this blog was a news report on television , the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , a modest gray suit and stu@@ b before I stand , hold my hands and say something more intimate , like : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
&quot; so , let &apos;s take a look at it . &quot;
&quot; even though Soh@@ o &apos;s heart is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialty shops . &quot;
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to switch the camera for the next part in which I am in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to assess their age and mind by observing them .
&quot; Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , dem I of Si@@ ster Ray ( Number of Number : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Number of records : eight middle @-@ aged men , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the stores to fill a few hours . &quot;
&quot; is he a collector , I ask ? &quot;
&quot; I guess already , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 sheets . &quot;
&quot; these records , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I did not follow him home ) , dress the walls of his living room . &quot;
the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records he couldn &apos;t afford than to buy and buy items he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; many things I buy are from the late six@@ ties , early 70 &apos;s , who appeared when I was 11 or 12 . &quot;
&quot; he agrees that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and gladly spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink too much . &quot;
this is my vice .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers , whom he meets , applies to You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; however , he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pump , people who have heard about com@@ eback and get to buy their old records again . &quot;
&quot; from the conversations I have led , people have usually been rid of their collection so around 1998 or 1999 . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says . &quot;
this would explain the boom of tra@@ ilers of a specific age .
but what about the alleged emotional importance of records ?
it takes only a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ onica to realize that record stores offer a cal@@ ming community of like @-@ minded people .
&quot; according to We@@ z , some of the older customers took impetus to the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;
&quot; some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to pull back to the stability of familiar sound discs , of objects that wake up happy youth memories . &quot;
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or property of material possessions as a kind of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; &quot; says We@@ z . &quot;
this is a collector like me and I think it &apos;s like that with many people .
it is a simple way to deal mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; an employee flows out of a stack . &quot;
&quot; a survey by the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month , have not yet heard . &quot;
&quot; the survey also found out that 41 % have a record player whom they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record do not own record players . &quot;
&quot; at this time of the news report , I would probably look very worried as I fl@@ atten through a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( Number of data : three middle @-@ aged men ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the revival . &quot;
&quot; someone came here only recently and said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t own record players , but I would like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead sound plate so that I can put them on the shelf , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens . &quot;
&quot; more productive , less musical . &quot;
&quot; we have people who say , &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot;
&quot; they are younger people , not older ones who are only slowly coming in . &quot;
&quot; F@@ op@@ p , dedicated to the sound panels almost a whole floor , has a colorful audience when I go in . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ age and middle @-@ aged women . &quot;
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts newest synthes@@ izer and sex@@ be@@ packed pop instead of experimental jazz mo@@ ans from the loud@@ speakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers .
&quot; none of them looks strange , but next psych@@ ic trau@@ mas are hard to find if you stand beside someone for 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the store for a few minutes and considers the variety of plates available for sale . &quot;
she is more likely to make a window mannequ@@ in than a large shopping .
&quot; it does not deserve much , therefore collecting plates is not a real option , she says . &quot;
it costs a lot .
&quot; it is easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; it drives off with a de@@ ar@@ est si@@ gh . &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a store that is said to have inspired a new generation of record enthusiasts : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
&quot; while I seem to watch the jeans pants , I watch a group of young teen girls who are group@@ ing around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter are considering buying a Cros@@ ley record player . &quot;
&quot; on the left is a staircase , a wall full of records by Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; no one looks at them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them . &quot;
&quot; it is pure &quot; &quot; record @-@ art &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but considering that every attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items like plates . &quot;
&quot; even if my research shows that the results of You@@ Go@@ v are right , they are un@@ considered , at least in record shops in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors who exist in reality , record stores and online forums . &quot;
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .

French Court re@@ jects quotation on demo@@ li@@ tion of businesses in the jungle refugee camp
&quot; a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Cal@@ ais jungle where thousands of refugees live . &quot;
&quot; during a trial this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary businesses where individuals within the camp sell goods , from cigar@@ ettes to energy drinks , sell hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants . &quot;
Cal@@ ais pre@@ f@@ ecture ar@@ gues that these places should be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and that would be a risk of fire and stability .
&quot; humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups , would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
they also stated that the provisional businesses and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who run the 72 temporary businesses , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were completely understandable . &quot;
&quot; Ju@@ dge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than just feed people living in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas offer peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
&quot; one of the places that was threatened by the decline was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is commonly operated and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
&quot; more than 170@@ ,000 people have signed the petition to save the kids &apos; café . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that &quot; &quot; the closure &quot; &quot; for these children would be a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot;
&quot; the two relief organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp rose to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number until now - following a steep increase in newcom@@ ers over the course of the summer . &quot;
despite the disappointment of the Olympics : Martin remains milit@@ ant
&quot; despite his dis@@ ap@@ pointing performance in the Olympic season , Rad@@ secular Tony Martin will not be able to get down . &quot;

he did not have an explanation for his mis@@ erable twel@@ fth place in the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to me to comment on yesterday &apos;s time , &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot;
he had to analyse in peace what reasons had led to de@@ bac@@ le .
&quot; at the World Championship in October in Qatar , Martin wanted to fight for the title . &quot;
I will take a look at everything that we have changed lately .

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
&quot; Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers must adapt to the next generation speed meas@@ urer : in different states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flas@@ hes are tested , the Tem@@ por@@ otes are supposed to perform very effectively . &quot;
&quot; the futur@@ istic En@@ forcement Tra@@ ilers of Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example at accident areas , where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police . &quot;
&quot; for example , on highway construction sites or to renov@@ ating bridges with temporary temporary polishing , there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with speed limitation with a stationary gl@@ itter . &quot;
&quot; however , a permanent mobile setup can be too dangerous or costly . &quot;
&quot; the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days when measuring continuous measuring , and the case data is transmitted encrypted over a modem . &quot;
&quot; with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can be recorded simultaneously across multiple tracks . &quot;
&quot; variable speed limits as well as travel restrictions after time , driving strips and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
&quot; in the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art movement , the trailer can be moved by car with trailer hit@@ ch according to manufacturer . &quot;
&quot; so that it is not simply st@@ owed , it is lowered in the measuring mode so that the wheels in the arm@@ oured and inci@@ dentally closed outer shell disappear . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter from v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to Vit@@ ronic in different federal states and is now also used . &quot;
&quot; foreign authorities also flash with the new technique : recently France has ordered 100 pieces , after an order of 150 pieces last year . &quot;
great Britain takes silver in 7 @-@ month Ru@@ g@@ by after Fiji Master@@ class Gold reco@@ vers
&quot; Britain &apos;s impressive performance at 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt in the final hur@@ dle in the final hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were defeated here in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ an Stadium . &quot;
&quot; Fiji gave a master class in handling , side @-@ step@@ ing , back @-@ back , line @-@ up and raw power to win gold - her first Olympi@@ ad of any color . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was missed by the not too bad silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they hit New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall back on them in the final . &quot;
&quot; but regardless of this , Fiji would have beaten a 15 @-@ man team in this form . &quot;
&quot; it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB - but it probably won &apos;t be - that at least one Br@@ it tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is chief trainer Ben R@@ yan , the former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind it .
eight years ago she lost any game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sevilla under R@@ yan .
here they just lost one .
&quot; this s@@ lag will hurt , but progress is amazing . &quot;
Fiji started wonderful and ki@@ cked off the attacks from G@@ Bs .
&quot; it felt for the captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co . an , as if one would run into running buses . the World Series winners went up 5 @-@ 0 , as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au r@@ ushed in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with four minutes of playing time , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right @-@ hand corner . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB has hardly touched the ball .
&quot; a hil@@ arious T@@ ackle from Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the Berg of man Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to score a third goal , but Fiji only stopped . &quot;
&quot; in the seventh minute , j@@ asa ver@@ sen@@ alu@@ a stood in the right corner a touch down and there was 0 @-@ 17 for GB . &quot;
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new album since the re@@ starts and there was still over a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pressed by further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
&quot; it is as if Fiji had been born to play the 7 , while the UK was still gut@@ ted . &quot;
this is how it is .
&quot; GB carried out basic changes at half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for all four minutes , what was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova went through a brilliant inter@@ play of Fiji . &quot;
&quot; Dan Nor@@ ton launched an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went long in favor of the South @-@ se@@ ater , whose fans che@@ ered , flags and danced on the tri@@ b@@ une . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last seconds .
&quot; the whi@@ stle sounded , the fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged and GB ki@@ cked cr@@ ammed into the grass . &quot;
&quot; earlier on the day Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi@@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 , and Britain crowded South Africa in a short half @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference . &quot;
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks forward in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton interrupted the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a score among the posts in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant late tac@@ kling of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team secured the prize - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning as inspired by the fight with the coach &apos;s cancer
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ eric gold than in those games and that wants to mean something .
&quot; from the first stroke to the last 220 hard H@@ ieve who enter history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even if there were only the two who were sitting at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was there when she row@@ ed at the second Olympic stadium in the second without a tax wife , the first women in the history of British sports who laid on such a scale . &quot;
&quot; her domin@@ ance was absolute , after all her 3@@ 9th un@@ intended use , which is also un@@ paralleled . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant athletes , who gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which is not reflected in the type of triumph . &quot;
&quot; behind every gold in the herd , there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make a difference to incre@@ mental advances that make the difference and no one was more advanced than the coach who didn &apos;t know whether he would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer . &quot;
&quot; as he said , he ris@@ ky . &quot;
&quot; I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and that they did . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t do that , it spreads everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a pretty aw@@ ful situation .
it changes a little bit the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , if that was the correct term at all . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to go better soon . &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in the hospital and walked around on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be sufficient . &quot;
that &apos;s how it starts .
&quot; the rowing on itself is already a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one . &quot;
&quot; in the immedi@@ acy of the victory , their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a nerve wre@@ cking morning with it more than usual , trying to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; p@@ anning , who was a Captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery Regi@@ ment in Afghanistan , said , &quot; &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . &quot;
&quot; it repe@@ ats only how much it means to me , how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin worked . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
&quot; without Robin we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best trainer in the world . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person to exercise or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning won no race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
&quot; even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to catch up , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve . &quot;
we were caught very much at the moment .
&quot; Hel@@ en called &quot; &quot; remain in the process , stay in the process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is really important not to let yourself be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we weren &apos;t looking forward to doing something great .
&quot; we didn &apos;t want fire@@ works today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race what we did . &quot;
the couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about their future .
&quot; Glo@@ ver has to appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall . &quot;
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that it was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
&quot; in London , it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympic Champion . &quot;
it was all that new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; that feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot;
for 31 years exemplary for clarity
&quot; the managing director of the &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , reti@@ res . &quot;
the association is regarded as &quot; Bavarian far exemplary . &quot;
a small fr@@ än@@ k@@ ish drinking water @-@ purpose band@@ age as a model for the large water producers .
&quot; this is the name of the &quot; &quot; Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk &quot; &quot; ( Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk ) . &quot;
&quot; little later , the water forum of the government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia paid tribute to the association . &quot;
&quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group was &quot; &quot; Bavarian @-@ wide &quot; &quot; as exemplary . &quot;
&quot; behind all this Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the Zw@@ eck@@ verband employee , was 28 years old as Managing Director . &quot;
now he was retired at the age of 65 .
&quot; the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein @-@ based drinking water association with its headquarters in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , Breit@@ brunn , promotes about 150@@ ,000 cubic metres of water every year and supplies 32 villages and ham@@ lets with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; the municipalities are the municipalities of Kirch@@ lou@@ der , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of Ba@@ un@@ ach . &quot;
water supply contracts are available for further towns and municipalities .
&quot; the current president , Breit@@ brun@@ ner Mayor of Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was appointed as a water @-@ wart in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the association in 1988 . &quot;
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse , ranging from water line construction and maintenance work to office and organizational activities , budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency interventions at weekends , &quot; &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
&quot; as an outstanding event , they called the inauguration and inauguration of the new wells ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new wells ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , re@@ purchase of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the re@@ purchase of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the partial re@@ modeling of water pipes . &quot;
&quot; there was no stand@@ still , and there was always something new to say , because water gave life and drinking water is the most important food . &quot;
&quot; in her speech she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers faithful , reliable and correct service over 31 years . &quot;
he has applied himself with a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose band@@ age and he has lived up to the water @-@ purpose association as if it were his own company .
&quot; a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group to the nit@@ rate reduction in front of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia Water Forum . &quot;
for this he received a lot of praise and praise .
&quot; in his turn Ru@@ pert G@@ öller praised Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years . &quot;
he is the best water wart and he was a faithful boy .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
&quot; as a highlight from his point of view , he described Brun@@ nen@@ bau and the restructuring of the association . &quot;
&quot; however , the biggest challenge and the most difficult operation were the pipe break at the elevated tank near Kirch@@ lou@@ der on a 3rd January . &quot;
&quot; here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night , so that the villages could be supplied with water . &quot;
the supply of Neu@@ brunn can also be maintained once because one filled the high containers of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the drinking water @-@ purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter who succ@@ eeds Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .
soprano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko talks openly with the au@@ tism of her son Ti@@ ago - and turns to other affected parents : &quot; they must have the courage to talk about it .

&quot; when the disease had been recognized by her son , she believed that she must die . &quot;
&quot; however , the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ti@@ ago had come forward well and now learn in private in New York , where there are the best therap@@ ists . &quot;

&quot; relationship in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - man shooting to life partner , &quot;
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday at 10.@@ 45 o &apos;clock in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) .
&quot; the man called himself with us and stated to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator was on the run , after him I was publicly punished . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , because Sven S. could be on the road with the car . &quot;
&quot; the man is about 1.@@ 80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ burned and has a lat@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the police published a photo of him . &quot;
&quot; however , it is a few years old . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the man is wearing a lat@@ ch . &quot;
the man is not to be addressed directly .
&quot; he could still carry the weapon with him , so the police . &quot;
whoever sees Sven S. shall call the 110 .
the police speak of a &quot; relationship . &quot;
&quot; the victim was born in 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator in 1981 . &quot;
&quot; at first , the responsible police in Lü@@ beck wanted to do no information about the Ta@@ ther@@ ing or the relationship between perpetr@@ ators and victims ; but she confirmed that a man had been killed . &quot;
&quot; it is a killing crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t say more at this time , &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lü@@ beck . &quot;
&quot; according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special mission command ( SE@@ K ) was at the crime scene . &quot;
steel - Licht@@ blick for the German Steel Industry
the crisis @-@ torn and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional costs in the amount of millions .
financial burdens that the industry threatened with green energy promotion are from the table .
&quot; it remains with the release of the Renew@@ able Energy Sour@@ ces at the existing plants for so @-@ called self @-@ power production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) . &quot;
I am really happy that after two years we could finally achieve tough negotiations .
&quot; according to this , the European Commission had initially planned to ask the steel producers to use the gases coming from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption . &quot;
&quot; according to the German industry association , the steel industry had an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year . &quot;
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z . now there is a fundamental agreement with the European Commission for talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
&quot; only when the generators are replaced in the steel works , an EEG lev@@ elling of 20 percent is required . &quot;
but also this will not be raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission on self @-@ electricity production .
&quot; in this way , the status quo of the current regulation is extensively as@@ cer@@ tained . &quot;
the successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry have a special significance .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &apos; Steel is future &apos; , this is a first step . &quot;
&quot; others have to follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; climate and employment targets are also to be p@@ onder@@ ed in the reform of emissions legislation , &quot; &quot; said IG Metall leader Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry in Europe suffers from over@@ capacity and significant price pressure . &quot;
&quot; last year , the situation worsen@@ ed further , when the world &apos;s largest producer of products rose to the world market in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand . &quot;
European manufacturers acc@@ use Chinese steel conc@@ es@@ sion@@ ing pricing dump@@ ing .
&quot; in the course of this spring , the situation has somewhat relaxed . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , imports of import duties on import steel show effect ; on the other hand , economic prospects in China have risen . &quot;
it is unclear how sustain@@ ably the price collection is .
the German industry leader Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp was cau@@ tious on Thursday .
&quot; last but not least , the prices would have stagn@@ ated . &quot;
the industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
&quot; in this context , Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp didn &apos;t want to exclude the closure of individual works . &quot;
&quot; in the German steel industry , around 8@@ 6000 people were employed at the end of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in July , despite rising prices and increasing orders , the German steel manufacturers remain cau@@ tious . &quot;
&quot; with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year , such as the Steel Community on Friday . &quot;
&quot; after a short increase in May , the produced quantity went back to the second month in a row . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production has been around two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot;
&quot; thanks to an improved order situation , the association expects an increase in output in the coming months . &quot;
&quot; community , spirit , health : singing does sen@@ iors good &quot;
&quot; singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp for her whole life : as a young girl she was part of the school choir , she took music in the school choir and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in an elderly choir . &quot;
&quot; singing moves me - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; she describes . &quot;
&quot; after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and living in total , she says . &quot;
&quot; by the way , she does something good for her health and mind . &quot;
&quot; singing is a great hobby for senior citizens from several perspectives , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German sen@@ iors division . &quot;
&quot; most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like @-@ minded people , describes H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; through regular meetings , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts . &quot;
&quot; because often social and family structures dissolve in age , a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; to speak and organize , to be able to leave and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot;
&quot; singing can be stren@@ uous in the positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
for this exercise sen@@ iors a deep and controlled breathing .
those who demand his lungs regularly will not be so quickly out of the pu@@ ste in everyday life .
&quot; even if it &apos;s about getting the sound of the voice at age , singing is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; for elderly people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Labour Association of Senior Ci@@ tiz@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations the common singing had a much higher value , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure time , she explains . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs in older people aw@@ akes many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their adol@@ escence . &quot;
&quot; through lyrics and especially melodies , people with dementia often fall back on long @-@ back events . &quot;
&quot; in singing , the head also demands special performance , explains L@@ enz . &quot;
to concentrate on one &apos;s voice and to a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
&quot; elderly people , who live alone , practice not only to concentrate on themselves . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great compli@@ ment .
the self @-@ esteem increases by singing in the choir .
&quot; to show oneself : if I practise for something long , I will get better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start singing , so there is enough . &quot;
&quot; if you want to try out a new hobby , don &apos;t hesitate - even if he thinks to have little talent , L@@ enz tells . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who hears you already , when a note goes next to it ? &quot;
&quot; looking for the right offer , Sen@@ iors have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; someone from the circle of acquain@@ tan@@ ces sings in a senior choir , you can simply join . &quot;
many towns also offer over@@ views of the choirs in the surrounding area .
whoever wants to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or church leader .
many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet .
&quot; if you don &apos;t have access to the Internet , the family , friends or neighbours may ask for help from internet research . &quot;
&quot; who wants to sing , should necessarily join a choir , advises H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
singing does good to the soul and has something liber@@ ating - that is true for all ages .
cats react sensi@@ tively as a han@@ go@@ ver on cries of the k@@ itt@@ ens
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover which effect the throwing of cat bab@@ ys on adult animals has .
&quot; to her surprise , the ch@@ ewing did not leave the males cold - however , they always beha@@ ved like the females . &quot;
female cats can see the reg@@ ression of cat bab@@ ys at the mi@@ str@@ ust of the chi@@ cks .
&quot; they respond by ten percent faster to the sounds of k@@ itt@@ ens , who in great need choose how scientists from the Veter@@ inary College and the Medical School Hannover ( MH@@ H ) have found out . &quot;
sk@@ aters also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - but always the same .
&quot; obviously the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and heavily excited k@@ itt@@ ens for the males are either un@@ noticeable or not of importance , &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the MH@@ H . &quot;
she is the author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
&quot; in a previous study , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens scre@@ am differs with the ur@@ gency of their dependency . &quot;
a total of nine adult males and eight female k@@ itt@@ ens were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the MH@@ H .
they were played for a litter of little ones who were taken out of the throwing box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
&quot; on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of more strongly excited k@@ itt@@ ens , which were additionally lifted up . &quot;
the researchers maintain their results despite the low sample of conclu@@ sive evidence .
&quot; all females , even those who had no offspring , re@@ acted to the cries , &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot;
they turned quicker to the loudspeaker when this calls were played by the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens .
this ability may possibly be inn@@ ate or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have already repeatedly investigated the reactions of women and men to baby no@@ ises . &quot;
&quot; some studies showed that women re@@ acted more sensi@@ tively to infants , regardless of whether they were pregnant or not , the bi@@ ologist reported in Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann . &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ ski resorts to Super@@ cup with &quot; Gala &quot;
Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
&quot; in Turkey , an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r . &quot;
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the coup attempt , an important football match takes place in Turkey . &quot;
&quot; in front of the Du@@ el of the Arch@@ riv@@ als between Bes@@ ik@@ tas , Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul for the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is un@@ equi@@ vocal : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced . &quot;
&quot; the government , the daily routine of normal citizens , should not be affected by the suspension of the state of emergency after the crash test in July . &quot;
&quot; this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; in this case , there is not a halt before football . &quot;
&quot; against the former strong i@@ cker Hak@@ an Sü@@ gni@@ r , the prosec@@ utor issued an arrest warrant . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the South America living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
&quot; Sü@@ ku@@ r is to be a follow@@ er of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan . &quot;
&quot; although the exception of the exception of 90 days is still valid until October , in fact , most Turks have no effect on the lives of most Turks . &quot;
&quot; the ni@@ gh@@ tly &quot; &quot; democracy guard &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country has declared Erdo@@ gan on Wednesday for an end . &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split in supporters and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the working class Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the president &apos;s friends .
but what unites the Turks with the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military put@@ sch .
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; with Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger &quot; Gala , &quot; Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski will arrive in particular again . &quot;
&quot; the Cologne in the expi@@ red season proved its sporty value : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first season as the top scor@@ er of his club . &quot;
in the final game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory hit .
the newspaper &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he completed the season in an excellent way and secured the tro@@ phy to his team .
&quot; thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record master found a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion . &quot;
&quot; after the round @-@ up K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; Li@@ ons &quot; also leave early in the Europa League . &quot;
in the Sü@@ me@@ g Li@@ g it only reached rank six .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; we &apos;ve done this and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas , the year was better . &quot;
&quot; especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who set the basis for the 14th title with 26 seasonal figures as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ ch @-@ King . &quot;
this is also the reason that fans will continue to hope for the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; in doing so , the Gom@@ ez , which was standing under contract at AC Florence , had only announced Gom@@ ez after the coup attempt to not return due to the political situation in the country after his European holidays . &quot;
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he just has to say it , &quot; quoted the specialist magazine &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; club leader Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; but if the falls should be willing to ren@@ ounce about a third of his annual value estimated at 7.5 million euros , Or@@ man made it clear : &quot; &quot; we cannot pay its salary in Florence . &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes still have medal chances at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin was blocked twice because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers Julia Step@@ an@@ ova is not allowed to start in Rio .
other over@@ riding athle@@ tics s@@ inner can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio for medals .
the topic dop@@ ing determines the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics .
&quot; the Russian swi@@ mmer Juli@@ ja Je@@ fi@@ m@@ ova , who compla@@ ined about her starting right before the games after a dop@@ ing @-@ lock , was plu@@ gged out mer@@ cil@@ essly at her start ( 100 meters chest ) . &quot;
&quot; there was a qu@@ ir@@ ky scene : with a set smile , she was still in the hall and provoked her appearance . &quot;
&quot; when it was fixed that she won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out into a storm @-@ storm . &quot;
&quot; but there are many other sports@@ men , who , despite dop@@ ing past , go to the start at the Olympic Games in Rio . &quot;
here is an overview :
&quot; J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100m @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he was blocked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
&quot; since its spell , the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion is even faster than ever before , he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is considered to be the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t . &quot;
&quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100m @-@ m @-@ relay / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to reti@@ re for a six @-@ month lock in 2010 after the pain was taken by Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; after surgery , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended herself . &quot;
Sandra Per@@ ko@@ vic ( Dis@@ cus / Croatia ) : in 2011 the 2012 Olympic champion was tested positively on the banned stimul@@ ant drug meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ ko@@ vic denied the know@@ ingly in@@ gest@@ ed intake and was closed for six months .
the four fur@@ th@@ est lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the great gold fav@@ ori@@ tin .
&quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time world champion over 400 m , was tested positive in 2010 and closed for 21 months . &quot;
a means of penis enlargement have been responsible for em@@ bedding .
&quot; this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 m of the fastest man in the world . &quot;
&quot; Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( hammer throw , Belarus ) : hardly any ath@@ lete had so many medals afterwards . &quot;
&quot; thus , T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later after he was diagnosed with testosterone dop@@ ing . &quot;
the meanwhile 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to hand over Olympic silver in 2004 because of ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the European title in 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
&quot; based on a verdict from the International Sports Court , he also received the Bronze Med@@ al of the 2008 Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at 80@@ ,@@ 04 m he ranks second in the world rank@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the world record and gold fav@@ ori@@ tin was tested positive only in May but may still start in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , references to taking a forbidden dietary supplement have been found , the lock of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA fell mild and ran already on 13 July . &quot;
bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian viol@@ ates - Sever@@ al dead
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday early . &quot;
&quot; she had suffered cuts and had been treated in hospital , but I have already left it again . &quot;
she planned her home trip for the beginning of September .
&quot; whether from the further explo@@ sions on the island of Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ phon , Austrian citizens are also still unclear . &quot;
&quot; in this respect , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities , such as Schn@@ ö@@ ll . &quot;
&quot; at about 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in was first explo@@ ded on Thursday evening in a Night@@ life of two bombs . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , a Tha@@ il@@ anders were killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dut@@ ch@@ men and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning two explo@@ sives went up again , and another man was killed according to the authorities . &quot;
&quot; even from Ph@@ u@@ ket , a bomb explosion was reported in the morning . &quot;
&quot; during the det@@ onation in the vicinity of the seaside resort of Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured according to police instructions . &quot;
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ eastern coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , killing a city cler@@ k . &quot;
&quot; according to the authorities in a flower bed in front of the territory of the coastal police , the explo@@ sives had gone into the air . &quot;
finally Det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast and in Ch@@ um@@ ba on the south @-@ eastern coast called for several injuries .
&quot; from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was said . &quot;
&quot; the bomb attacks carry the same manuscript , &quot; said army general Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ am@@ av@@ ee Friday early to journalists . &quot;
we assume that this is a coordinated attack .
&quot; it is too early to express themselves to possible motives , but most likely it is about the deeds of Muslim rebels . &quot;
&quot; Thai media also wanted to recognise a pattern in the attacks , which is typical for the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country . &quot;
&quot; the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks would not be linked to the Islam@@ ist revolt movement or international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local sab@@ otage which restricted itself to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot;
&quot; rather , one assumes that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta have been laid . &quot;
&quot; the authorities have received sec@@ rec@@ y advice on upcoming attacks in the south of the country over the past few days , although they have not been informed of the exact time and places . &quot;
it is still unclear which group behind the attacks is still unclear .
&quot; the police showed their officials all over the country to enhance security around important government buildings as well as airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand , there are always smaller bombs , but they are mostly not against tourists . &quot;
&quot; in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace , which was used over the years by Tha@@ il@@ ands king B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j . &quot;
&quot; after the recent bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities . &quot;
&quot; high security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings . &quot;
&quot; after disputes between security forces and the Muslim population , there will be no need to travel to these provinces . &quot;
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were followed a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution executed by the military jun@@ ta .
this gives the military great influence over the years to come .
&quot; Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said that the bombs had been an attempt to stal@@ k chaos , while the country moves towards stability , an improvement in economic conditions and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military un@@ ta , who had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody un@@ rest , re@@ affir@@ med itself to have the kingdom restored to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the rebel@@ li@@ ous rebels in the extreme south of the country for years . &quot;
more than 6@@ 500 people have already been killed in the conflict .
&quot; almost a year ago , 20 people were killed in Bangkok in a attack on a popular Hind@@ u shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists . &quot;
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack of the recent history of the country .
the right &quot; identity movement &quot; has become the target of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection .
&quot; after several regional offices , the constitu@@ tion@@ ists in the Con@@ federation have also provided the group under observation . &quot;
&quot; at the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; , we see evidence of efforts against the free democratic basic order , &quot; said Constitutional Court Director Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate of the Deutsche Presse @-@ Agentur in Berlin . &quot;
this is how immigrants from Islamic faith or from the Middle East are de@@ fam@@ ed in extrem@@ ist ways .
that is why we are now also watching the movement .
the &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots that have been active in Germany since 2012 .
&quot; it turns against &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration , &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity through alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in nine German states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Nieder@@ sachsen , Saxony and Thurin@@ gia - observe the &quot; Identi@@ ties . &quot; &quot;
&quot; during the decision , Ma@@ ate said that his authority was closely aligned with the local authorities . &quot;
&quot; groups such as the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; said the Head of the Constitutional Court . &quot;
&quot; in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with a you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
the same Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not an embarrass@@ ing advertisement for one &apos;s own thing .
propaganda is meant to appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
&quot; last but not least , there have been reports from several federal states about contacts of the &quot; Identi@@ ties &quot; to Af@@ D politicians . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , he did not know how to do that . &quot;
&quot; for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this type are only relevant at some point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether or not the respective party - in this case , the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , will change their direction and become extrem@@ ist . &quot;
the decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not recognizable .
&quot; with a view to the marked increase in legal crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shel@@ ters , Ma@@ ate said he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context . &quot;
but we have seen in recent years that there can be right @-@ wing terrorism structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal Group .
&quot; it may well be that other right @-@ wing groups or groups of small groups are planning to plan attacks against asylum seekers , against refugee homes or attacks from other extrem@@ ist motives . &quot;
&quot; however , a Germany @-@ wide or Europe @-@ wide control of right @-@ wing terrorism cannot be discern@@ ed . &quot;
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
Ma@@ ate expressed concern about the fact that many attacks went to the account of people who had not appeared in the right scene before .
this is wor@@ rying .
&quot; many of the susp@@ ects on asylum lod@@ gings were previously not known as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or supporters of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; so many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , who might have been politically in@@ different , or have chosen CD@@ U , SPD or lef@@ ti@@ sts , who , however , have radic@@ alised themselves by right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist m@@ oods . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes an inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
the Olympics or World Records will not always determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the bold appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly overweight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia were so slow that he was no longer able to see in the TV pictures . &quot;
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was selected .
&quot; in social networks , Hab@@ it became a viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished his lead with a set@@ back of 48 seconds and occupied the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters . &quot;
but it was rather his not just sporting figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming more famous in under@@ represented countries .
&quot; as in Ethiopia , most athletes run , Hab@@ te simply wanted to do something different . &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
the first nick@@ names soon made the round .
some media referred to him as &quot; Ro@@ bel of the W@@ al . &quot;
&quot; based on a &quot; &quot; well @-@ being &quot; , &quot; the English bou@@ levard &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; was funny about him with &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; his time , he only hit a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter fre@@ estyle , played no role . &quot;
compar@@ isons with Eric the E@@ el were also drawn .
Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i took care of media attention at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney .
&quot; unforgettable was the appearance of the flo@@ ats from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to compete alone in a subur@@ b of 100 metres of fre@@ estyle . &quot;
&quot; fr@@ en@@ e@@ tically , M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time . &quot;
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim only eight months before Olympic and never had such a long distance before the competition .

Ger@@ ets@@ ried - The owner of a shop in the New Place has been stolen .
according to the police the 67 @-@ year @-@ old Ger@@ ets@@ rie@@ der had left her business on Monday at 5.@@ 30@@ pm and forgot to close a window on the ground floor .
&quot; when she returned the next morning at 8.@@ 15 o &apos;clock , about 250 Euro had disappeared from the cas@@ hier . &quot;
traces of the perpetr@@ ator could not be found .
video surveillance is also not available .
Tru@@ mp hasn &apos;t seen the im@@ pending electoral defeat so tight
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp speaks at a campaign event in Florida .
&quot; should there be nothing with the election to the US president , Donald Tru@@ mp has already an alternative video . &quot;
he then goes on vacation .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp loses the US presidential elections in November , but it doesn &apos;t matter : &quot; &quot; ultimately it will either fold or I have a very nice , long holiday , &quot; &quot; said the candidate of the Republi@@ can in a telephone interview with the US television station CN@@ BC . &quot;
&quot; if it is not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , this is fine , said Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; thus he described US President Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as founder of the terrorist Islamic State ( IS ) . &quot;
&quot; within his party , more and more resistance formed . &quot;
mail enters the trade with electric v@@ ans
an electric delivery vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other firms in the vehicle is obviously great .
the post is planning to sell your electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter too .
&quot; in the near future , the Group wants to start trading with the transpor@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; as of next year , the post office will also offer a free car market . &quot;
&quot; we want to get into the sale to third parties , &quot; said a post @-@ speaker on Friday . &quot;
&quot; the company has been checking for months whether they will be delivered to their own developed Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter , with which letters and pack@@ ets will be sold , even to other farms . &quot;
&quot; post committee Jürgen Ger@@ der had said that there are always inquiries , such as by craftsmen . &quot;
&quot; according to the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel , &quot; the Bonn @-@ based Bon@@ ner group will soon be entering the mass production of the vehicles . &quot;
&quot; in the post @-@ owned factory , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift . &quot;
Ger@@ des had announced that the Group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and make a complete change@@ over to the environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term .
&quot; we will make a very , very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot;
I can imagine that we surround the complete fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter has been active on Germany &apos;s roads since 2014 .
GF@@ RP @-@ leadership steps down after dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures
the consumer research company Gf@@ K exchanges its boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the back@@ drops suddenly came - but not quite surprising .
&quot; the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K showed that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann becomes even more uncertain , the longer the successes promised by him . &quot;
turbul@@ ence at the head of the Nuremberg market research company Gf@@ K : after again dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures and the res@@ ignation of the company management the worldwide number Five is facing a new beginning .
&quot; at the end of the year , GF@@ RP Managing Director wants to leave the company . &quot;
&quot; the Chairman of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board , Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert , is already leaving the Supervisory Board with effect from September 12 . &quot;
&quot; the management in the Management Board will take up the previous board member Gerhard Haus@@ ga@@ inger on 1 September , divided the company . &quot;
&quot; he shall officially assume the function of a &quot; &quot; Chief Executive Officer &quot; , &quot; until a successor has been found for Hart@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; as a reason for the res@@ ignation , the company called &quot; different views &quot; on long @-@ term business policy orientation . &quot;
a company spokes@@ man on Friday did not want to call for details .
&quot; who will be leading the market research firm in the future , is still unclear at this time . &quot;
&quot; in investor circles , it was said on Friday that the shareholders had been the disappointment of the continued success of the restructuring measures introduced years ago . &quot;
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been on the Gf@@ K leadership since 2011 .
&quot; the fruits of the restructuring have not yet to be seen after 5 years , &quot; said it . &quot;
&quot; in view of the last bad Gf@@ K business figures , every shareholder becomes rest@@ less at some point . &quot;
&quot; if this were the case with BMW , that would also do the qu@@ and@@ ts &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; following set@@ backs in the preceding quarters , the company could not stop its loss of power in the second quarter of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; with 36@@ 1.2 million euros , sales fell by 6.1 percent below the level of the comparable year @-@ earlier quarter . &quot;
&quot; in the first half of the year , sales tot@@ alled EUR 7@@ 2@@ 1.2 million by 3.4 percent . &quot;

&quot; the company &apos;s value amor@@ tis@@ ation of EUR 139 million , which was necessary in the consumer experience business unit , gave the Group a loss of € 14@@ 8.2 million . &quot;

accidents - Bus slip in pit@@ falls in tr@@ ench : eight injured
&quot; during an accident of a touring coach with 43 senior citizens , eight people were injured in Kru@@ mm@@ hör@@ n ( District of Aur@@ ich ) on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; two of the in@@ mates suffered severe injuries , condemned the police . &quot;
&quot; the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , according to her information , had to avoid an opposite vice , which partly drove on the counter @-@ way . &quot;
&quot; the bus came to the right from the street and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch , as a spokes@@ woman of the police of Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported . &quot;
&quot; due to the location of the bus the people could not leave the bus autonom@@ ously , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade liberated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and an emergency ambul@@ ance came to the accident site on the provincial road 2 .
the unforgettable travellers were brought back from a bus back to the Kru@@ mm@@ hör@@ ner district of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a spare bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators asked the bear@@ ers and potential witnesses to report to the police .
&quot; the charges per cubic meter of sewage will be from October 1 , 2016 for the area of the sewage system Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sh@@ ahl 3.@@ 44 instead of so far 2.@@ 10 euros ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3.@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2,@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2,@@ 18 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at the facility in Az@@ endorf , the waste water charge will be increased at the latest , if appropriate improvement measures are necessary . &quot;
&quot; after a high @-@ level calculation , the sewage treatment in Az@@ endorf will then be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter . &quot;
&quot; as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , Kul@@ mb@@ ach was approved for the approval of the budget by the Kul@@ mb@@ ach district council . &quot;
&quot; due to legal foundations , the market of Kas@@ endorf is obliged to operate the plants in a cost @-@ covering manner . &quot;
&quot; as of October 1 , 2016 , the citizens , as well as the industrial and industrial companies from Wel@@ zen@@ feld , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to dig deeper into the wal@@ let . &quot;
the fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as administrative manager Herbert Schmidt showed up to the committee , a re@@ calculation of charges for the sewage systems of the market community was necessary . &quot;
&quot; over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - and / or covers from the previous calculation period can also be compensated . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt founded the serious ag@@ it@@ ator increases with the fact that there were relatively small facilities in all three sewage systems with a very small waste water incident , which was between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; as a result of the low distribution base , for example , expenses for necessary repairs would have a serious impact on the necessary repairs of several thousand euros . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the waste water volume is slightly declining in all three plants . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in the rec@@ umbent calculation period of all three plants , renovation and repair expenses were not least noticed in a considerable scope due to their age . &quot;
&quot; the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the plants for outer dining , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p nearly 20 years old . &quot;
Schmidt indicated that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced in the Az@@ endorf wastewater facility due to damage .
&quot; after almost 20 years of operation of the first sewage slu@@ dge , the sewage slu@@ dge had to be dispos@@ ed of and an additional ventilation possibility to be installed in order to comply with the water legal requirements in the future . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; these extraordinary expenses came from the ongoing maintenance and maintenance costs , which must be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot;
&quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which in the years 2011 / 2012 were still below the current level . &quot;
&quot; stone houses made it clear that in the case of small waste water in the three plants , expenses for the operation and maintenance &quot; were full . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt , the market community of major entertainment costs in the sewage installations in the past 20 years , added to this . &quot;
&quot; according to the view of stone houses , the situation for the above @-@ mentioned facilities will continue to be prec@@ arious , especially since the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ ach@@ tal sewage treatment association is not able to expand these facilities , because it concerns public defic@@ its . &quot;
Bulgaria books for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria amounted to 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year as positive 0.2 % were recorded .
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) measured after the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
&quot; the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 amounted to 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % . &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
&quot; in July 2016 , compared to the previous month , a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods was observed : food and non @-@ alcoholic drinks ( 1.7 % ) ; transportation ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices fell in clothing and footwear ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices remained as in pre @-@ month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged . &quot;
snapshot &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect critic@@ ised as Asian car@@ ic@@ ature
&quot; Snap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say that it is in@@ sensitive to races . &quot;
&quot; with its filter tool , it enables Snap@@ chat about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders on the absur@@ dity . &quot;
&quot; you can transform yourself into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting . &quot;
&quot; the filters are un@@ bloo@@ ded , self @-@ rotating tools that produce more than 30 million self @-@ produced sel@@ fies per day . &quot;
all mis@@ steps get to the public .
&quot; in the past , snap@@ sho@@ ot@@ ers have critic@@ ised themselves in the past where they were accused of using the app to promote black face or white skin as a beauty ideal . &quot;
&quot; when this week some users suggested a filter that gave them sli@@ t eyes , fake teeth and infl@@ ated che@@ eks , some critics called it rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow face . &quot; &quot;
they wondered if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a greater problem that the company has diversity .
&quot; the news and ou@@ trage were widely spread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mot@@ her@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat shared that it would have disabled this feature . &quot;
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was meant as an homage to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
&quot; but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced racism , reminded the filter of hur@@ ting c@@ lich@@ és . &quot;
others rejected the anim@@ e comparison decided .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student , whose t@@ we@@ et was widely used across the photographs , was that the filter was &quot; hur@@ t@@ ful and sal@@ ting . &quot; &quot;
she added that &quot; it was difficult to argue with the contrast of a very reluct@@ ant Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not safe , but that the yellow face was drawn into the degra@@ ding extreme . &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stum@@ bling block .
&quot; American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand . &quot;
and snap@@ shots large audience of young people - who are more different in terms of race than their older opponents - could be more likely to expect sensitivity .
&quot; if one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats Fil@@ ters creates a picture that is offensive for a user , &quot; it is much more difficult that such things stay un@@ noticed than it was earlier , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who works as Product Manager and Engineer for Medium , decided to delete her Snap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview , she said that she believes that rapid @-@ related controversy mirrors a lack of diversity in the recruitment practices in Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the largely white , only male leaders and ended their essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce so they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint that has largely left Snap@@ chat un@@ answered . &quot;
the company publishes no numbers on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
&quot; on Thursday , the company le@@ aned Snap@@ chat to discuss the cultural background of its employees , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently hired a personnel manager focusing on sub @-@ represented population groups and internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu also said that she will let her Snap@@ chat account be closed and added , &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it is not O.@@ K. &quot;
&quot; military duct fal@@ si@@ fied IS@@ IS sec@@ rec@@ y information , establishes Committee of Congress &quot;
&quot; military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence to record an optimistic image of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , as it allowed the actual conditions on the ground , announced an inquiry committee in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can members of the Joint Military Committee , intelligence committees and military budget , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Intelligence analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments of American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; the Central Command , briefly Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; intelligence information , typically enjoyed by high @-@ level Cent@@ com com@@ man@@ ders , regularly portra@@ yed a more positive image of American efforts against terrorism as it allowed the actual conditions on the ground and were consistently positive than analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; &quot; quoted a newspaper article . &quot;
&quot; what happened at the Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when poor analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; said Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can Member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot;
the leadership mistakes in the Cent@@ Com extend to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report detail@@ ing detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces .
&quot; although there is no direct evidence suggest@@ ing that government leaders under Obama have given instructions to change the reports , it shows how analysts face the pressure from their superi@@ ors , an optimistic image of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command Press Rel@@ eases , comments and statements were clearly more positive than the facts before the congress . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ Com member publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could already begin in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ ul , the second @-@ largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigation , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Congress of Congress from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the heads of Central Command changed the intelligence reports to play down the danger of IS@@ IS in Iraq . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans called the Task Force in Life after it was played out that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports about the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights while the investigations are continued .
&quot; in addition , further investigation of the Cent@@ Com reports is ongoing by the Chief In@@ spec@@ tor of the Ministry of Defence . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , democratic members of the news service committee issued their own findings , which agree with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ com created a moder@@ ately constra@@ ined trial for the preparation of intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; announced the Executive Committee in the House of Represent@@ atives , Adam B. Schiff , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; this process , &quot; &quot; Mr. Schiff , &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; compensated the mor@@ als among analysts and &quot; &quot; gave exc@@ essively low space for diver@@ ging opinions . &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the democr@@ ats indicated no evidence of any intervention of the White House at the Cent@@ Com analysts regarding a &quot; determined political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon general inspec@@ tor , which were recorded after complaints by Cent@@ com analysts . &quot;
&quot; C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on any reports of the Congress , while the investig@@ ators of the General In@@ spec@@ tor were still under way . &quot;
&quot; but he also stated that &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ gent opinions about the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the ministry of defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the issue of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that has meanwhile been made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
&quot; however , the alleg@@ ations of the past year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State reminds of inter @-@ activities of more than ten years ago , when a Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a piece about how the then government under George W. Bush anticipated a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting of the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team headed by Mr. Hoo@@ ker stated that contrary to the government &apos;s statements against the oil refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State , there would have been no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these provisional refin@@ eries would have taken into operation to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; this recognition , however , was not published , the Times reported in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ com@@ s condem@@ nation , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legislature for its excessive positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
general Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel at the Central Command .
&quot; the USA win fourth match in the field hockey of women , a show@@ down with Great Britain stands before &quot;
&quot; one day after having shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am made the first two goals for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five gates in two games should actually represent memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember that ever done . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I do not belong to the people who keep their gates in memory .
&quot; however , she knows that : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equal in their group with the Brit@@ ons in the first place , who remain un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final match of the first round .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two will win the first and second place within their group of six teams . &quot;
the first placed will take the strong Dutch a little longer from the path that will lead the other group .
&quot; whatever the game is going on on Saturday , the Americans have fired a surprising whi@@ rl@@ wind through their success story , four years after they landed at the last of 12 places at the last London Games . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a hockey ra@@ cket in her hands ( her two older sisters were playing sports at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
she missed the 2008 Olympic Games because she couldn &apos;t qualify for the Ka@@ der .
&quot; then came the year 2012 , in which everything went wrong for them and their team . &quot;
&quot; during the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the National Team became a better turn . &quot;
&quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
we did not have the workplace in London we now have .
we have the ru@@ dder to be able to carry around completely .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the Tor@@ rei@@ gen in the first half of the game with a flash@@ back from the local area .
&quot; India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament , but the team turned out surprisingly tough and held the score of 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands . &quot;
&quot; they performed a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then pulled into the middle and kno@@ cked the ball into the gate to get the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the entire tournament for the keeper of the US , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to book one gate in each of the previous games . &quot;
she has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , how late it is , it &apos;s the Olympics . &quot;
&quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro feel permanent and inevitable , a ra@@ ging relay race between competition and aspir@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is as if the olymp@@ ic torch itself is a burning rod , which is passed from the w@@ rist@@ watch to the swi@@ mmer to the tur@@ ner for tri@@ athletes . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t turn on television , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor &apos;s conversation in the coffee shop without hearing about Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the quar@@ rel between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is at the Olympic Games for the first time , and a women &apos;s flock of dimples , could certainly be among the known names sent to Prime Time , built by sponsors and well @-@ being TV advertising if he were a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gymn@@ asts or even fen@@ cers . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the olymp@@ ic tr@@ amp gymn@@ as@@ tics . &quot;
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
&quot; further from the centre , partly in the shade are the sports which are not generally accepted : pist@@ ol shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the b@@ ust and may it rule for a long time .
&quot; but if I should make modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline . &quot;
&quot; although the trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , it was so spar@@ se the last 16 years that many of the guys I had asked didn &apos;t know that there is any kind of Olympic sport at all . &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the USA sent athletes to compete , there has never won a medal in jumping on the trampoline and had an ath@@ lete , who made it to the final round . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans for women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal this year from London .
&quot; the trampoline jumping has some out@@ sider char@@ me , partly because it sounds more suitable for the un@@ enlightened ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school than those for the Olympics . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a earth@@ bound enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has humor@@ ous potential - the carto@@ on@@ ical trem@@ bling of its never @-@ ending pr@@ elu@@ de - but also the Gra@@ zie of the gymn@@ as@@ tics and diving , the two sports that it unites essentially . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means as much as &quot; &quot; spring@@ board &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; asp@@ iring conqu@@ er@@ ors jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to land a number of falling movements ( turning , bit@@ ing and sal@@ tos ) before they land on the feet . &quot;
&quot; according to official Olympic programme , they are assessed according to performance , difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio . &quot;
the common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
&quot; in their quest for gold , medals need to go further , faster , up and down , sometimes to the finish , sometimes up and down , up and down on the playground . &quot;
&quot; they not only hunt the finish line or the starting wall , but also another height objective in the television transmission : the world or the Olympi@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; the goal @-@ oriented aspir@@ ation is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it &apos;s enough to even stir a spect@@ ator to tears . &quot;
but it &apos;s also what I feel at watching these games as something ti@@ res@@ ome .
the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward motion is not the goal .
&quot; he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less as an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down@@ wards , then effort@@ lessly up again . &quot;
&quot; there is also a competition here , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves into the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity . &quot;
it is as Zen as the competition in the Olympic Games can only be .
&quot; the women &apos;s qualification and final rounds will be held on Friday after@@ no@@ ons , in streaming at 13@@ .00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13@@ .00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will broadcast the final rounds as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14@@ .00 .
&quot; in the midst of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to be overlooked in general tum@@ ult . &quot;
&quot; if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the fear of being and the objectiv@@ ity of male athletes - as the male US tur@@ ner scre@@ amed for a short time according to The Wall Street Journal , Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his new fan base . &quot;
&quot; one generation protests &quot; in Ethiopia , Long is an ally of the USA &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators calling for political changes in Ethiopia met with the government &apos;s violent opposition .
witnesses say that ump@@ teen prot@@ esters were killed during clas@@ hes with police at firing squ@@ ads .
is Ethiopia just going to collapse ?
&quot; in the last ten years , it was one of Africa &apos;s most stable countries , a solid ally of the West with a fast growing economy . &quot;
&quot; however , protests against the government sh@@ ook the country in the last months and turned into more and more areas . &quot;
&quot; last week , thousands of people r@@ ushed to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes . &quot;
&quot; according to human rights organisations , the government &apos;s response was mer@@ cil@@ ess . &quot;
witnesses testified that police fired and killed dozens of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; in circulation , videos on the protests , which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year , show how security professionals strike young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a hand@@ stand against a wall . &quot;
the head of the UN Human Rights Council is now calling for an in @-@ depth investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa at the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
&quot; American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terror haz@@ ards beyond the region , in particular in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , receive so much Western aid . &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has improved dr@@ astically - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
&quot; the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organizations have continually led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been limited , and dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; many were sent into exile or jail , killed or driven into the des@@ ks of the desert . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; if you supp@@ ress people and have no other options except to protest , it breaks off , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in Ethiopia . &quot;
all the youth are prot@@ esting .
one generation is prot@@ esting .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gle@@ hold in relation to power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; after a far @-@ critical election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , tensions along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea rise ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June . &quot;
&quot; analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ ga@@ den , which have been enforced more or less in recent years , could benefit the tur@@ mo@@ il and arm themselves again . &quot;
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess explo@@ de after years of falling down under the surface .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
&quot; in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate with the social media since cheaper smartphones have become more and more frequent and the internet services improved . &quot;
&quot; even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter , which it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they reside . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians admitted that they assembled so to protest .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia . &quot;
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; for e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who mainly come from eth@@ ic countries , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy as they exploited the Oro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in flat @-@ land areas . &quot;
but this also changes .
&quot; we are here to co @-@ ordin@@ ate under a umbrella , &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of Oro@@ mos . &quot;
the biggest protests took place in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
&quot; many am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is un@@ fairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , which accounts for around 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in the military , intelligence , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , served for 17 years until his death in an un@@ publi@@ ci@@ zed sickness in Ethiopia for 17 years . &quot;
&quot; he was seen as a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think about corners . &quot;
analysts say that he was especially vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and using special commission@@ ers to manipul@@ ate enemies and make them harmless .
&quot; the present regime lacks this basic skill , &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiopia &apos;s new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ ash Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was selected for relatively obsc@@ ure reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ ash arrives from the South . &quot;
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time Ethiopia had experienced such a tur@@ mo@@ il in 2005 , after protests prot@@ ested against elections , which according to analysts apparently p@@ lied by the government and then stolen . &quot;
&quot; during the ensu@@ ing ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if they were less than in the last months and that time of un@@ rest went over relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; development experts praised Ethiop@@ ian leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , as well as for their meas@@ urable progress in poverty reduction . &quot;
but obviously this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal mis@@ fortun@@ es of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it assumes a dangerous eth@@ ni@@ cal form .
&quot; last month prot@@ esters attacked Gon@@ dar , an am@@ ian city , by Tig@@ ray , and hatred towards the Tig@@ ray is becoming more and more common in social media . &quot;
analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as the base for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over the neighboring Somalia , although it recently announced that it closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le region . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; is a very thin ti@@ ght@@ rope walk . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp explains his statement Obama has founded IS@@ IS &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
&quot; Donald J. Tru@@ mp tried to disp@@ el the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his repeated claim that President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton had been the &quot; founders &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not serious . &quot;
&quot; this clari@@ fication raised new questions on the communication skills of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate , whether he was able to communicate clearly and comprehen@@ sively with the American public . &quot;
&quot; it also brings his comrades who endeav@@ our to take protection during an event@@ ful phase , into the peculiar position , to explain the statements he did not mean at all . &quot;
&quot; having made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tru@@ mp questioned the alleg@@ ation on Thursday and insi@@ sted on insi@@ sting that he really did not intend to suggest that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS . &quot;
but in an early morning twe@@ et on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp said he was just sar@@ c@@ astic .
&quot; the T@@ we@@ et was contrary to the previous day when Mr. Tru@@ mp spoke in a number of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation was completely serious . &quot;
&quot; when Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t &apos;s conservative Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help weak@@ en the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate didn &apos;t want to know about it . &quot;
&quot; the last storm of criticism falls down to Mr. Tru@@ mp , while he has tried to draw the focus of his campaign for falling demand values on the economic situation . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Mich@@ igan this week .
&quot; on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp tried to return to this subject again . &quot;
&quot; on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
&quot; at the end of July he critic@@ ised himself as he said that the Russians should h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but he later said , &quot; Of course , I thought the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tru@@ mp to post@@ p@@ one linguistic boundaries in politics and then return to demand .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are taken up by his fans , how they arrive , and then &quot; clear &quot; depending on how the reaction fails . &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I think he is clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough , so that they can be interpreted in various ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tru@@ mp has adopted an even more corro@@ sive tone , as his conversion values have gone further . &quot;
&quot; a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a leadership with a great advantage in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tru@@ mp is generally trying not to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his humour . &quot;
&quot; but while he rein@@ forces the focus of attention in the last few months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s Scher@@ ze has brought his loyal comrades into the uncomfortable situation , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tru@@ mp@@ s most prominent advocate , today gave great effort to defend the candidate in a CN@@ N interview of Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comment@@ aries , &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani , so he questioned Mr Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that before Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown small organization , he called it back@@ bit@@ er , completely wrong and so it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most of the mainstream Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State , allowed IS@@ IS to spread out aggressive under control of the situation in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp continued his attacks on the media and accused them of getting around on each of his words and being accused of him . &quot;
&quot; he mo@@ aned the &quot; poor , mis@@ erable &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; You can &apos;t ! . &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats mo@@ cked Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s ap@@ ology as a further proof that he was un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
&quot; once pushed over the price of the market , Café appears in Green@@ point &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a fancy cafe in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but served for 15 years of good coffee . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue store front were pushed out . &quot;
&quot; the store So@@ ap Cher@@ ie , replacing the Ver@@ b in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes . &quot;
locals gu@@ essed it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; &quot; I know New York is changing , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel is excep@@ ted and Ver@@ b is now a soap shop . &quot;
&quot; but when New York is changing , it is also re @-@ invention . &quot;
&quot; a revi@@ ved Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new club has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of the club is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new café . &quot;
he began to work in Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
&quot; when a client offered him to provide funds for a new outer cell , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , retained a lot . &quot;
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els bought the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
&quot; on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese , and there are gar@@ nish tops such as cap@@ ers and s@@ aut@@ é@@ ed onions . &quot;
there are natural attractions .
&quot; the café serves no more beer , but there are fresh juices . &quot;
after nine months Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; many old customers were also pushed by prices from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; recently on a Sunday , Rebe@@ cca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer . &quot;
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived earlier in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the club regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after being drawn to Green@@ point , she would take her way . &quot;
&quot; after the verb was closed , she had a while to sink the coffee , she said . &quot;
&quot; it was clear to me that it was at the cup of coffee and culture that I liked , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now she drinks coffee again , even if she ordered a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on this day instead of her usual iced coffee , which is another new addition . &quot;
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long @-@ standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003 .
he went there before the job and in@@ vari@@ ably ordered the same .
&quot; I came quarter after seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said . &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
&quot; nowadays Ros@@ enthal gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he won &apos;t have a res@@ ent@@ ment over the fact that the soap shop took the old business room .
&quot; in fact , the owners of So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered to produce a special soap for bre@@ w with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of the cafe as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go into her offer , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional , Polish inhabitants of Green@@ point have also accepted the café . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated the menu to Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he prepared to exhibit her soon , so that his new neighbours feel welcome . &quot;
the site also has other advantages .
a local juice shop wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee into the bottle .
there is a chance that the café is expanding to an adjacent building .
a new verb is enough for many customers to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed .
&quot; when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and the funeral took a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; a plentiful meal &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his ascension to the president , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roosev@@ elt took lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
&quot; as a gourmet , President Roosev@@ elt had a passion for refined delicacies at Fi@@ fth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water@@ shed soup . &quot;
&quot; its menu on this day was a little more humble : stu@@ ffed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
&quot; CO@@ P@@ last book &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; was about Chinese cuisine in the USA , while bri@@ ck@@ man told in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from the food perspective . &quot;
&quot; her latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity when they met with a re@@ porter at the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , fri@@ lls snack at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; Ziegel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetables . &quot;
&quot; when the re@@ porter ordered h@@ ack@@ et , this found the pair matching the food in the era of Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich food was very popular , &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread . &quot;
they were prepared from an ingredient and something cheaper that reaches the ingredient .
imagine eating so many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve them for dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ inning .
&quot; it must have settled in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before Great Depression , the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at Buffet . &quot;
&quot; men &apos;s teams cooked for male fel@@ ines and it was served freshly baked past@@ as for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; it was Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; marks the ground with which the country moved to be no longer the country of land . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when food was a central , sharpen@@ ed theme for the Americans , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; the new budget was just as tight : mysterious foods such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es were added to stap@@ le foods that recy@@ cle c@@ asser@@ ol@@ le as a &quot; &quot; wonderful way of eating food residue &quot; , &quot; Ziegel@@ man noted , because coo@@ ks could hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit .
&quot; meat , which was the center of American cuisine for years , became a rarely served luxury . &quot;
&quot; peculiar mixes were tested , as a low @-@ cal@@ orie and nutri@@ tious satisfaction had priority over taste or even healthy common sense . &quot;
&quot; during her research for the book , which includes recipes , bri@@ ck@@ man prepared a court of this epoch , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular addition at noon , &quot; Co@@ e says . &quot;
&quot; Bri@@ ck@@ mann continues : &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not match each other .
it was typical for many of the domestic recipes .
&quot; as never before or ever since , fiscal econom@@ ists - including Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - influenced the food habits of the country . &quot;
&quot; by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; house@@ keepers &quot; and the challenge to transform P@@ amp@@ e like cre@@ amy sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ rots into delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a feast of historic goo@@ dies .
&quot; in particular , the reports on the response of the government to the hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cake @-@ attitude , are particularly tasty . &quot;
&quot; while publicly praised the simple I@@ owa farmer &apos;s kitchen of his kitchen , he spoke as the million @-@ million man of the world to whom he had become . &quot;
&quot; he liked continental cuisine such as fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
he ate in an almost gold @-@ plated dining room and wore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was wonderfully realistic .
President Roosev@@ elt might have committed the same mistake if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to make an example with his stomach .
&quot; as described in the book , the companion of a house@@ keeper with no interest in tastes by Mrs. Roosev@@ elt did that the White House produced the most boring meal in Washington , but also one of the most comfor@@ ting ones . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of Great Depression , dealing with food , was rejected as soon as the country got back on the legs . &quot;
&quot; the legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food , said Ziegel@@ man , as well as how science was applied to food . &quot;
the couple had better understood the eating habits of Ziegel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law when writing the book - for example how she could not throw food away .
&quot; she had a real fear of wa@@ sting food , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; brick was rec@@ alling , &quot; They actually made people sick . &quot;
there was the attack of the wind .
&quot; after the plates at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s were cleared , they and co@@ e pulled out a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert made by President Roosev@@ elt for lunch . &quot;
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man , adding that it was a common trick to miss a modest name . &quot;
&quot; there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
&quot; each di@@ ver di@@ vul@@ ged a spo@@ on@@ ful in the teeth , brown gli@@ b@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; amaz@@ ingly , it tasted not bad . &quot;
Co@@ E took three times a night .
&quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ erer he said to his wife , &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
killed in bombing attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar devoted his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked all to save lives to others .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died even during a barrel bomb attack by Assad &apos;s regime .
&quot; O@@ mar was a member of the White Helm@@ ets , a civil protection group that , according to Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved almost 60,000 people . &quot;
29@@ 00 volunteers put their own lives on the game to attract people from bom@@ bed houses and to help in the war zone first aid .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the face of the group : a video of the civil prot@@ ector showing him in a 11 @-@ hour saving of an infant from the rub@@ ble of a house went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians a shining symbol in the horror of the war .
&quot; but he never saw himself as a hero , but he said , &quot; &quot; For me that is the real Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when I die , I think that God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot;
&quot; shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the latest bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the helicop@@ ters have dropped four barrel bombs over the Al@@ z@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlorine gas . &quot;
&quot; a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath . &quot;
&quot; we now eliminate the toxic rem@@ nants of the bomb , so that not children play with it , &quot; the picture quotes his final words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ shar@@ k : the oldest verteb@@ rate is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland h@@ arks usually only come to the surface in winter .
this shar@@ k was able to return to the sea after an investigation on board the S@@ anna research vessel .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland h@@ arks receive up to 150 years of offspring .
&quot; lei@@ surely , the Greenland swi@@ ms along the ground of the North Atlantic , in an hour it comes on average just 1.@@ 220 meters wide . &quot;
&quot; only when it comes to it , the five @-@ metre @-@ long animal acceler@@ ates at sat@@ te 2,@@ 6 km / h - and with this top speed is half as fast as a seal . &quot;
&quot; this lifestyle , characterised by slow@@ ness , seems to be a pat@@ ron@@ age for a high age . &quot;
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at least from a Gr@@ ön@@ k@@ hai who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; ins@@ anity , &quot; comments Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this li@@ fes@@ pan that represents a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot;
&quot; ad@@ mitt@@ edly , the evolutionary bi@@ ologist suppos@@ es that Greenland will be stone @-@ old . &quot;
only the evidence was missing .
&quot; Greenland h@@ arks are difficult to observe , after all , they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Spitz@@ bergen . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear only in the winter on the surface . &quot;
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland .
&quot; their time @-@ pent@@ ec@@ amping became to them , when they paid six animals with a transmitter before S@@ val@@ bard . &quot;
&quot; loo@@ t still make this sh@@ arks : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear . &quot;
possibly they ch@@ ase sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice @-@ sea and look for cad@@ aver that tor@@ ches from higher layers of water down .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland h@@ arks who took fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic .
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimet@@ res long , while the largest 50@@ 2 centimet@@ re measured . &quot;
&quot; to determine the age of the animals , they analysed the lens core of the sh@@ arks with the carbon @-@ 14 method . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eye lens is created before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained in it will no longer be renewed . &quot;
the two smallest sh@@ arks had stri@@ k@@ ingly much carbon @-@ 14 in the l@@ enti@@ cular nucleus .
&quot; therefore , their birth should be after the early 1960s , when atomic weapons attempt to in@@ ject large amounts of this radio@@ active carbon into the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , in the third @-@ smallest animal in the length of 220 centimet@@ ers , the l@@ enti@@ cular nucleus , on the other hand , contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons attempt , so it should have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; all larger Greenland h@@ arks , on the other hand , had normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities in their l@@ enti@@ cular nucleus , resulting in cosmic radiation in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock showed an age of 3@@ 35 years for a 4@@ 93 cen@@ timeter long Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ shar@@ k , while the record shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ res might even be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; only then , that Gr@@ ön@@ k@@ hai @-@ females get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known . &quot;
now the researchers were able to assign age to an old age .
&quot; since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ res probably stood on the threshold to the sexually mature and its age with 156 years was determined , Greenland sh@@ arks with the increase obviously can be at least one and a half centuries time . &quot;
this is also likely to be a world record for verteb@@ rates .
&quot; that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ em@@ es live mainly in icy waters , is no coincidence . &quot;
&quot; the previous record holder , a 2@@ 11 @-@ year @-@ old Greenland @-@ whale , in whose bac@@ on at the neck became a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ po@@ on tip , was caught in front of Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there frequently runs on a flame of as@@ par@@ ag@@ us . &quot;
so they mature later - and age more slowly .
&quot; in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals are often very large . &quot;
because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal loses heat .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much bigger than with one gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as possible , &quot; &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot;
&quot; a very large animal , on the other hand , should invest its resources in a long life . &quot;
building site in double pack
&quot; with topics relating to building construction , the Municipal Council has dealt with a focus on the latest session . &quot;
&quot; with relief , the committee assumed the communication of mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; finally , the marketing of the recently reported residential areas can begin . &quot; &quot;
&quot; after clari@@ fying the properties , par@@ c@@ els and en@@ closures and the applications for sur@@ veying , the sale of the plots in the residential areas &quot; &quot; Street @-@ weg &quot; &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( Bin@@ der@@ straße - Ex@@ construction section 1 ) is no longer in the way to interested parties . &quot;
the Municipal Council is convinced that the construction areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schön@@ au attract young families and other sen@@ iors .
&quot; as it was meant , bau@@ ch@@ men can report immediately in the town hall , and the public council is expected to give advice on the allocation of the plots in its September session . &quot;
&quot; in order to be able to respond also to requests for the settlement of other commercial enterprises , connected with the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided to change the land use plan that was newly created in the spring of this year . &quot;
&quot; thus , in the lower @-@ time lar@@ n area , the business area that has been identified there will be extended by two plots in the direction of state road 2@@ 112 . &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from the Bre@@ x@@ it
&quot; as a result , the city on the Main has the best opportunities to attract new jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg . &quot;
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Bre@@ x@@ it vote , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of the Financial Markets and Real Estate Markets of the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether budgets will continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot;
&quot; for the so @-@ called EU passport , admission to the United Kingdom is enough . &quot;
this is using large US banks .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
&quot; the lob@@ b@@ ying association &quot; &quot; Frankfurt am Main Finance &quot; &quot; calcul@@ ates with 10,000 new jobs on the Main within five years . &quot;
&quot; for Frankfurt , such as the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines responsibility for monetary policy and over@@ sight over the biggest banks in the euro area , as well as other important authorities such as European insurance supervision E@@ IO@@ PA and the Risk Council ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; while in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but it is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; ad@@ mitt@@ edly , Luxembourg hides a large fund sector , but just as Dublin does not meet the infrastructure in the infrastructure . &quot;
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport .
&quot; in addition , the city has an easy @-@ to @-@ use commercial property . &quot;
&quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the rent for first @-@ class commercial real estate is 50 percent higher than on the Main River . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure , as well as less crime . &quot;
&quot; in a ranking of Mer@@ cer &apos;s management consultancy , the city is ranked 7th , Luxembourg in place 19 , Dublin in place 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7th place . &quot;
&quot; even if quality of life is a matter of preferences : &quot; &quot; with its strong position as a financial centre for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors , &quot; &quot; concludes the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; but in spite of Bre@@ x@@ it V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial center in Europe , my economic researchers . &quot;
&quot; the balance of power : in London , according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba , around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking sector at the end of 2015 , in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2500 . &quot;
Gilead gets legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
an American Ju@@ dge decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to a refund of the legal cost you have incurred from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co . Inc .
&quot; in June , Gilead was exemp@@ ted from damages amounting to $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster medications called so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge revealed a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including the opinion and other un@@ ethical actions . &quot;
&quot; at the request of the law@@ suit on Thursday , US official Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead ab@@ uses the costs incurred during the defence of the case . &quot;
&quot; Mer@@ ck is trying to equ@@ alise with Gilead , which controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can heal over 90 percent of patients with liver disease . &quot;
&quot; the case goes back to 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck su@@ ed each other and claim ownership of laboratory work , the Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir ber@@ n@@ ag , the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead . &quot;
troops supported by the US say they have reg@@ ained complete control over Man@@ bi@@ j by the Islamic State
&quot; troops supported by the US have re@@ conquered full control over the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border , after the last IS fighters left the city , a spokes@@ man of the group on Friday said . &quot;
&quot; the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) stem from the left @-@ wing group of fighters who have buried themselves within the city , currently the city . &quot;
&quot; they released over 2,000 civilians who were held ho@@ stages by the fighters , Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j Military Council , allied with the D@@ KS , shared with Reu@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; the city is now under complete control , but we are carrying out clean @-@ up works , &quot; &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot;
Clin@@ tons earn 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton published her fiscal statement on Friday , which resulted in the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , Clinton &apos;s USD 1 million donated funds to the Clinton Foundation , chi@@ ef@@ ly to the Clinton Foundation ; the former president Bill Clinton donated $ 5.3 million in speech hon@@ or@@ ships ; the former Secretary of State gave a USD 3 million income from the publishing house Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for her book on her office in the State Department . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s candidate for vice pres@@ idency , Senator Tim ka@@ ine from Virginia , published his tax declarations for the last ten years together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton . &quot;
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards regarding financial transparency , &quot; Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i announced in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in a stark contrast , Donald Tru@@ mp is hiding behind false exc@@ uses and back@@ ers in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax statements . &quot;
&quot; it is customary for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations , although they are not oblig@@ ated by law because of this . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have stated as a reason for his refusal to have a tax check by the tax authorities . &quot;
&quot; they are on the move , &quot; &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s election campaign in Ian S@@ ams on Twitter , with regard to the publication of the presidential candidate of the Democrats . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s special advis@@ er , said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tru@@ mp to release something before tax inspections are not completed . &quot;
&quot; critics , among other things also the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already vo@@ iced that his refusal to ask questions regarding wealth , his donations for char@@ itable organisations , his deal@@ ings and various other connections , especially with Russia . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has already over@@ threw herself on the subject and published a video on the Internet on Friday , in which high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tru@@ mp requested his tax return . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , she spoke about the topic during a speech on the economy in Mich@@ igan . &quot;
&quot; he refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and publish his tax statements . &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Politi@@ co reported that in the 1990s , Tru@@ mp has paid no or only very little taxes during the 1990s , and an economic journalist in the New York Times quoted a number of tax consultants and tax consultants on Friday that this could still be the case . &quot;
federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a scheme that is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor @-@ War@@ ren Buff@@ ett which would ensure that individuals who earn more than USD 1 million earn a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka , Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate took his seat here , met Tru@@ mp for a meeting to exchange their tax declarations . &quot;
&quot; Buff@@ ett said he was also subjected to a control examination of the I@@ RS , and Tru@@ mp was afraid of the elec@@ torate and not before tax authorities . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s campaign has published tax declaration dating back to 2007 .
&quot; the Clin@@ tons live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , mean an effective federal tax rate of about 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 40@@ ,5 % . &quot;
&quot; the tax return of Clin@@ tons in 2015 showed that it was just USD 100 of their income as a salary , unlike most of the Americans . &quot;
&quot; its main investment position was a cost @-@ effective index fund , from which Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and earnings of USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 were tax@@ ed . &quot;

&quot; con@@ doms with ch@@ ili@@ pow@@ ders , fire@@ works fo@@ xes promote dance ani@@ as elephant protection &quot;
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going to inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them filled with ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ des .
&quot; the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ Guide Foundation , which had the idea already years ago , has intensified its promotion along with the U.S. natural protection by trained volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their houses and harvest without hur@@ ting animals . &quot;
&quot; before that , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves . &quot;
Friday is the World Phone Day dedicated to animal protection .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we have been able to observe a change in their attitudes within these communities , and they are much more confident that they can keep the eleph@@ ants from their fields without har@@ ming the elephant , &quot; said the CEO of Hon@@ ey@@ Guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message . &quot;
the first two steps include the light of the elephant with a torch and blowing in a horn .
&quot; if he is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; chicken cloud &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot;
&quot; mixed with earth , combined with a fire@@ work body , it is packed into a con@@ dom , whose end to the ignition cord is turned . &quot;
&quot; when it is lit , the con@@ dom mel@@ ts with a b@@ ang and spra@@ ys fine dust on the air . &quot;
a touch is usually already sufficient to hunt the elephant .
&quot; one last possibility is a laun@@ cher , who shoots a fire@@ works fire@@ works in the air while causing a loud , bright explosion . &quot;

Jewish director sm@@ ashed Berlin hotel because Israeli pre@@ di@@ alling was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; call - RT News
&quot; a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media watch after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin had not listed an Israeli pre @-@ election , as it demanded Arab guests according to a staff . &quot;
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; made his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel in the country &apos;s list of countries . &quot;
&quot; however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
he wrote to Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i B@@ rist@@ ol offers a possibility to choose Israel from its own call centre . &quot;
&quot; after an explanation , the director appe@@ aled to the hotel reception . &quot;
&quot; the answer he received there , &quot; &quot; shocked him , &quot; &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the hotel employee said that the measure was an &quot; deliber@@ ate decision by management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot;
the reason behind it was even more fur@@ ious in the director .
&quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is er@@ ased , &quot; &quot; said the employee of Lanz@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; big shame , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were horri@@ fied by this event and troubled .
this is really sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even an even greater dis@@ grace .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel to &quot; &quot; draw the right conclusions &quot; , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
the incident triggered a fairly large resonance on the Internet where people called it a sc@@ andal .
&quot; some of them subordin@@ ated to the Kemp@@ inski Hotel , that it had given the alleged &quot; &quot; re@@ for@@ estation of Arab guests &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; be ashamed , &quot; &quot; said it in another post , in which it was pointed out that the hotel , which is located at the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is near a synagogue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly referred to all alleg@@ ations and called the incident a &quot; &quot; sight &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; exc@@ used &quot; &quot; in Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct order , &quot; &quot; Israel wouldn &apos;t be included in the quick electoral list , &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
adds that the country code is now added .
police set up tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students met on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo with the police when they assembled to demonstrate against the government &apos;s reforms to the public education system .
the police put tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; the difficulties began when police officers tried to drive the students apart , leading to the fact that the police put rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas . &quot;
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation on the plans .
&quot; according to the Gover@@ nor of the Gover@@ nor of Sao Paulo Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are converted to save money . &quot;
some of the prot@@ esters saw gra@@ ff@@ iti spra@@ ying against the provisional president Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
&quot; the recent protests took place several days after demonstr@@ ators went into the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been dismissed from office by a vote of the Senate . &quot;
trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trade turnover between Moscow and Teher@@ an grew by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , the interest in Russian companies in the country grew strongly in the country , shared the ambassador . &quot;
Russian companies are taking existing connections with Iran while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; of course , further trade expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot;
he noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 rose by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
&quot; in particular , Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the trade up@@ swing was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambassador . &quot;
&quot; for this year , D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan goes from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia . &quot;
&quot; last year , the Russian foreign representation issued around 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , primarily travel visa , to Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries concerning the number of tourists in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time only relatively few Russians are visiting Iran , something that the ambassador hoping it will change . &quot;
&quot; I personally recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who have preserved the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in a good state , &quot; he said . &quot;
looking for witnesses : sur@@ passing beverage market in Wald@@ br@@ öl
a rob@@ ber@@ y accident has been practi@@ sed on Thursday evening at the drink market of Re@@ we XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ cker Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
&quot; under the preten@@ se of a fire@@ arm , three dark dressed people who had embra@@ ced their faces , demanded the issuing of cash from the beverage agent and then fled at first on foot and then probably with a silver @-@ coloured VW Golf . &quot;
&quot; how much money has been captured , the police do not share . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ators should have been between 1,@@ 60 and 1,@@ 70 metres tall , thus relatively small . &quot;
the beverage market is accessible and poorly accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market .
&quot; after the raid , the perpetr@@ ators have to move towards Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and be fled from the gravel parking area located opposite the park entrance with the silver @-@ colored car , possibly in direction B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) . &quot;
those who have made observations about the crime time ( at 19.@@ 45 o &apos;clock ) who are in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y should urgently report to the police .
Nag@@ old : fun and fun during summer holidays
&quot; eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the social @-@ educational day group / social group work of the Nag@@ old child protection association with their assistants at their summer break in N@@ uss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er . &quot;
the family @-@ friendly group was lod@@ ged during the first school holiday week in the quiet area of Wer@@ theim Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle .
several full day trips were on the agenda .
&quot; on the one hand , we went to B@@ rescue with the visit to the stro@@ zh@@ z@@ oos . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guide in the world @-@ famous monastery . &quot;
the third ou@@ ting led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
&quot; in the Kel@@ ten@@ Museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group experienced a lot about the daily life and food of the Cel@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; on the hot days the group was delighted at the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invited for jumping , swimming and plan@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; for culinary purposes , children and car@@ ers were treated with their self @-@ prepared bodies such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; in workshops , be@@ ati@@ fied , beautiful jewelry made of pearls and stones created or made of wood a Roman mill game . &quot;
&quot; other highlights of the leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; &quot; Color@@ ful evening . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the day of departure , the sun and the children and young people returned home . &quot;
ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the gate of mercy
the ministers from the pastoral care unit E@@ yach@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way for a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
&quot; together , four stages were dealt with . &quot;
&quot; in order to bridge the time until the next pilgrimage of all mini@@ stran@@ ts to the next two years , the Minist@@ erial Conference of St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; various pilgrimage destinations have been tested and one finally decided to visit the Epis@@ cop@@ al city of Freiburg , where this year , during the Holy Year of the Mer@@ cy with the opened gate of Mer@@ cy at the Freiburg cathedral , a special pilgrimage destination was offered . &quot;
&quot; 16 Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ben@@ ol , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and holy rooms set themselves on the way . &quot;
&quot; in the evening before , priest Stor@@ ost sent pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgri@@ m crosses and par@@ ted the pilgri@@ m &apos;s blessings . &quot;
&quot; from Hor@@ b was driven by train to the starting point Vil@@ lingen , where also a Münster de@@ arly loved woman is standing and so the pilgrimage route from Münster started . &quot;
&quot; the individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening by a short impulse with different prayers , songs and written texts . &quot;
&quot; but also on the way , the Min@@ is stopped at field cross@@ ings , chap@@ els or churches again and again to sing together a song of specially arranged pilgri@@ m song . &quot;
&quot; for the overnight stays , par@@ is@@ hi@@ on@@ ers of the local par@@ ishes were available . &quot;
&quot; on the stages , Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller provided a tasty and tasty dinner and breakfast . &quot;
on the second day we went to Gü@@ ten@@ bach on the second day .
&quot; the day after this was the stage after St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting stretch of road , but in the case of secondary heat some 500 metres of altitude had to be ti@@ pped and then climbed again . &quot;
the deserved reward was a common gri@@ lling on the bad@@ ger in the evening .
&quot; after the morning impulse on the fourth pilgrimage day in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter , the final stage went to Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; clearly simplified and happy , the Min@@ is met at the Freiburg cathedral in the late afternoon and crossed the gate of mercy . &quot;
&quot; with a little impulse , God was given thanks here . &quot;
&quot; in the evening Mass in Münster , the Min@@ is arrived at the pilgrimage destination by Ko@@ operator Markus Ober@@ t . &quot;
&quot; after the divine service , the pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar . &quot;
the next day was still time for the Brei@@ s@@ gau metropolis .
in the afternoon we went back to Hor@@ b by train .
&quot; at the end , all participants agreed that the days were characterized by spirituality and a strong community experience . &quot;
&quot; Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ med home , as Br@@ ite Gold has won gold for cycling &quot;
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner last night in the men team Sprint in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor that his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y made to E@@ igen , who made the legend proud when he stor@@ med home to capture a victory from the favour@@ ites New Zealand . &quot;
&quot; England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic medals . &quot;
they repeated the trick after having won only a modest sixth place in March at the London Under@@ ground Championships in London .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as a hind@@ ran@@ ce .
Ho@@ ys retired a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton tried to close .
&quot; Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed as they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots , which now un@@ folded . &quot;
&quot; Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - four years ago with Ho@@ y winning - and Sk@@ inner clin@@ ched an olymp@@ ic record in the qualification rounds , but in the standard rounds , the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; Hin@@ der fell short after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it . &quot;
a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation taking place in a higher gear to slow down and allow Kenn@@ y and above all sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
&quot; Ho@@ y looked at his position as BBC expert and dropped Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ ds when they climbed onto the podium . &quot;
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot;
I am only here to do my best and make a name for myself .
we set up an Olympic track in the final round and defeated the World Champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; after the triumph of 2012 on the Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys site , Hin@@ der added that after a weak start he was deliberately dropped onto the track . &quot;
he later with@@ drew this statement and there was no objection from England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
this time there was no such problem with such an outstanding victory .
&quot; that said , &quot; It feels like all the UK flags on the grand@@ stand like London . &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
&quot; so many world titles have come so badly , that it was unbelievable to win again at the Olympics . &quot;
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which was won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London . &quot;
&quot; if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect successful five days in the velo@@ drome . &quot;
&quot; with the shape of Kenn@@ ys , it is in the field of possible that he repeated Ho@@ ys win of three Olympic gold medals in a competition . &quot;
&quot; this would be for Kenn@@ y - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on 23 March ( a seemingly holy date for British sports ; on the day also Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal . &quot;
that would be the same from Ho@@ y .
&quot; Kenn@@ y is next in the spr@@ int , which starts today and will go for more than three days . &quot;
&quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; he said : &quot; &quot; if he wins two other gold medals he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot;
&quot; it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England . &quot;
&quot; Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ kilometre race . &quot;
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 42 .
&quot; the world record , which won gold in London in 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 . &quot;
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held on the second day of the competition where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety .
he had argued with officers before the qualification yesterday when officials called him to measure his height .
&quot; Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell S@@ hand@@ ong , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot;
the GB team is relying on its strong platform team to dominate the medium period of the Olympic Games and get a par of medals .
&quot; after a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , expectations for Rio were shut down . &quot;
&quot; there was drama in the background , so the res@@ ignation of Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton &apos;s technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April surrounded by sex@@ ism and mo@@ b@@ bling blocks as well as retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; however , if one sees the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom it looks like the legendary reputation of G@@ Bs , which reached its climax at the perfect moment , will be repeated again . &quot;
future of the melt of Port@@ land due to lifting of the energy contract question@@ able
&quot; the future of the aluminum mel@@ ts in Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ stations of workers - are at stake , as the plant operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract , thereby raising all supply contracts , as the supplying energy company is sharing . &quot;
&quot; this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria early this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant . &quot;
a subsi@@ dy that was established for 20 years runs out in November .
&quot; up to 2,000 jobs in the installation of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are at stake . &quot;
no less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be endangered at a closure .
&quot; in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects as the melt is consumed around 10 percent of the entire generation of Victori@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 Al@@ coa closed the Point Henry melt , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year . &quot;
the melt of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks a closure .
&quot; this step follows the years of speculation about the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and finally due to the electricity price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , supplying the large aluminium melt with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three more owners will announce their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the plant is owned by a joint venture between Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , which holds the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p smaller portions . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity by the melt , &quot; said the company . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts were so @-@ called &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; &quot; that should have entered into force from November 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the contracts have a 12 month notice period , so that they will end in 2017 . &quot;
&quot; therefore , AG@@ L expects that the contracts in the fiscal year 17 will contribute to revenues , &quot; &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot;
all potential effects on the earnings to AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L announced that the value of the contracts had already been depreci@@ ated in the amount of $ 18@@ 7 million in anticip@@ ation of a cancellation .
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to withdraw the contracts , the &quot; Ab@@ ility Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the melt , or to ensure the electricity supply to the melt &quot; do not interfere . &quot;
&quot; the US company said that in 2010 , it concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang that would have come into force from November this year even if there is yet another explanation why it has res@@ igned from the contract . &quot;
analysts warn of the bad economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Port@@ land melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
&quot; in reference to the analysts &apos; statements at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations , Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen , said that Port@@ land will consume around 600 MW and Tom@@ ago some 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity per year . &quot;
&quot; should both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as a generating set , it wouldn &apos;t be good , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of Vo@@ gue &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner , 20 , model and fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ erin and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ enner clan , Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vo@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and ran to fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on her Inst@@ ag@@ ram account . &quot;
&quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover brought me to cry , &quot; K@@ end@@ all wrote . &quot;
&quot; the un@@ v@@ eiling of the cover was followed by a bizarre ( or simply keeping up with the Kar@@ das@@ hy@@ n similar ? ) , common reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an J@@ enner family ( with the exception of the problem cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n ) as well as in the presence of the most popular show bi@@ z un@@ cle and producer of Ke@@ eping Up R@@ yan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) . &quot;
&quot; that puts the c@@ lich@@ é @-@ hi@@ ve action almost every birthday of a child &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? &quot; , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to let her other girl take part in this publicity . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the September edition of the Vo@@ gue , a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an began with certainty . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim likes her , as far as the Vo@@ gue cover is concerned ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were on it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself . &quot;
the September edition is the most sal@@ eable issue of the year for Vo@@ gue .
&quot; with a circum@@ ference that resembles more an illustrated book than a fashion magazine , the output attracts a large number of advertis@@ ers ( Accor@@ ding to Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were of the 8@@ 32 pages of the roller 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) . &quot;
the un@@ v@@ eiling of his cover stars is so eag@@ erly awaited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine still le@@ aked before the official announcement .
&quot; women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and K@@ ate Mos@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties that mo@@ ck@@ le &quot; as &quot; models , which are celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; on the cover . &quot;
&quot; Oscar @-@ winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor . &quot;
&quot; but even with the small chance that Mrs. J@@ enner , who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - falls under the former category , is in good company . &quot;
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous persons or reality stars or youngsters of today who know how to turn a good Snap@@ chat video ( even though it applies to J@@ enner ) .
they are really talented women who exc@@ el in the entertainment industry .
&quot; Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; of course , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s success doesn &apos;t like everyone . &quot;
&quot; with their reality TV story , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos; position in the fashion world was always a little ten@@ se . &quot;
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ enner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did called her &quot; The Mist@@ akes of the Eye . &quot;
these feelings sounded very high when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue cover .
but lying around seems to pass by at the point .
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner is on the cover of the September issue of Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
it runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
she makes advertising for your pri@@ mer by Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
they and all their sisters sell pictures of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her creations from C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the magazine W@@ TV .
and in her free time she is in reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
&quot; congreg@@ ational Centers annually assign 160@@ ,000 people annually &quot;
&quot; more than 160@@ ,000 of the country &apos;s auxiliary conditions are rejected annually by the CE@@ Os , while the sector faces the impact of further aver@@ aging on already over@@ loaded transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Que@@ ens@@ land there are already three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ o@@ gi@@ ances and the like - with their request for free legal advice and legal assistance . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the municipality , which have already been exc@@ essively used , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; from June next year , it is planned that these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds . &quot;
&quot; the Director of Que@@ ens@@ land James Far@@ rel@@ l &apos;s Common Market Centr@@ es said that the last survey conducted by the National Association of Community Centr@@ es revealed , that thousands of people are rejected every year . &quot;
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would only get worse without removing the federal government &apos;s decision .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s Common Market Centr@@ es are chron@@ ically under@@ funded , which means that thousands of people of important services you need are rejected , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relationships , people with uns@@ ur@@ passed and oppres@@ sive debts , families who have been released through separ@@ ations , workers who have been released un@@ just - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need . &quot;
&quot; the federal government will cut funds by 30 percent as of June 2017 , which means that thousands of people in need from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; we call on the general prosec@@ utor and federal law ministers as well as sen@@ ators from Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to promptly raise these short@@ cuts , so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance to the national average . &quot;
&quot; it is now time to look at the needs of the community centers and their communities , and that the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k has invested in this important work . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp Ele@@ ction Campa@@ ign accused after workers allegedly drew a weapon
&quot; new York : Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s campaign has been charged with alleged in@@ action after being told that , in February , her campaign manager for North Carolina set up a gun for a staff while traveling in a je@@ ep in February . &quot;
&quot; the incident is described in an indictment filed by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i on Wednesday , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ordin@@ i admitted to have waited monthly for the matter to be resolved internally before he realised that &quot; &quot; this would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the campaign leader , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; pulled a gun , put his right finger on the trigger , and r@@ ammed the barrel in Vincent &apos;s knee , &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i gave in his indictment . &quot;
&quot; after compla@@ ining to the local and regional campaign management , B@@ ordin@@ i stated that at least four more persons had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he stated in the indictment . &quot;
&quot; weapons must not be fired to cause damage , &quot; &quot; said B@@ ord@@ i . &quot;
&quot; the indictment comes only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate released a tur@@ mo@@ il when he said to a crowd in North Carolina , that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - fire@@ arms owners and arms friends - should take action if his rival H@@ illary Clinton should be elected and appoint a judge . &quot;
Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s campaign made it clear that the media had torn its words out of context and that it would not inc@@ ite violence .
B@@ ordin@@ i complaint demands compensation from the campaign for breach of due diligence and Philip for bodily injury and lasting emotional damage .
&quot; Tru@@ mp@@ s Press spokesperson , Hope Hi@@ cks , was not to be reached for a statement . &quot;
attempts to contact Philip also failed .
&quot; W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer collabor@@ ator of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; calls to his consulting firm , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services , was not re@@ acted . &quot;
&quot; until now , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp has led a controversial campaign . &quot;

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before country elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
&quot; in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , there are considerable losses for the ruling party SPD and CD@@ U . &quot;
&quot; this yiel@@ ded representative surveys by the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot;
&quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition could continue to rule in the north , this is not possible after the survey data in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both federal states , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue to place the head of government . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD dropped from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent five years ago to 24 percent . &quot;
&quot; according to the survey , the party was only slightly ahead of the CD@@ U , which could rise to 23 per cent again . &quot;
the third place is controversial among the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; the left would be 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the country &apos;s parliament . &quot;
&quot; despite slight losses , the Gre@@ ens were reluct@@ ant to return to the Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag in spite of slight losses ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented in the Land@@ tag with 3 per cent .
&quot; according to the survey , the SPD of the survey was only 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) . &quot;
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
&quot; they are still behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
the Af@@ D would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties .
&quot; with 5 per cent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pirates would not miss the entry in contrast to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator came to the market .
the success@@ ors dominate the world today - its producer experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was thicker and larger , so it was not good in hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was quite cl@@ ums@@ y . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in memory initially was eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would be enough today for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone is now shipped with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ ytes .
&quot; the &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; came to business exactly 20 years ago , on August 15th , 1996 , and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few Euros , fans can still buy the equipment on the internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age . &quot;
&quot; 20 years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation . &quot;
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover as an office in the west pocket format .
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone could have a lot for those standards : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax the communic@@ ator was to be reached . &quot;
&quot; even the access to web pages was possible by HTML browsers , even if tor@@ menting slowly . &quot;
&quot; a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar . &quot;
&quot; there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop . &quot;
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
&quot; the price was quite proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , thus about 1400 euros . &quot;
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could suspect in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
&quot; since then , everything has been different . &quot;
smart phones are a success story if not for Nokia .
&quot; the Finn@@ s &apos; mobile phone segment experienced an unprecedented disaster , eventually sold to Microsoft and handled . &quot;
today providers dominate the market which came all a lot later than Nokia .
&quot; always and everywhere online , this is today for a lot of people everyday life . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide . &quot;
&quot; about 1.4 billion devices have been sold , and Samsung and Apple alone account for 5@@ 55 million units . &quot;
worldwide sales with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running business of the countless App providers and the telecommunications companies .
&quot; in the meantime , a whole industry has been created around the smartphone . &quot;
&quot; the decisive breakthrough on the mass market came first at the beginning of 2007 , at that time Apple boss Steve Jobs on the Mac world announced the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an Internet communic@@ ator , all easy to use via touch screen . &quot;
&quot; Apple &apos;s trium@@ phant success began , today the iPhone is the Group &apos;s most important product . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had a look . &quot;
&quot; finally , they disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot;
the sag@@ as now have Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung .
&quot; 20 years after his invention , the smartphone is a matter of course . &quot;
&quot; on average , every German looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; we all have to learn to take the Smartphone away , &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in the Siemens executive board of staff . &quot;
permanent availability is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must ste@@ er the Olympic spirit and extend He@@ ath@@ row
&quot; He@@ ath@@ row will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; for me , this was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just as in 2012 in London , when we had a great effort to ensure that all of our nations and regions benefited from the games . &quot;
the Olympics brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; we will already have 10,000 new apprentices@@ hips for our local communities alone , to create 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of the extension He@@ ath@@ row is too big . &quot;
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we &apos;ll be bl@@ aming on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to overcome but He@@ ath@@ row answers any asked question .
&quot; like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for single an infrastructure project . &quot;
&quot; expansion is a way to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 2@@ 11 billion in real estate growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both to the airport and to the UK . &quot;
&quot; we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from the T@@ 5 - the five years as a result of the world &apos;s best airport terminal , to T@@ 2 , which was built in the midst of the two most frequ@@ ented cat@@ walks in the world . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investments . &quot;
the London Games of 2012 were a big success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .

&quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; &quot; K@@ atz and mouse play &quot; &quot; regarding ad blocking &quot;
&quot; for companies that earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers try to b@@ ypass advertising block , a &quot; cat and mouse play . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that it would block sign@@ posting on its desktop site , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post in which it shared that users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertising in the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that its desktop site would change the encoding for its adver@@ ts to make it difficult to detect sign@@ aling restrictions on which part of the site is advertising . &quot;
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
&quot; in a blog post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her battle between the announ@@ cing open source community and the hang@@ ers has been underway since the invention of display lock@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook soon comes with a new solution . &quot;
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media has entered the fight is a strong indicator of how wor@@ rying displays have become the industry .
&quot; according to a study from the last year of Pa@@ ge@@ air and Adobe , approximately 200 million people worldwide use display lock@@ ers ; almost four times as much as 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 1.@@ 03 billion users daily running on Facebook about their mobile devices , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of the advertising revenue . &quot;
&quot; apart from the fact that mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and inst@@ ag@@ ram , there was a spokes@@ man . &quot;
&quot; advertising on desktop PCs makes a large proportion of revenues , so Facebook sees the investment of such a step as worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would be updating its &quot; &quot; ad preferences pool &quot; &quot; in order to have more control over it . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ block would be wor@@ rying about new filters because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising . &quot;
&quot; for the users , this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; shared a Facebook speaker in an email message . &quot;
&quot; ad block@@ ers are a stupid means , which is why we have focused on Develop@@ er tools like Ad Pre@@ ferences instead of putting more control into the hands of the people . &quot;
woman at presum@@ able suicide on a Swiss motorway
the victim lay in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police call witnesses after a woman was transferred to a motorway in the early morning hours on Thursday at a presum@@ able suicide of several vehicles on a motorway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
&quot; a woman lay in the dark &quot; in an act of despair &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a Swiss at the age of 49 , which was crossed by several vehicles , including a lor@@ ry , wanted to kill himself . &quot;
she still died on the spot .
&quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified , said the police , who called these as well as any witnesses of the incident to report . &quot;
&quot; an investig@@ ative procedure was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter shared the Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed . &quot;
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; this is something that the prosec@@ utor must decide , &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter . &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers are not responsible .
&quot; in each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the highway , it was decided that the drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian is running in the middle of the night on the free@@ way as it was in the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; last year a polic@@ ew@@ oman was acqu@@ itted of the casual murder , after having crossed and killed a man who was lying near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and has become unconscious on the street , took the judgment . &quot;
&quot; the court stated that the police -- who had responded to an emergency call -- drove in a justified way and that the presence of a man on the road was a &quot; &quot; completely unusual and un@@ predictable situation &quot; , &quot; said the judge . &quot;
anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA Climate model : Venus was once hab@@ itable
&quot; according to projections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was probably inhabited once . &quot;
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies at NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble those of climate scientists .
&quot; the model was designed to determine whether Venus could once have revealed similar conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere . &quot;
scientists have previously indicated that the slow revolution of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , ear@@ then @-@ like atmosphere and still turned out slowly . &quot;
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably referred to more dry areas than de Earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to host lives and protected from quick evap@@ oration . &quot;
the early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow revolution of Venus exhibits its day @-@ side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like a umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat . &quot;
the result is average temperatures that are some degree cooler than that of the Earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus that resembles evolution that was previously suspected of planetary scientists .
&quot; although it was presumably inhab@@ itable , Venus -- in the course of several billions years --@@ was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light . &quot;
their oceans evap@@ or@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was burnt away by ultra@@ violet light .
&quot; as their hydro@@ gen , there remained only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , which as we know it today . &quot;
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus Climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy performs as trainer of Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy retired as trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che on Thursday and led to a lesser degree of co @-@ determination in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
&quot; alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately look for a new coach . &quot;
&quot; in the last three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in the course of summer , I have been thinking about how I could improve this team to give it more depth , it needs and bring it to a higher level . &quot;
&quot; in order to achieve this , the Vision of the Train@@ ers and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to that of the organization . &quot;
it must also have a right to co @-@ determination in decisions affecting the performance of the team .
these conditions are not met at the moment .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , who had been hired by Roy on May 23 , 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team . &quot;
&quot; today Patrick informed me about this decision , &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot;
we appreciate all that he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future .
Roy was awarded the Best Trainer of the League during his debut season at the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 in the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 .
&quot; he led the club to 112 points and ranked first in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed the late season in each of the last two years . &quot;
the Aval@@ an@@ ches marked a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 mark in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the wild for a second wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference by five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadi@@ ans and the Aval@@ an@@ che .
&quot; North America workers resume talks , put on strike &quot;
&quot; the labour struggles concerning the remuneration for the North Sea oil workers are suspended , while all the parties sit on the table for a new round of discussion , said negoti@@ ators . &quot;
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were spor@@ adi@@ cally carried out on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; the Wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to re @-@ start the winding process of the current strike , &quot; says it in a joint statement . &quot;
we will keep some full @-@ day sessions in the coming weeks that will start at the beginning of next year in order to restart the problems .
&quot; the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in more than 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; this year , Wood Group cut rates to its counter@@ parts in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure . &quot;
the company &apos;s ratings are followed by a 10 % drop in on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts give the company the needed space to get through the market down@@ turn .
&quot; Shell has released thousands of people and announced plans to give up its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , as its business activities are ration@@ alised as a result of its meg@@ ac@@ re@@ union with the British energy company BG Group . &quot;
&quot; energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , an economic situation which was reinforced by the decision of the British in June to leave the European Union . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week , the Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson met with workers &quot; leaders to discuss one of the biggest industrial disputes ever held in the North Sea . &quot;
&quot; the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said . &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not just a few , &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion of spending on new projects in the North Sea are expected to be around $ 7 billion in the last five years . &quot;

&quot; the new data help astronom@@ ers understand why stars in the star @-@ pile rotate to different rates , as well as in what connection the rotation @-@ time periods are with the planet origin . &quot;
&quot; we hope that through comparing our results with other con@@ stell@@ ations , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades is 4@@ 45 light years from the Earth .
&quot; many stars in this con@@ stellation , which originated some 125 million years ago , are now reaching adul@@ th@@ ood . &quot;
it is now the fastest way to rotate .
&quot; at peak rotation rates , these mature stars rep@@ el large amounts of star@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; since these winds travel through the stars &quot; magnetic fields , they have a braking effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star is aging , its rotation rate begins to slow down . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by real@@ ising the time between the appearance of a visible star spot -- like sun@@ spots -- .
the latest catalogue of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars are rotating more slowly than less massive stars .
&quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars appearing slower pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very light stars , &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; as the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal Cos@@ mic Laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rotation rates . &quot;
&quot; the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; we would like to learn more about how , when and why stars slow down their rotation rates , and so to speak , hang out their &quot; dancing shoes . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in three newspaper reports , Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported in detail about their latest analysis of the Ple@@ j@@ aden &apos;s rotation rates , which will soon be published in the Astronom@@ ical Journal . &quot;
a controversial bas@@ eball @-@ star ki@@ cks off
the tears ran faster with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez than the US bas@@ eball @-@ star in the best days of Base to Base .
&quot; after his emotional res@@ ignation , the 41 year old pro will wear the Tri@@ k@@ ot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es on August 12 against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say goodbye to Goo@@ db@@ ye , &quot; said the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star Game Parti@@ cip@@ ant of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; three times , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was elected the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot;
&quot; since 2007 , his signature under a ten @-@ year contract gave him 27 million US dollars a year . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the contract on December 31 , 2017 , he will be acting as consultant and youth coach in future - with full salary . &quot;
as a player it paid Rodri@@ gu@@ ez back for a long time with performance .
&quot; with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Navy ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es managed to make some mil@@ estones . &quot;
&quot; with Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two other bas@@ eball players have similar values in the most important statistics . &quot;
&quot; however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should nevertheless not be included in the Ruh@@ mes@@ halle of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; - was in the field , so controversial is his appearance outside the square . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , the super@@ star was admitted to &quot; ES@@ PN , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 banned ster@@ oids . &quot;
&quot; in August 2013 , he was closed for 2@@ 11 games due to the involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal until the end of 2014 . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered to be the main suspect for years to have received high @-@ performance funds via an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
&quot; after a legal dispute , the lock was reduced to 162 encounters . &quot;
&quot; the league could have done a favor for the year 2014 because I played for 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez back then . &quot;
also his farewell @-@ days are not silent .
&quot; while many bas@@ eball players still get the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench . &quot;
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job involves the attempt to win every game , &quot; et@@ ched Yan@@ ke@@ es coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di . &quot;
&quot; after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married with the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and told the relationship with Pop@@ star Madonna and the act@@ ress K@@ ate Hudson , was re @-@ said , sympathy @-@ friend@@ ships of the fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ Erz@@ riv@@ ale Boston Red So@@ x . &quot;
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; the supporters sang at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team . &quot;
&quot; Olympics 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases &quot;
&quot; caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing test , weight lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland must not start in Rio . &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing cases .
an experienced ath@@ lete would have won almost a medal .
&quot; before the seventh competition date , the first official dop@@ ing cases have become known to the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter obstacle @-@ runners in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and Polish Wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested and excluded - immediately before the start of the critically acclaimed Ath@@ le@@ tics competitions this news comes to an end . &quot;
&quot; in Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de was already proven last Sunday , which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances . &quot;
&quot; on Friday afternoon , the International Sports Court CA@@ S confirmed its expul@@ sion from the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took fourth place in the final about 100 m of butter@@ flies , just around 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en should have participated in the courses over 50 m Fre@@ estyle . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) has requested the opening of the B @-@ sample and a hearing .
&quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; very serious and requires full cooperation in the investigations , &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; we will work together with the International Sports Court of CA@@ S and will accept the judgement . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history , no longer the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S is responsible for the san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; also in the night of Rio , the news of the positive rehear@@ sal le@@ aked at Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on to the offensive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; said the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; she was innocent , &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; said the ath@@ lete . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , it is intended to act in the banned substance around the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O . &quot;
&quot; thanks to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample should have already been positive . &quot;
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ y@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v immediately reported to the ath@@ lete with criticism .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the sports@@ men don &apos;t draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot;
&quot; for example , all wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing nation should not take part in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday the case was also known as &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski , &quot; the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested positively on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon three days earlier than his brother Tom@@ as@@ z . &quot;
&quot; both are denied taking , but they are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; before the athletes &apos; start , a further heavy blow for the reputation of the whole sport is particularly the case . &quot;
&quot; the world association IA@@ AF had banned the whole Russian team up to an exception because of systematic dop@@ ing , also the L@@ äu@@ er nation Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the swimming sport , the earlier off@@ ences in China also caused violent clas@@ hes among athletes . &quot;
so the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Y@@ ang Har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt purple . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium over 200 m Fre@@ estyle , I want to hand over , &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t on the French radio . &quot;
sun was also at the centre of a confrontation with the Australian M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing che@@ aters , &quot; &quot; said . &quot;
&quot; sun had been positively tested by the Chinese champi@@ onships in 2014 on the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ one , but had to sit down only a three @-@ month lock . &quot;
Dat@@ ak@@ lau : so per@@ fi@@ de er@@ pressing h@@ ack@@ ers its ran@@ som
programmers of black@@ mail malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful in doing so .
&quot; according to a recent survey by the malware defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes among 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the surv@@ eyed companies in the past twelve months have at least once , some multiple victims of an attack with black@@ mail software . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , nearly 20 percent of the companies were already the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware solution . &quot;
40 percent of victims readily paid the ran@@ som demanded by the perpetr@@ ators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data .
the perpetr@@ ators speci@@ alize their black@@ mail software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes to attack attacks in company networks .
&quot; if they are successful there , the potential to black@@ mail money is significantly higher than with private users . &quot;
&quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of the malware , &quot; says Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes manager Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most of the mal@@ war@@ e@@ programmes were designed to send advertising . &quot;
then the perpetr@@ ators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
&quot; first of all , private users were the target , but the change to company attacks was terri@@ fying in the past few months . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once active on a victim &apos;s computer , it searches for recently modified files such as Word@@ - , Excel or database files , as well as archives of pictures and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and er@@ ases the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
the software then presents the recei@@ v@@ ables of the black@@ mail .
&quot; to get the final key code to the files , the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of the Cryp@@ to@@ state Bit@@ coin . &quot;
&quot; but where private users use the personal photo database on the game , companies are dealing with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production is shut down . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the damage occurs when a ran@@ som@@ ware hits . &quot;
&quot; 22 percent of the affected German companies reported sales losses due to Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 per cent even had to break the business activity completely , in one case people were in danger of life . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , several hospitals have already been victims of attacks , whose patients can be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records . &quot;
&quot; we always say to the victims : don &apos;t pay , you only promote the problem , &quot; K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski explains . &quot;
&quot; however , 80 to 90 percent of companies pay their data again . &quot;
&quot; for managers , it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetr@@ ators in the face of stagn@@ ation in the company . &quot;
the h@@ ack@@ ers in turn know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
&quot; in a recent study , the safety researchers of F @-@ Secure have examined the user surfaces and contact with the black@@ mail and comes to the conclusion : the perpetr@@ ators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money . &quot;
&quot; they tell their victims per chat how they can pay per Bit@@ coin , set up freely accessible support websites or de@@ cryp@@ t free sample files for free . &quot;
&quot; and will private individuals receive payments of a few hundred euros , companies must negotiate hard@@ ships and pay five @-@ digit sums to get their data un@@ encrypted . &quot;
&quot; given the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky gains from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , the h@@ ack@@ ers become more and more professional and share the work , declares Security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from antivirus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware roughly within a week . &quot;
&quot; however , it is more likely that it is three or four persons . &quot;
the programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software modular system to the actual black@@ mail .
&quot; the existing malware kits were created by buying the malware , providing advice and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; delivery includes an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the black@@ mail is then looking for further h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
&quot; so you log in one of the boards on the underground , buy the set from a criminal and instruc@@ t another to install the software on as many PCs as possible . &quot;
payment is made per registered machine .
&quot; usually the criminals then proc@@ ure sp@@ amm@@ ers with the spread , &quot; &quot; declares Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the risk of ran@@ som@@ ware is well @-@ known for many companies that provide better protection of their data . &quot;
more than 50 percent of the companies IT managers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey rely on sh@@ oring up ran@@ som@@ ware by file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanner software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful black@@ out , the perpetr@@ ators are threatening the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes @-@ chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; this means that , depending on the type of data , the damage potential is much higher than before . &quot;
&quot; in the future , the perpetr@@ ators could also take completely new targets on the internet of things on the grain . &quot;
&quot; at the &quot; &quot; Hack@@ ers Conference &quot; &quot; , the security researchers demonstrated how to get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the winter , the activation of such a blocked heating could certainly be worth a ran@@ som . &quot;
&quot; if the perpetr@@ ators then instead of heating in the future block an entire production line in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
&quot; Honda wants to pack everything in the small HR @-@ V : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é and even the versatility of a mini@@ van . &quot;
&quot; sounds pretty much over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which has been constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear , it doesn &apos;t work in any place . &quot;
&quot; the materials of the interior are well finished and have a pleasant effect , only the cockpit top is falling down somewhat . &quot;
more versatile than comparable cars is the HR @-@ V in the storage box .
&quot; there is not only a trunk of 4@@ 53 l in case of high @-@ featured and 10@@ 26 l in case of retro@@ fit back rests , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like cinema chairs and thus offer storage space , which is 1,@@ 24 m high from the floor to ceiling . &quot;
&quot; the trunk can be loaded well , however , the loading height with 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
the 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide rpm ranges .
&quot; however , he should do something qui@@ eter in his work . &quot;
pleasing is the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km .
there is another engine : a 1.5 litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
a four @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynam@@ ism and comfort . &quot;
but the steering is likely to be somewhat more direct .
&quot; in the top @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art &quot; Executive , &quot; the equipment leaves nothing to be desired . &quot;
&quot; the safety systems include the City emergency brake assistant ( works up to speed 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane support assistant . &quot;
&quot; the collision warning sometimes irrit@@ ates , because he evalu@@ ates many obstacles as &quot; &quot; approaching objects &quot; &quot; when manoeu@@ v@@ ring . &quot;
the high @-@ beam assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent speed control re@@ acts to the traffic sign detection and th@@ rot@@ tles the speed if required .
&quot; but the full connectivity is only available for the top features : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation device , app integration and more . &quot;
two USB and one HDMI connector lie under the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat cum@@ ber@@ some to achieve .
&quot; the roughly 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine . &quot;
&quot; those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will receive the gasoline engine from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
&quot; with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car . &quot;
Air@@ line is not liable : fall on passenger jet@@ ty
an airline is not liable for the down@@ fall of a passenger on the passenger jet@@ ty .
the Higher Regional Court of Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) ar@@ gues that liability is only conceivable if there are dangers that are typical of air transport .
the pla@@ inti@@ ff had broken a knee stroke during the fall .
&quot; the accident , however , could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , such as the court . &quot;
the airline had to pay no damages to the man .
case of illness : when the organis@@ er pays
&quot; after their trip , people who have fallen ill receive only money when the cause of the disease can be found without doubt in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; however , this is only the case when more than ten percent of the guests show the same symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the trial , a family was severely ill with diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting on the second day of their doors . &quot;
she spent almost the entire vacation in the room .
&quot; their disease caused the vac@@ ation@@ ers to return to a defective sewage treatment plant , which allegedly poll@@ uted sea@@ water . &quot;
the family felt that the trip had been defici@@ ent - and compla@@ ined against the organis@@ er .
the pla@@ inti@@ ffs had no success in court .
&quot; indeed , the pla@@ inti@@ ff was indeed defective . &quot;
&quot; however , the Organ@@ izer learned about it just before leaving the pla@@ inti@@ ff . &quot;
until then he had to assume that the sea water was fine .
&quot; so he did not viol@@ ate his duty of information , so the judgment . &quot;
especially since no im@@ puri@@ ties were found in the samples of water .
the illness of several hotel guests - possibly by con@@ ta@@ gion among themselves - belong to the general risk of life .
&quot; of 6@@ 91 guests , only 38 were ill . &quot;
&quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère said , after the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people were worried about further attacks . &quot;
the state must be pru@@ dent and determined to react to terror haz@@ ards at the same time .
&quot; certainly , our country will not answer the violence of the perpetr@@ ators with hatred and cle@@ av@@ age . &quot;
we won &apos;t grant this triumph to the terrorists .
&quot; if offen@@ ders would have to leave the country faster , it will increase security and strength also the approval of the population for refugee policy . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère seeks to implement the proposals until the 2017 Bundestag election .
&quot; he also announced further personnel rein@@ for@@ cements of the security forces , namely &quot; in a medium @-@ four scale order over several years . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; sympathy for terrorism needs to be punished again . &quot;
&quot; video surveillance should be improved , the weapon &apos;s right to be amended so that the purchase of weapons on the Internet is more difficult . &quot;
&quot; the last much deb@@ ated sec@@ rec@@ y for doctors , according to de Mai@@ zi@@ ères , should be maintained in words . &quot;
&quot; however , in dialogue with the medical profession he wants to seek solutions , how the endanger@@ ing of the citizens could be reduced , he said , with a view of psych@@ ic ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; in order to counter@@ act the radic@@ alisation of refugees , the minister keeps a better social support necessary . &quot;
teachers would have to be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mati@@ zed people .
&quot; to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the use of hidden investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; the SPD is prepared to talk about everything that will help to improve security . &quot;
it is important that the Minister of the Interior said clearly against Action@@ ism .
&quot; this was an ear@@ nest for the sni@@ per in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; said Gabriel to the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Media Group ( Friday ) . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union after a ban on the Bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of the double nationality .
a general ban on full @-@ wear is un@@ constitutional for the constitu@@ tionally un@@ constitutional .
&quot; one cannot ban everything that is borrow@@ ed , and I oppose wearing the bur@@ ka . &quot;
talk about rules about road traffic or for witnesses in court .
green Princip@@ al in Sim@@ one Peter repro@@ ached the minister to simulate action and ability to act with ever @-@ new anti @-@ terror packages .
&quot; left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ wi@@ inger said : &quot; fleet of spra@@ yers and a sharpen@@ ing of the right of residence bring people in this country no more security . &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway exit
it st@@ alls regularly on the b@@ ypass road - here is a picture of November .
&quot; however , this should change : the right @-@ wing was@@ p should be extended . &quot;
this is a good news for all car drivers who are driving in traffic on the environmental street every night in traffic jam if they drive over the motorway to Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
&quot; on the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) , the road construction industry extends the right lane by 700 meters between the Hammer Street and the exit Wes@@ er Straße . &quot;
drivers can then jump right from the hammer street on the right .
&quot; the big advantage : the traffic is sharing early on , thereby improving the overall sequence on the busy section of the federal road 51 . &quot;
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district of Münster @-@ West .
the road nar@@ rowing on the feeder is annoying the drivers above all between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
&quot; on week@@ days , the back@@ stage goes up to the bridge over the Alber@@ ian Way and sometimes beyond . &quot;
reason is the needle &apos;s eye on the B 51 shortly before the exit Wes@@ er Straße .
&quot; from here , traffic is only directed one lane through the motorway bridge . &quot;
the second track had to be built back three @-@ three years ago .
&quot; the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer possesses the necessary load capacity , in order to absorb the heavy @-@ load traffic in two lanes . &quot;
&quot; as long as this bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and the associated factory @-@ daily traffic will continue , the responsible state company cannot say . &quot;
&quot; however , it has to be reck@@ oned with years : the bridge has an official residual term until 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the rule of law , the state company deliberately chose the more traffic @-@ less time during the school holidays , because with disabilities there is to be reck@@ oned with . &quot;
traffic will be guided on the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday .
intercultural Travel : cultural Activities for Schools
the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the theatre piece &quot; The In@@ visible House . &quot;
the N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theatre are now planning a music project .
N@@ ima &apos;s society enables young people with migration and refugee backgrounds to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; class International &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has attended a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; The In@@ visible House &quot; &quot; of the boy theater Münster . &quot;
&quot; in the context of &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; initiated by the society N@@ ima &apos;s &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; 19 students between eleven and 15 years visited the production in the little house . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee backgrounds , has the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster , as part of this project . &quot;
&quot; most of the youth of the class had come to Münster from September 2015 to March 2016 , among others from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria and spoke little German . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic pictures and video animations it was possible for them to follow the course of action , thus the press release of the boy theater Münster . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg from Spra@@ kel , and the Young Theatre will work together in the coming season as part of a musical theatre project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December , teenagers with and without escape and migration background should get the opportunity to attend professionally instructed courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music . &quot;
offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theatrical language mediation are in planning .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
&quot; in view of the increased number of refugees , the association expects many classes to participate . &quot;
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for improvement of weather
the weather has made the Stern@@ schn@@ u@@ ppen Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the southwest of Germany on the night a stroke through the bill - but there is still hope .
&quot; the night was badly suited for clouds and rain to watch the heavenly spectacle , said the chairman of the Stern@@ warte Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning . &quot;
our hope is on the night of Saturday .
&quot; the weather should be good , then we &apos;ll see many shooting stars in the sky . &quot;
&quot; the shooting stars are Per@@ sei@@ ds , which are one of the fastest star sni@@ pp@@ ets at 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour . &quot;
&quot; they have their name , because they appear to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the north @-@ east . &quot;
relaxing night : tips against sleep disorders
&quot; in the evening you roll around forever , at night you lie awake for hours ; in the morning , there is no longer thinking of sleep before the wake @-@ up ring . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; after all , one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of the adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing . &quot;
how do sleep problems or sleep problems manifest ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many causes behind them , emphasizes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eder , member of the board member of the German Society for sleep control and sleeping medicine . &quot;
&quot; what one understands for the moment , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , that is , an inhal@@ ation and sleep distur@@ b@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; as a result of sleep , many people feel as uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , member of the board of the German House Medical Association with practice in the lower Saxony Var@@ el . &quot;
what &apos;s behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
&quot; behind it can be organic , mental or behavi@@ oral factors , but also drugs . &quot;
in@@ frequently sleep distur@@ b@@ ance is an expression of another disease .
&quot; very early awakening is common in depression , &quot; says We@@ eder . &quot;
and it can be that different factors require one another .
&quot; for example , who has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can lie poorly , w@@ akes up every two to three hours , and possibly starts to pon@@ der about everyday problems and worries , there is an example . &quot;
&quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
when should you become a doctor with in@@ som@@ nia ?
those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week should go to the doctor .
&quot; the impair@@ ment may look quite different : one is beaten , tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical complaints such as stomach or head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; to relieve sleep distur@@ b@@ ance , it is important to find out their causes . &quot;
&quot; treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or medication - classic sleep tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks . &quot;
&quot; there is hardly any left @-@ handed sleep medicine in Germany , stressed Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary dormit@@ ory medical center of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , one should first turn to the primary doctor in case of sleep problems , but he advises . &quot;
it can be resolved with research whether the problems have a physical cause .
&quot; who should go to sleep , and what happens ? &quot;
&quot; for example , for snor@@ ing with breathing drop@@ outs , for example in snor@@ ing with breathing drop@@ outs , for abnormal fatigue , in sleep transform@@ ers or if one does not find the cause of a sleep distur@@ b@@ ance , it explains fi@@ st@@ iness . &quot;
it is not necessary to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; please don &apos;t make a n@@ ap , &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
after the sc@@ aling one goes to bed at his normal time .
&quot; in addition to the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose @-@ glasses , a chest strap and a fe@@ eler at the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera records the sleeping @-@ ends at the ceiling . &quot;
how can those affected get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of adjusting screws you can use for a better sleep .
&quot; we@@ eds count on : regular sleep and down@@ time , not lying too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , do not watch TV to sleep , avoid alcohol and not watch at night at night - then you start calcul@@ ating immediately , and that &apos;s not condu@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ tem@@ e expressed himself via Facebook for the dis@@ ap@@ pointing cutting of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ us .
&quot; in December 2014 , he made gold for the first time at the Kurz@@ bahn World Championships in Doh@@ a and at the same time presented his first world record . &quot;
&quot; now , the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ lete Markus Dei@@ tem@@ e has placed himself in front of his ex @-@ team@@ mates standing in the cri@@ tique . &quot;
&quot; in a country where an Olympic winner receives 20.000 € premium and a jungle king of € 150@@ ,000 , nobody should be surprised about missing medals , &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old on the night on his Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; the pumping system in the swimming sport is bad , the dop@@ ing controls , on the other hand , are very good . &quot;
this means that we can &apos;t compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look closely at the subject of dop@@ ing or even operate it .
&quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls should be stopped here , &quot; &quot; he explained . &quot;
&quot; if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ r had to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot;
this is exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; who cannot be controlled for a certain time before WM / OS of independent controllers of WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not take part , &quot; demands the choice ham@@ burger , who meanwhile operates an ice cream par@@ lor . &quot;
airport : arrest of baggage thi@@ eves
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
&quot; on Thursday , the arrest of two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 took place on Thursday . &quot;
the susp@@ ects had committed several bags and baggage @-@ ste@@ els as a gang .
&quot; at 21.@@ 30 o &apos;clock , civilian officials in the airport of Düsseldorf recognised a gang that was known to polic@@ emen from past thi@@ eves . &quot;
&quot; the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since mid @-@ July and were in the process of community , labour and especially professional . &quot;
&quot; the specialists of the crime comm@@ iss@@ ariat 34 can prove four actions to the thi@@ eves , who have entered Germany specifically for the arrest of criminal off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; in total , they had over 15,000 Euros . &quot;
&quot; old buildings , some lin@@ den trees , in between there is still a rest of cob@@ ble@@ stones : the Riga street in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in doesn &apos;t seem so at first sight , but the police count them to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; if one walks along the road from east to west , one passes play@@ grounds , a newly painted kinder@@ garten and a bike . &quot;
&quot; on the facade of a grey house , someone has spra@@ yed &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; &quot;
&quot; compared to a Li@@ dl , which is to be demol@@ ished soon , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here until 2017 . &quot;
&quot; however , in recent weeks articles about this &quot; &quot; trendy neighborhood &quot; , &quot; as the competent real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in , are fav@@ ored with burning cars . &quot;
&quot; the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , the residents now have rental agreements , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin interior sen@@ ator Henkel has spoken several times for a hard approach by the police against the project , the area referred to as &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; on 22 June , the rooms on the ground floor , the cad@@ a@@ for@@ ge , with 300 police officers , pat@@ ro@@ gated the police for three weeks , according to official statements , with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site , locked off parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94 . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , building workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown home@@ owners . &quot;
&quot; on 13 July , a Berlin administrative court ruled that the clearance had been illegal and a day later police and construction workers moved under the jubil@@ ation of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon , the street works peac@@ efully : parents go for a walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others talk about late late . &quot;
&quot; in the immediate vicinity of the house projects , there is a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens . &quot;
&quot; left violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in Kie@@ z since 1999 , and Jan@@ a * , who has three children here , are mainly stressed by the police presence . &quot;
&quot; with the inhabitants of the house projects , they share the concern for increasing r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; it does not sound like a Kie@@ z , who wished mostly police protection against v@@ and@@ ali@@ atory lef@@ ti@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin interior sen@@ ator and the police open between house occup@@ iers and their neighbors , obviously does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Friedrichsha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working @-@ class district , which , in comparison to the rest of the city , has a lower average income and a high risk of poverty . &quot;
&quot; in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer Strasse in the vicinity of the Riga . &quot;
&quot; while the Mainz was cleared by a large police force in a regular street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Riga and are still inhabited by the people they had occupied 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the neighborhood has become a magnet for tourists and choice liners from all over the world over the past few years : residents from GDR times and former home @-@ owned land@@ owners share their neighbourhood with them . &quot;
&quot; this is also reflected in the r@@ ents , which have increased by almost 60 per cent since 2009 . &quot;
many of the new buildings in the R@@ ī@@ ga are attacked as symbols for this development : they recognize them on thrown slices or freshly painted faç@@ ades thrown with dy@@ es .
no other road was mentioned this year together with the words &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; one reason for not all neighbours to view this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crime , such as bodily injury , are almost exclusively directed against polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; most of the off@@ ences make material damage , which tend to meet the new buildings and newly renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has lived in a rental house next to the disputed 94 for 17 years , uncertainty cannot be of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; as far as violence is concerned , it is important : the people in the 94 are their neighbours who have not been this . &quot;
even the famous burning cars no longer exist in the R@@ ī@@ ga .
&quot; for the studied architect , her street is not a criminal focus , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the road and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliberately drawn into the Riga street - and remained .
&quot; that is why it was also so important that people get back to their streets : from police , politics and media , which in July all suddenly claimed the interpretation sovereignty over the district . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of residents such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the street will continue to be taken away : by fac@@ eless new buildings in former building spaces that the old inhabitants sup@@ plant . &quot;
&quot; in the end they are con@@ domini@@ ums which are not interesting for many here - here people live rather people who are not so good , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; I absolutely cannot appro@@ ve of violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what can you do if someone never list@@ ens to it ?
&quot; there is fru@@ stration on all sides , including the police and residents . &quot;
&quot; Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for dra@@ ins who are anno@@ yed about color bombs , the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z . &quot;
&quot; who draws , should be aware of it - just like someone who prefers a pub to complain about noise there . &quot;
all individuals presented with first names have asked not to be called by their right name .
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee commission@@ er
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in matters of integration and organis@@ er .
&quot; in addition , she is a social worker on site . &quot;
&quot; since July , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee commission@@ er for Ur@@ bach . &quot;
the social pedago@@ gue supports the team of management for Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; she sees herself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , working groups refugee aid , administration , authorities and anyone else . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine Customer of the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the ei@@ ving wool @-@ milk @-@ sau , which above all has a problem . &quot;
&quot; for example , some - less ridi@@ cul@@ ing than much rather than the multitude of desired areas - meant that the administration wanted to write down the job . &quot;
&quot; an administrative faculty with a talent for languages and people , coupled with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , has been sought . &quot;
&quot; but administrative work is not its central area , meaning Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; above all , it is about organization , work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activities . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent position on three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full actors . &quot;
&quot; there are big and small problems , organizational , human and communication problems . &quot;
new containers will soon be placed in the Was@@ en@@ straße
it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees who have been recognized .
the municipalities are responsible for the connection provision .
you must bring the refugees in their own or hired living rooms .
&quot; the costs for the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the commun@@ es themselves . &quot;
the responsibility changes from the district council to the commune and job center .
&quot; problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment . &quot;
the search has been very difficult for some time .
&quot; de facto , the administration does not find private apartments . &quot;
&quot; it didn &apos;t work so far , it was necessary to rely on private dwell@@ ings , so Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , common dwell@@ ings must be in@@ timi@@ dated as it is so beautiful . &quot;
new containers will soon be erected in the Was@@ en@@ straße .
&quot; but only with apartments , it is not done . &quot;
&quot; perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a permanent residence there are intern@@ ships , apprentices@@ hips , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and backup activities for refugees and migrants who need to be wounded or set up . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; Reg@@ ine customer reports . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building yard or help house@@ wives , do char@@ itable work - and that motiv@@ ates and very ti@@ dy , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports . &quot;
she hopes that working for the community leads to a positive external effect .
&quot; this is &quot; &quot; no job therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
&quot; the day needs a solid structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer . &quot;
people would have to develop a feeling of belonging .
&quot; so I need offers like sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses . &quot;
professional courses are rare .
&quot; so here , administration and volunteers are also jumping . &quot;
it is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; they have to explain the refugees that it takes a long time to bridge over time , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; those who develop the feeling sometime , can &apos;t help in Ur@@ bach , do not work and be useless , he will never be able to integrate . &quot;
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; but there is also problem cases , says customer honestly , &quot; people with nothing at all . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
all this is already a mam@@ mot@@ h task .
&quot; a difficult question : do the two have fear of radic@@ alisation after the recent occur@@ ren@@ ces , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine customer says clearly , &quot; &quot; what some na@@ ï@@ ve might call . &quot; &quot; a residual risk could and does not want to exclude them . &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these incidents are also subject to the refugees .
they would have the fear that the assass@@ ins kill them completely .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; thus , the main and honorary official must look for activities in the region and in the region . &quot;
they always have in the background that a new push to refugees and migrants will soon come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a cap ?
&quot; to answer this question clearly , politics is afraid . &quot;
&quot; actually , it is unfair to put them hel@@ pers on the spot . &quot;
&quot; we haven &apos;t arrived in Ur@@ bach where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; no new refugees , that would relax the situation . &quot;
Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bach are already busy to integrate the previous people sensi@@ bly .
&quot; these are currently around 100 people , mostly young men . &quot;
&quot; but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree . &quot;
&quot; the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers . &quot;
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : looking for break@@ ers with helicop@@ ters
the police helicopter flew several areas for about an hour - un@@ successful .
two unknown men are forci@@ bly forced into an apartment in a multi @-@ family house on Friday morning at 8.@@ 50 am .
the inhabit@@ ant surprised the two and struck the dis@@ b@@ ust in flight .
&quot; the two men were about 1.@@ 65 to 1.@@ 70 meters large , probably escaped , wore both Blue@@ jeans and black hoo@@ ded pul@@ ses . &quot;
they fled to the city centre .
&quot; in order to prosec@@ ute the police , police put several stri@@ des and a police helicopter . &quot;
the gro@@ unding went without success .
&quot; perhaps the unknown people fell in front of the apartment , respectively when they fled . &quot;
