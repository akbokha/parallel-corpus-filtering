<seg id="1">Golfer Langer receives the Sports Pyramid</seg>
<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">"at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer was looking for a little change with some colleagues on the beach."</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "gold Sports Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">"after a few minutes, the horses remembered their holiday, they chased at home in the fast gallop home to the food roughs."</seg>
<seg id="7">"one kilometer at that speed, I was afraid."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," Langer says. "</seg>
<seg id="9">And so the riding career ended again.</seg>
<seg id="10">"on Saturday, Germany's best golfer was - 101 tournament victories - again in the vicinity of horses."</seg>
<seg id="11">"he had his family run over the complex of the ALRV, he did not even swear by a horse for photographic purposes."</seg>
<seg id="12">Long was the first time in Aachen and thus also at CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the German sporting aid handed over the man from Anhausen during a small gala, the Golden Sports Pyramid."</seg>
<seg id="15">There is no lack of distinctions for the sympathetic athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Federal Cross of Merit, Silver Laurel leaf, Champions Tour Player of the year..."</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen has already begged him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 18th winner of the Sports Pyramid is long.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Aachen he met the first laureate Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="20">"this award means a lot to me," says Langer, "because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements, but also for social commitment."</seg>
<seg id="21">"for decades, Langer has been promoting young talents."</seg>
<seg id="22">"and so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="23">"with 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time U.S. master winner was added to the" Hall of Fame of German Sports "on Saturday."</seg>
<seg id="24">"the results are the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Fechter Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Ruderer Peter-Michael Kolbe, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the rider Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumously the Handballer Erhard Wunderlich."</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of these sportsmen came to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after the official part, the illustrious company moved to the Springstadion where the Lavazza prize went."</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton's and Trumps economic policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Both Clinton and Trump want to invest in infrastructure and prevent TTP trading agreements.</seg>
<seg id="3">"however, the two US presidential contestants are unequal in tax and energy policy, as well as in a fundamental issue."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the difference in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, rather philosophical distinction."</seg>
<seg id="5">Of the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "Trump wants to keep this in doubt rather small and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says."</seg>
<seg id="8">"he himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, says Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will massively go back on regulation, and he is committed to a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and businesses."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton, on the other hand, says: the state has to fulfil certain tasks, it has opportunities to open disadvantaged opportunities and needs money."</seg>
<seg id="11">"for this reason, taxes would be increased for the rich," "she says."</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to the subject of infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in the future, Trump and Clinton say almost word-like."</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate states the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state-critical Teaparty wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">"so, on Trump, there could still be party-internal discussions."</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are more clearly evident.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump intends to build coal-fired power plants and re-establish coal mining in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="19">"oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas, and he wants to cancel the Paris Climate Protection Agreement."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Clinton, on the other hand, wants to explicitly expand the renewable energy with its investment programme:" "a country will create the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"but not only in infrastructure, but also in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the transpiratory trade agreement, both do not want to sign."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, both of them don't want to isolate the US from international trade - they just want to protect American jobs better."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they should be paid better, Clinton says."</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a famine.</seg>
<seg id="27">He wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must rise, then he says he must not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand, Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">"his critics inform him, that the budget deficit would only be greater."</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand Clinton, who wants at least from the rich wants to pay more taxes, and whose critics say: more taxes are not the solution either."</seg>

<seg id="1">Flight: "every winged woman has experiences with sexual violence"</seg>
<seg id="2">"sexual violence is a part of women who are fleeing alone, almost to everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="3">"when they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized."</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a large kitchen four women sit.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each one has a baby at the most one year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put her little son in his arms.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looks curiously in the room with big eyes.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother stares on the table-top.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until she notices that she is being watched.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles and kisses the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene seems normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Talking to Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"she is the Business Manager of Condrobs, a sponsor for social welfare services in Bavaria, and deals with the issue of women on the run."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are fowl.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralized shelters for all-forced women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in January, Condrobs opened the institution together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid."</seg>
<seg id="18">"recently, it was officially opened."</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are no men - not as a visitor either.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guard in front of the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who arrives here has experiences with sexual violence on her flight," "says Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="23">"men are fleeing because of wars because they are persecuted politically, because they threaten to torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as a ray of hope," "she says."</seg>
<seg id="24">"women outweigh other reasons for the escape:" "many steal away secretly because they see no other way out."</seg>
<seg id="25">"in their home country they have experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, frees, slavery or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">This is what drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">"on the run, this goes on."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the fact that tugs are demanding a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a rarity," "says Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and the women are alone, they are not protected by their families."</seg>
<seg id="30">"who believes that the end, as soon as they anchor in Germany, misses, tells Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="31">"here too, single women in refugee shelters would often be considered inferior and abused in the worst case."</seg>
<seg id="32">"this means that about 90 percent of women living in the north of Munich are traumatized, they appreciate."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not born voluntarily."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so used to say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they don't dare to talk openly about the experience, because shame is too big."</seg>
<seg id="36">"since they often don't know how to help, they need more accommodations just for them, demands Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the housing of refugees."</seg>
<seg id="38">"on the question of whether they knew about a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction, some answers with no."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, for example, there is no such thing in the housing of governments."</seg>
<seg id="40">"in Swabia alone, hatched women are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesman of the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Upper Bavaria, Lower and Middle Franconia there are floors or own houses only for single women and their children."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Lower Bavaria, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">The committee "Rights of Women and Gender Equality" in the European Parliament also calls for women to be separated from men.</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study published for the committee, it says:" "it is very important that men and women are hosted separately."</seg>
<seg id="45">"if privacy is missing or men and women are accommodated together, it can lead to - continuous - violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"above all, the washrooms should be easily accessible and accessible for women, is included in the study."</seg>
<seg id="47">"how much the women feel this need of protection can be read at the crowd, whom it gives to the house in Munich."</seg>
<seg id="48">"since we have talked about it, we have a long waiting list," "says Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="49">You could easily make a second home.</seg>

<seg id="2">Representatives of the assistance doctors have called up their union to approve new employment campaigns in their disputes with regard to a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called for its entire Council to approve more work campaigns from the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC said that ministers had agreed to deal with the concerns about the treaty.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in July, assistance specialists and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract signed with the BMA."</seg>
<seg id="6">It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in a letter to the members published on Twitter on Thursday evening, the chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government had" persistently quiet "problems, which led to the rejection of the treaty."</seg>
<seg id="8">"she said:" "in view of this, the JDC Board has agreed to completely reject the proposed new treaty and call for official re-negotiations for all your concerns."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in response to the silence of the government, the JDC Board today submitted a formal application to a special meeting of the BMA Council in order to approve a running program of escalating work campaigns that begins at the beginning of September."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the disputes caused assistance doctors to strike six times this year, the first total failures in the history of the NHS."</seg>
<seg id="11">The director of the BMA resident doctor Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed contract conditions recommended by the BMA.</seg>
<seg id="12">"he shared BMA members during the sessions which took place before the vote by 54,000 resident doctors and medical students, with that the contract should be beneficial and accepted."</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "Alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands, and to proclaim an official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions."</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterpart in the gold-plated hall of the St. Petersburg palace, I cannot forfeit the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was a handshake, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putin smiles smiles and he barely shone warmth, even for his restrained relations."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke repeatedly of his" dear friend "Putin - according to a report all five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would have behaved as if nothing bad happened."</seg>
<seg id="11">"to me, his enthusiasm seemed rather to suggest the opposite."</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin's radiating, sustainable coolness revealed that Russia's head of state had forgotten nothing."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the shooting of a Russian fighter jet on the Syrian border through Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to that time has been kindled.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin denounced and accused Ankara that Russia had fallen into the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">"going on was even bigger, as it was done by a supposed friend."</seg>
<seg id="17">To rebuild the veto becomes difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months, the state controlled media led a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">At one time it seemed as if the Turks would blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">"most serious were the accusations of senior officials that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in Syria areas, controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He has denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">"but in St.Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward."</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology from President Erdogan, which he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could reserve a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Ankara, the advantages of a cease-fire lie clearly on the hand."</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan primarily needs all the friends he can get after he has been relieved of his ministry last month at a failed coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken it.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular, the prohibition of charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year."</seg>
<seg id="31">The number declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, travel agents and charter companies will be facilitated when the flights are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week, the state television forecast cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are again allowed."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows:" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Ankara is angry with the West, as it responds to the attempted power takeover as a weak response."</seg>
<seg id="38">"to this end, the continued grudge on the slug of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is keen to benefit from the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in Ankara, the Russian head of state won a bonus in Ankara that after the attempted coup d" état he called for support for the elected state organs. "</seg>
<seg id="40">"for Moscow, this is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime change."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit in this glittering palace at the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to portray an" Alliance of outsiders "as an analyst once described: two countries, who violate the West and feel badly treated and are now fading."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite the public atonement, there are still great differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave up its role as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents met at the press conference saying that they had not even stripped the subject."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin chose to emphasize this."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and in the face of the potential for a complete disaster, when NATO member Turkey abuded the Russian combat jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state talk at least once more."</seg>

<seg id="5">"since then, the bank has distanced itself from being nearly collapsed and saved eight years ago."</seg>
<seg id="6">"during this time, brand strategists" RBS "have used to protect other end-consumer brands."</seg>

<seg id="9">"the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized."</seg>

<seg id="11">The brand Ulster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.</seg>

<seg id="13">McEwan was interviewed during a viewing tour of customers and employees in Inverness-Shire.</seg>
<seg id="14">He shared the BBC Scotland with: "the brand RSB will become our Investors brand and the brand under which our employees will be employed as we now become more of a bank of brands.</seg>

<seg id="16">"I say now that we do not pursue global goals, but local goals."</seg>
<seg id="17">Each of these brands will stand in their own congregations for something completely different and our employees will work with the customers among these brands.</seg>
<seg id="18">"RBS has already said that it will not continue its Six Nations sponsorship, and that it will increase the perceptibility of the different brands in its sports sponsorship."</seg>
<seg id="19">"it is time for us to develop into the bank of the brands, as how do we focus within (we have asked ourselves) to make this a better bank for customers?" said the Chairman of the Board. "</seg>
<seg id="20">It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these brands.</seg>

<seg id="6">"Anton Vaino, who has been a representative since 2012, was appointed to his successor."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat."</seg>
<seg id="8">"born in Tallinn in the Estonian capital in 1972, he graduated from the renowned State Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo."</seg>
<seg id="9">"on the Kremlin's website, it is called (in Russian) that he later was the chief of the clerks and staff of the government."</seg>
<seg id="10">He said to Putin about his appointment: "thank you for your confidence."</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it's the most important task of the government to support your work as head of state in respect of bills and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked to leave his post and recommend Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Do the smiling faces convince?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow more mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Sergey Ivanov had long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest confidants and works as he did for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB."</seg>
<seg id="16">"as Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country."</seg>
<seg id="17">"at a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff retire at his own request."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but despite the ridicule for the cameras, only a few of them are convinced - especially now, shortly before the parliamentary elections."</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the consequence of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at all.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official statement - that a man who once was once touted as a potential president should once again lead the Russian environmental policy - met with great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in his remarks to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said:" "it is true that I asked you at the beginning of 2012 in a conversation to give me this very complicated post - you could almost say - complaining for four years."</seg>
<seg id="23">"as it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months."</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and how Putin was a former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB) who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy."</seg>
<seg id="28">"when Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people whom he trusted the most."</seg>
<seg id="29">"it was once believed that after Putin's second term, Ivanov could become president of Russia since a third term of Putin had violated the constitution."</seg>
<seg id="30">"but this post was taken by another close allies' coup, Dmitry Medvedev."</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he became President three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the northern deck of the Queensferry crossings with the viaduct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is the first of four sealings of the" "Deck blowers", "approaching completion around each of the three towers of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 helical ropes."</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister Keith Brown made a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said: "this is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry crossings.</seg>
<seg id="10">"we are all witness to engineering from a truly epic scale in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="11">"despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a tricky activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in total, almost 79% of the total bridge deck is placed in its place and the last section of the deck today gets a concrete juggling for the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Michael Martin, Project Manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructor said:" the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"with this fantastic project, the fastener represents forward-looking construction and civil engineering."</seg>
<seg id="15">"after installing the last road cover section and its connection to the existing north turret deck, we had to close the existing gap on the north or the shore."</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern allocation bridge 700 millimeters to the south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">"massive since the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards on a slope of approx. 3%."</seg>
<seg id="19">"uncle, because the tolerances on which the team were working were tiny - on each side they entered only a few millimetres."</seg>

<seg id="1">Who builds cheap apartments in Braunschweig?</seg>
<seg id="2">"in the future, the SPD and Greens are saying: investors should be much more involved in the future."</seg>
<seg id="3">How do we react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 homes in the coming years?</seg>
<seg id="4">"at the next meeting, the SPD proposes a" "concept of action for housing". ""</seg>
<seg id="5">But dispute is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">"first of all, it's about the question: who should build the cheap apartments?"</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"said S & D Group president Christoph Bratman:" "we agree with the Greens: those who want to build on urban areas will have to show 20 percent of all apartments as social housing in the future."</seg>
<seg id="9">"however, the cheap apartments can also be produced in the inventory."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, the big dispute in the town hall is," said Bratman: "how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces?"</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas, but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="12">"a new urban housing development program, which will cost millions and still has to be financed, should provide incentives."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the problem, as Bratman said:" there is currently no agreement between the factions. "</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU would like to make investor as few regulations as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants even tougher conditions for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">"despite this, so viola, there is a tightening of the situation on the housing market."</seg>
<seg id="17">"if the concept of action is implemented, it will take care of additional tasks in the building management."</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is required.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but the programme is not yet complete: the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but how do you reconcile the loss of additional 1,300 cheap apartments, whose funding will expire in the next few years?"</seg>
<seg id="22">"by 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments."</seg>
<seg id="23">"to prevent this, such as the planned female spokeswoman Nicole Palm, should now be bought out bonds from the city."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in addition, it would have to be thought about bringing apartments back into price binding."</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the west city.</seg>
<seg id="26">At one stroke the problem could be solved.</seg>
<seg id="27">"for in the west city, at the end of the year, Frists are running."</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments you could get back to the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only: this does not want the owners, the housing corporations."</seg>
<seg id="30">"because the number of social housing in the West Bank is increased drastically, one is removed from the target of the so-called mix."</seg>
<seg id="31">There should be no more concentration of social weak in just a few parts of the city.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens expect there will still be movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"group leader Holger Herlitschke says:" "for a broad majority, the CDU must go into the boat."</seg>
<seg id="34">"on the other hand, I have concentrated on more building sites for single family homes."</seg>
<seg id="35">But what does not mean is that a compromise can not yet be found.</seg>

<seg id="1">"Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it"</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">"teenagers and children can no longer go outside, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time staring on screens, was complained by many in the last decade."</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">"the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then on video games and last on smartphones."</seg>
<seg id="6">"therefore, it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive."</seg>
<seg id="7">"of course, I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that is based on the characters that were initially created for the video games in the 1990s (later it created a animation series, playing cards and other spin-offs)."</seg>
<seg id="8">"like many pop culture phenomena, the interest in the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand fell slightly at the beginning of July."</seg>
<seg id="9">Market launch in other countries was postponed due to the massive demand that overloaded the servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">"within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">"in short, players go outside with their smartphones outside and search for Pokémon, which can be tracked with a GPS and, once they have been found," photographed "(via a screenshot on the phone) or" captured. ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"a generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the track and jumped for the search of the sofa."</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the USA, the game resulted in a considerable increase in steps that the" average "person puts back every day."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, followed by 35,000 users recently announced that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of tracked people who train every day 30 minutes jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent."</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data for the increase in performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"many public awareness campaigns on health which people want to take" "take 30 minutes" "to" "get out of the sofa" "and" "be active every day" "on deaf ears, because many public messages about health are boring and come from people who look miserable."</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overrated."</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who regularly exercise sports will reduce their chances of suffering from cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">"physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to lead them here."</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">"thus three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine and fun."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close friends on hunting.</seg>
<seg id="24">"as always, there are also frivolous gamblers who always have to complain about something."</seg>
<seg id="25">"and yes, someone could run against a door."</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it be?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough happened.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even if Smartphone-Apps like Fitbit could track our activity earlier, they did not give us any reason to do sports as it does this game."</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will fade with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">"but because of Pokemons's success there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the active ones in the real world and help many people hunt, more active, fitter and healthier."</seg>

<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast klomm became a multi-champion title on Thursday and enlarged the gap between herself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the headlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Her overall score of 62.198 was clearly before the silver medal winner and "Final Five" team cameradin Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">"the American female Simone Biles Turns on the Swedish beam during the single combat training of women in the gymnastics during the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Biles is the fourth heterosexual American woman who wins a multi-campaign title, and a total of the fifth while she consolidates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all."</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears as her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment came to an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">"this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes, such as Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:"</seg>
<seg id="16">"the last three years have dominated their sport, 15 world medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision, that the Olympic Champion of 1984 Mary Lou bailon told her that she is the best gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">"she expected her last examination in Brazil, a competition not so much going between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a burden of oversized expectations."</seg>
<seg id="18">"not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas would be considered disappointment."</seg>

<seg id="23">This is not a coincidence.</seg>

<seg id="25">"since the summer of 2013, she has not lost any more competition competition, a winning streak that will continue as long as Billy wishes."</seg>

<seg id="30">"the performance Raismans was revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a Tiebrake."</seg>
<seg id="31">"this time the 22-year-old team captain, called" Oma, "had a lead."</seg>
<seg id="32">"after her soil practising, she cast out kisses to the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback, which sometimes seemed doubtful."</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to police reports released on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot, who died in one of Phoenix's deadly attacks since a decade, while they stopped in the car and listened to music."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis's daughter Maleah were shot on June 12th, while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said."</seg>
<seg id="4">The perpetrator fired eight shots from a hand-fired firearm while standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle in the report.</seg>
<seg id="5">"the police said that the threefold murder did not seem to be the result of a robbery robbery, as the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900, which were owned by one of the adult victims."</seg>
<seg id="6">Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting was tempting the investigators to take a closer look at whether they were associated with four previous attacks.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in total, seven people were killed in hispanic residential neighborhoods within four months and two others were injured."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it happens in a residential area in front of a house," said Howard the KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, at the beginning of the month. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"it is assumed that the suspect has used several vehicles, including a brown Nissans from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln."</seg>
<seg id="10">Investigators refused to expose the evidence they led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same murderer.</seg>

<seg id="7">A flood warning system is used across wide parts in the south Louisiana until Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="8">The weather service announced that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area.</seg>
<seg id="9">"in the south of Alabama a flood warning system was deployed on Friday, while the area of Mobile continued to rain."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the river Comite near Baton Rouges and the river Amite near Denham Springs, both located in Louisiana, are likely to reach record levels over the weekend."</seg>
<seg id="11">The metereologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many houses near Baton Rouge.</seg>
<seg id="12">"he also said that a flood-downward flooding in Ascension Parish poses a danger, as the flooding flows only slowly flow into Lake Maureas."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the Tickfaw river, south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 09.00."</seg>
<seg id="14">Bailout teams still plucked people from the flood waters in the Amite and Wilkinson districts in the southwest of Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Leroy Hansford, his wife and his stepson were among those who were rescued by Gloster on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Hansford, 62, says that the water of Beaver Creek, which normally lies more than 400 feet from his house, has risen strongly over night."</seg>
<seg id="17">He said that another son-son who lives nearby would have warned him.</seg>
<seg id="18">"we woke up and the water flowed and came in," "said Hansford."</seg>
<seg id="19">It reached my waist.</seg>
<seg id="20">"his wife told Hansford that in the 48 years she lived there, she had never seen such a high level of the river."</seg>
<seg id="21">Hansford said he and his family members had all disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Hansford said that emergency helpers would have saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Gloster, where they stayed until Friday."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Krautmann said that the flooding" "spread quickly," "as there were still heavy rainfalls and that the authorities consider evacuation instructions."</seg>
<seg id="24">"according to Krautmann, an observer in the vicinity of Livingstone melted from midnight to Friday morning of 13.75 inches of rain."</seg>
<seg id="25">Krautmann said that the soil has been significantly outweighed by rainfall since Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="26">The authorities stated that heavy rainfalls and street flooding caused the rescuing of inhabitants from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and their crew in five school districts.</seg>
<seg id="27">The WWL subsidiary of the CBS reported that a co-ordinator in Tangipahua attacked 200 flooded houses.</seg>
<seg id="28">The inhabitants were evacuated in two churches that were both flooded now.</seg>
<seg id="29">"the leader of the municipality Robby Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets, washed by the floods."</seg>

<seg id="7">The condition of the boy was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations.</seg>
<seg id="8">The boy's family told the transmitter that he is likely to recover again.</seg>
<seg id="9">He should have started the first class in a local elementary school.</seg>

<seg id="1">"why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie"</seg>
<seg id="2">This is what I present under the Women's Olympics in Turning and that is more than a reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">"first of all, I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant."</seg>
<seg id="4">"and secondly: this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren" Laurie "Hernandez, inspiring for many young girls of other skin colour."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewess, and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, rounds off, makes everyone proud."</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in the last four years, the number one among female gymnasts was an Afro-American woman."</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">That shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">"at the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America."</seg>
<seg id="12">"now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected but masterful gyms routines."</seg>
<seg id="13">"on Thursday Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won gold in an individual multi-competition event for women."</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">"we experience the top of this sport, but they don't look like sports classes throughout the country."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Simone, Gabby and Laurie all beat the same way as Aly and Madison to put it into the Olympic team."</seg>
<seg id="17">"they are the" "Last Five", "because the next Olympic team will have only four female gymnasts in the team. besides, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as trainer."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but the reality is such that gymnastics are an expensive sport and Turner is primarily involved in private gymnastics that are maintained by parents who pay for training, furnishing, travel, clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnasts and families)."</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these Turnstones lie in affluent suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in these clubs, the gymnastics receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, both trained their athletes since they started the gymnastics."</seg>
<seg id="22">"we have to give the churches aun countless, young girls, who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, an affordable and easier accessible gym."</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gym of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">"at my events, we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youth (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners."</seg>
<seg id="25">"in September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth high-quality gymnastics that deserve the opportunity to learn and profit from this great Olympic sport."</seg>
<seg id="26">"gymnastics develop strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind."</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">"it is the inspiration of this team, which brings thousands of young girls to interest in the gymnastics and that's great."</seg>
<seg id="29">"it is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls."</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">"thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real presentation of" Girl Power "by holding the Olympic team gold and thank you for being motivated by so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way of becoming healthy, strong and successful young women."</seg>

<seg id="17">"employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important issues - such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those who return from a professional period, training kests, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training vacations and the gender-specific pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious it was the employers, the Health Education UK and the Ministry of Health in respect of the compliance with the BMA in November, February and May."</seg>

<seg id="1">Political Correctness Culture raises election fraud in Muslim areas</seg>
<seg id="2">Former Mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed last year on the omission of a government report for corruption from office</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of Political Correctness has led to the fact that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is knowingly ignored as a devastating government report today revealed.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Sir Eric Pickles, former cabinet member, verbally attacks the police, election observers and town halls to have ignored indications of election abuse on account of" crimes against ethnicity and religion. ""</seg>
<seg id="5">"the former Minister of Integration and Local Government, who is now an anti-corruption king, said that the intimidation of voters from religious reasons would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up shut-off tapes outside of elective cabins to protect intimidated voters."</seg>
<seg id="6">He recommends that voters should carry out a badge in order to prove their identity in elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">"at the moment, a voter must simply call his name and address."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the report proposes non-removable ink to apply to a person's finger, when they release their votes to prevent someone from choosing twice."</seg>
<seg id="9">"whistleblower should receive more protection, says Sir Eric."</seg>
<seg id="10">He demands that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions of non-official committees or working groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this serves not only against electoral fraud, but also to protect the municipal government from the broader corruption and financial crisis that goes along with it," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was ordered from Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlet's election scandal in eastern London.</seg>
<seg id="13">"last year, a Special Electoral Court decided that the acting mayor Lutfur Rahman should be relieved after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry."</seg>
<seg id="14">The Court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in cynical fashion" and that he would silence his critics with racism and Islamophobia.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "Rahman is said to have led" "his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to elect him." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the result of imitation where one person chooses someone else.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">He expressed particularly alarming about the fraudulent choice of letters - in which older members of the Muslim community had pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including the guiding of evidence to prove the identity"</seg>
<seg id="20">"in its report, it is said:" as evidence has been established that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exerted, in particular women and young people, in particular with the will of the elderly, in particular communities with Pakistani or criminal background. "</seg>
<seg id="21">There were concerns that... state institutions would have knowingly ignored such a behaviour due to "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Sir Eric said 50 recommendations to clean the system, including the prohibition that political activists handle letter selection papers to stop" reaping "electoral papers."</seg>
<seg id="23">"the report, which is considered by Theresa May, also requires tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral list being used for immigration and social security purposes."</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider asking voters before choosing your ID.</seg>
<seg id="25">Use non-removable ink on a person's finger as soon as she has released her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice.</seg>
<seg id="26">Conduct systematic reviews on the nationality of a person to ensure they are optional.</seg>
<seg id="27">A three-year limitation on applications for automatic selection of letters.</seg>
<seg id="28">Prohibition that political activists handle full post-elections and envelopes of local elections.</seg>
<seg id="29">The police have the power to shut off voting stations.</seg>
<seg id="30">A change of legislation that facilitates an accusation due to intimidation in accordance with the People Act 1983 (Legislative Act 1983).</seg>
<seg id="31">Photographing in polling stations.</seg>
<seg id="32">Requirement that only English may be used in the voting stations (except Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">Intensification of the training in order to ensure that the employees generally enforce that voters go into the election cabin alone.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that after the Tower Hamlet case there was no criminal complaint.</seg>
<seg id="35">"the electoral court has declared Luton Rahman and his deputy for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="36">"due to a number of reasons, he was found guilty on a number of reasons - according to the high requirements of the criminal proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="37">"he also criticises the effective" "checkpoints" "of the election registration departments of the town halls."</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Eric said: "the court ruling in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.</seg>
<seg id="39">"our country bears a proud legacy as the Mother of Parliaments, but the worrying and covert spread of election fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation."</seg>

<seg id="3">"to worsen the situation, she looked like she looked at it, pulled her out and put them back into the shelf again."</seg>
<seg id="4">She continued to browse and tried four pairs of underpants in a shop at the Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone.</seg>
<seg id="5">"the primary business in the Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone, where the woman tried the underpants before she put them back into the shelf"</seg>
<seg id="6">"a mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in store at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman had tried underwear she went back and left the shop without buying anything."</seg>
<seg id="7">"she said," "People could not believe what they saw."</seg>
<seg id="8">"standing in the middle of the sales floor she took a pair of underpants from the delivery, drew her own tights and pants and tried them."</seg>
<seg id="9">"she didn't even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, cheeky like Oskar."</seg>
<seg id="10">"everyone stared when she pulled out the underpants that you obviously didn't like, as she put them on the shelf again."</seg>
<seg id="11">She repeated the same thing with three other underpants before she finally decided that she didn't like anything and went out and went out.</seg>
<seg id="12">"she did not seem to disturb anyone, or to think about the person who would possibly buy the underpants she had tried."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Davidson, 33 who lives in Kent, said:" "how to think that someone would take home who had a different person and who were not washed."</seg>
<seg id="14">The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Davidson added:" "as I have seen, the employees tried to pull out the clothes from selling after they went - which is just as good."</seg>
<seg id="16">I would hate to go home with a new couple of underpants and find out that another woman had her and went out and did not wash them.</seg>
<seg id="17">"a spokesman for Primark said:" "Primark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday August 9 at our branch in Folkstone."</seg>
<seg id="18">All products coming into question were drawn out of sale.</seg>

<seg id="2">"the world outside is a dangerous place, but this video by Dailymail.com could make it a little more secure."</seg>
<seg id="3">"we spoke to Rhon Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close distance."</seg>
<seg id="4">"regardless of whether you approach you from the front or back, this video will show you how to turn the skewer to your predator."</seg>
<seg id="5">"if you approach you from behind, you should turn around as first, so that you can see your attacker and" go out of the line, "says Mizrachi."</seg>
<seg id="6">Then grab the weapon between your forearm and shoulder before hitting it with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">"beat him with his knee in the bar and twist the weapon out of his hands, the weapon out of his hands. hit him with the barrel and move backwards while holding the gun on him."</seg>
<seg id="8">"with attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body from the shot line, grab the gun and twist it so that the attacker can not shoot."</seg>
<seg id="9">"at the same time, store the weight on the weapon and beat the aggressor to the chest, then twist the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and the weapon on it."</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveller Ian Wright shabt his tongue for a guide to the dirtiest places in Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveller undertook his immune system and strangled a serious test by licking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk took his course on a euro note, a railing on Piccadilly Circus, a rinsing button of a pull-in toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"before removing any object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he is going to do."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, which was filmed under the title" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "brought some surprising results."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought of licking the flush button of a pull-in toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke to doctors and healthcare professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and their own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"fortunately, nothing left what he licked, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Mr. Wright was known to test the resilience of his bowels by travelling through the world, and eating strange as well as wonderful things."</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public funds to railway stations to sinks of toilets, the task presented his immune system definitely under a test"</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the film he said:" "as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the film, he was able to do justice to his reputation."</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he rejected was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His sample painting showed a luminometry of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"compared to this, the luminometry of freshly washed hands amounts to less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to lick off after their luminometry was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands were less than 60"</seg>
<seg id="17">"Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film he says:" "that comes close to the worst thing I've got in a toilet."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirty than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I won't find anything here because it is disgusting here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">"the company provides Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support intestinal bacteria and immune system."</seg>
<seg id="23">"valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, Shafts and New categories Niko Vuormaa says:" "we really wanted to offer the consumer something new."</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explain the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We performed crazy brainstorming that ended up saying "Let's call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking just about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added:" "let me say this - I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he had tasted some of the things I had told him to lick, just like the disgusting Russian toilet, which is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course, there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to lick her and others where this was quite difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad that we recorded some of these filthy goodies on film.</seg>
<seg id="33">"in a survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of all respondents reported lactic acid bacteria especially with the well-being of the stomach and the intestines and 58 percent said they use at least occasionally products containing included lactic acid bacteria."</seg>

<seg id="2">"an asocial family left their social apartment after a deletion with a loss of £50,000, because they had terrorized their neighbors."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall."</seg>
<seg id="4">"after they were forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing association found the property in an irreparable state."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the walls had clad holes, wood boards were torn up, rubbish was scattered on the floor and graffiti was smeared to the walls."</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been relocated and it is assumed that they are now living in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">"Donna McEvoy, who works for house administration at Cornwall Housing, said that she fears that the apartment is no longer repairing."</seg>
<seg id="8">She said: "it was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I think that people do not have to live in this way.</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider as this property is probably considered not as beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and their reputation is also.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inflicted was street fights with baseball bat, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking, and excessive screams, strides and floods."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Skelby, 47, whose name was on the lease, received an order for anti-social behaviour in June."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in some rooms of the house, which is torn down under certain circumstances, old trash was found"</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the estate where drugs were traded in the past, the wood boards were torn up"</seg>
<seg id="15">"neighbours said that they saw them fighting on the street, and regularly called the police to be invoked."</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing and her partner forcibly removed from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Delogians were cheered by facilitated neighbours who said that their lives were made to hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">"one said," They were not complaining about anyone. "</seg>
<seg id="19">We lived 20 years apart from them and it was always bad.</seg>
<seg id="20">The countless times we tell the police here are incredible.</seg>
<seg id="21">"this morning we could not sleep."</seg>
<seg id="22">We stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to that!</seg>
<seg id="23">"now that they are finally gone, it will be nice."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it would have administered the family to cooperate with the local authorities."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals, 20 years long."</seg>
<seg id="26">Rubbish and old toys were thrown down on the crowded side of the community house</seg>
<seg id="27">"he added:" "it is a shame that the tenant admits to accept any responsibility for their behavior and their family since a deletion is always the last step, considering Cornwall Housing."</seg>
<seg id="28">"this was a very difficult case, because the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be terrible."</seg>
<seg id="29">"I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and have given us the information provided."</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will donate consolation to some neighbours and the message conveyed that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20."</seg>
<seg id="32">"a dirty mattress, which is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house following the deletion on the floor."</seg>
<seg id="33">Workers of the house administration will now have to clean garbage mountains that surround the house</seg>
<seg id="34">"in 2014, the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70g of cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and cash in the amount of £1,700."</seg>
<seg id="35">"Skelby was awarded a fine, after having found herself guilty of the possession of a class B drug in commercial custody."</seg>
<seg id="36">She claimed that the money for a tombstone of her son Lee Skeldon was born in 2013 in a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="37">"after being homeless, Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth."</seg>
<seg id="38">Many walls of the house were covered with graffiti.</seg>
<seg id="39">Police say they will delegate renters who do not stick to the house rules</seg>
<seg id="40">Angela Crow of the Police of Devon and Cornwall told that the Delogians were a clear warning to the other tenants who did not stick to the house rules.</seg>
<seg id="41">"this goes to those who think that they can act without blame, as well as those who have been harmed by such behaviour," "she said."</seg>
<seg id="42">The police of Devon and Cornwall will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.</seg>

<seg id="4">"it was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air raid in Raqqa, the bulwark of the group in the country, ITV News reported on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="5">Sultana was 17 years old and died shortly after she had predestined to leave the land-torn country and return to England.</seg>
<seg id="6">"one can only hope that the only good lies - as reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to stop people from ever making this decision," said Akunjee. "</seg>
<seg id="7">"in February 2015, Sultana and two other school girls from the east of London entered an airplane in the direction of Turkey and subsequently entered a bus to the Syrian border."</seg>

<seg id="2">"anyone who doesn't fit and praises Erdogan is sitting on packed suitcases," "says the chairman of the Gülen-close Foundation Dialogue and World, Ercan Karakoyun."</seg>
<seg id="3">"in the short term, the Kurdish community of Germany expects to flee from Turkey to Germany with tens of thousands of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in the medium term it might even be" "a hundred thousand", "believes the President of the Association Ali Toprak."</seg>
<seg id="5">"due to the harsh precepts of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany."</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the short term, I reckon with tens of thousands, in the medium term, with a few hundred thousand protection-seekers from Turkey in Germany, if the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition," "says the President Ali Toprak of the" "World" "from Friday."</seg>
<seg id="7">"because the government had already covered Kurdish strongholds with criminal charges a few months ago, 500,000 Kurds were fleeing within Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="8">"after the depleted coup, secular and oppositional ethnic Turks were added."</seg>
<seg id="9">Many will want to restart in Europe if they are further suppressed in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="10">"it cannot be that a state that takes up refugees themselves, produces refugees in their own country," said Toprak. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"the Chief of the Association lamented the specific settling of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in Algerian towns."</seg>
<seg id="12">"thus, Erdogan wants to increase the entry pressure to the remaining Kurds."</seg>
<seg id="13">"they are the last big minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already exterminated or expelled in the past hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a CDU member. "</seg>
<seg id="14">The Chief Prosecutor called for the German government to sit "as sharp as Austria against Erdogan and his supporters."</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals don't get anything from the summer campaign with - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to vote the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in 2021, the state election will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year."</seg>
<seg id="5">"for it's not stupid than until now: summer holidays, heat and land elections - that bites."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the locals, who are to be convinced by the campaigners, are on vacation."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most of the vacationers who are in the country, on Usedom, Ruegen or Hiddensee are no natives, so are not allowed to choose the Landtag."</seg>
<seg id="8">"there are practical problems: during the holidays, helpers who hang up posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers, and count out voices in the end, only painstakingly pick up."</seg>
<seg id="9">"until September 4, 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to pass the election campaign just short of the people."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun."</seg>
<seg id="11">"and it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, needs to fear his office."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys."</seg>
<seg id="13">"exciting is how strongly newcomer AfD cuts off, and what remains at the end of coalitionspace remains."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost inconspicuous election campaign, one sees from his big posters."</seg>
<seg id="15">"he travels through the country, distributes roses and chats a little with the people, just as it did his legendary eloquent predecessor, Harald Ringstorff."</seg>
<seg id="16">"otherwise, Soul-ering has got cold feet and gives chancellor Merkel the guilt at the flowering of AfD."</seg>
<seg id="17">"their refugee policy, their" "We create the" "hastens the rise of the right-wing populists, which is now likely to cost him the beautiful office."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the CDU with its top candidate, the Minister of the Interior, Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is if you are at the right place in the right place at the wrong time."</seg>
<seg id="19">She has invited German chancellor Angela Merkel to large-scale rallies; Merkel's Bundestag group is in the Northeast.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern."</seg>
<seg id="21">"there was probably the majority of other federal states," complained Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, recently in the NDR. "</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's not a shame to anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once.</seg>
<seg id="23">"otherwise, the Nordost-CDU waives the usual campaign conditions at market places and in front of shopping malls with umbrellas and balloons."</seg>
<seg id="24">"this, according to Kokert, plays only a" subordinate role. ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Union has also noted that, in the country, you have to cut off the base that it has to be very tough to find a wire to the people."</seg>
<seg id="26">"you are doing it like the left, the SPD, the Greens: in the pages of the country hardly any."</seg>
<seg id="27">"the Council of the CDU election champion Kokert on his comrades is also self-exposing:" "they must go where it hurts, namely where people are: Dorffeste, golden weddings, every birthday party must be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">"because there is a lot on the game, Sellering has called his SPD to a particularly committed election campaign."</seg>
<seg id="29">"in surveys, the Socialists and Democrats lagged on 22 percent behind the CDU (25) and just under the AfD (19)."</seg>
<seg id="30">"at the 2011 election, the SPD had yet clearly gained 35.6 percent before the CDU (22)."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the Greens, a small party with seven percent in the surveys, are likely to make the leap into the Landtag."</seg>
<seg id="32">"they make a modern virtue out of their holidays, and largely relocate their election campaign to the internet."</seg>
<seg id="33">"the president, Claudia Müller, is calling for an online election campaign."</seg>
<seg id="34">"otherwise, green campaigners embark on a search for local vocal folds among the vacationers."</seg>
<seg id="35">"Silke Gajek, the top candidate, just curvt with a houseboat through the Mecklenburg lakes and finds it also beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="36">Their impression: "election holidays in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment."</seg>

<seg id="2">"the speed, with which the B 27 is rehabilitated, is nothing to complain about."</seg>
<seg id="3">"for those responsible for the construction work, which begin at 5.30am and end only at 8 o'clock in the morning, there are all praise."</seg>
<seg id="4">"they have done everything quite jagged," Elvira Tetzlaff talks about the jet fuel station. "</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a super team.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is also no delay.</seg>
<seg id="7">"at the beginning of the week, the construction site could be moved to the south as planned, until the end of October everything should be ready."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the opposite of those responsible for the construction work will also be commended, for example when it comes to furnishing accommodation."</seg>
<seg id="9">"since the construction site has been immigrated to the south on Monday and the blocking of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen has been lifted and thus the connection to Rottenburg is back, the traffic situation within the resort has eased."</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now return from Ofterdingen from the B 27 on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">Evasive traffic through the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there were some considerable complaints," says the deputy chief conductor Florian King responsible for the technical management of the refurbishment. "</seg>
<seg id="13">"the inhabitants of Bachelstrasse, Steinlachstraße, Hafner Street and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise, because many sneakers sought and rather trusted their Navi as the signage."</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that some trucks were fraying in residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">"since the speed limits were not met, the municipality amplified the vehicle from Mössingen."</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were considerable transgressions," says King, who made himself informed on the spot himself. "</seg>
<seg id="17">Two to three per minute have been fired.</seg>
<seg id="18">The fastest was on the road with 77 hourly miles in the Tempo zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">"since the construction site has been moved, however, it has become quieter."</seg>
<seg id="20">For the businessmen at the B 27 it is only a small consolation that for customers from Rottenburg the street is now open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the maps.</seg>
<seg id="22">"but that the B 27 refurbishment has led to sales drops in them, anyone you ask will be able to look through."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, some are more and some less affected."</seg>
<seg id="24">"for those who have less to do with the" "end customer", "so for other companies, the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences."</seg>
<seg id="25">"in the Autohaus Maier, too, Thomas Sulz speaks of a" maximum moderate decline, "but also admits that of course" the running search is missing. "</seg>
<seg id="26">The most heavily exploited are the spots along the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">"J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly Crown, finds clear words."</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already existential.</seg>
<seg id="29">"not only him, but all the restaurants have" "hit hard". ""</seg>
<seg id="30">"the customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing."</seg>
<seg id="31">We need to be happy about every euro turnover.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in terms of sales revenue, it affects" far beyond 50 percent. ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The street renovation took its operation "for two years."</seg>
<seg id="34">He had to leave half of his staff.</seg>
<seg id="35">"if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed, politics would have reacted differently."</seg>
<seg id="36">"instead, President Jörg Schmidt replied to a request by Göhner if there could be a financial compensation, with the hint that the inn would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the location on the B. now it must also bear the disadvantages due to the refurbishment."</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties where something more generous has been handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">"with all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="39">"after all, the family business has been located here since 1715 and refers to the long history."</seg>
<seg id="40">"that other regular guests are now less frequent due to the complicated traffic guidance, he can understand."</seg>
<seg id="41">"if you cannot drive, it is also very different."</seg>
<seg id="42">"after the renovation work has come back, Göhner has no doubts."</seg>
<seg id="43">"despite the crises associated with BSE and avian influenza, Göhner holds the impact of B 27 works on his customers for the biggest crisis that has experienced his hometown in its long-standing history."</seg>

<seg id="2">"following the latest proposals, Interior Minister de Maizière now presents a thick security package."</seg>

<seg id="4">And what does the coalition partner say to all this?</seg>
<seg id="5">Thomas de Maizière gives the sergeant.</seg>
<seg id="6">"all his proposals should be" politically reasonable "to the coalition partner," says the Federal Minister of Interior in the presentation of his new security package. "</seg>
<seg id="7">They demand no one.</seg>
<seg id="8">"other, further points would first be discussed within the parties."</seg>
<seg id="9">I also took part in that.</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, as the Minister of the Interior, he was on the basis of results and in a" "achievable consensus" "within the Coalition."</seg>
<seg id="11">"after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, de Maizière has taken a little time before presenting its conclusions for security in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="12">"however, these are all the more extensive."</seg>
<seg id="13">"a lot is already known, announced, announced: that a new security authority should care for the cracking of encrypted communication is not new."</seg>
<seg id="14">"also, it is not the fact that Germany needs to implement multiple EU directives on passenger data and weapons."</seg>
<seg id="15">The call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is not surprising as well.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in part, de Maizière starts a second attempt for proposals that have not been done with the SPD: he wants sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and push jihadists with dual citizenship to the German passport."</seg>
<seg id="17">"this will be difficult points for the SPD," says the CDU. "</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, he thinks this is reasonable and does not demand anything in the coalition partner anyway."</seg>
<seg id="19">A few new ideas are presented de Maizière.</seg>
<seg id="20">They have partly in themselves: he plans quick procedures for deportations and more possibilities for detainting people from deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees who are targeted to the country should check their smartphones and reveal social media accounts for a security check.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the case of Dulces for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some worse places than previously - such as committing criminal offences or deliberately throwing their papers away in order to disguise their identity."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of them are politically and legally sanctioned.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some also works unexpectedly and leaves questions open.</seg>
<seg id="25">"and at some points - in the unequal treatment of tolerated ones, the question arises: what has it to do with security and terror?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between refugees and terror."</seg>
<seg id="27">But it is not possible to say that the attacks of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">"in addition, many people were worried about security in the face of the high levels of refugees."</seg>
<seg id="29">And things that people deeply concerned could not be clung out in election times either.</seg>
<seg id="30">The inner security is enormously concentrated in the focus.</seg>
<seg id="31">"first stops in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice."</seg>
<seg id="32">Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">The uncertainty is great.</seg>
<seg id="34">"yes, there are electoral struggles."</seg>
<seg id="35">"therefore, the Union and the SPD are increasingly in position on the subject of internal security."</seg>
<seg id="36">"in the past few days, between the two parties, it was high."</seg>
<seg id="37">"only a garrisome dispute over the Federal Police's equipment, then a security policy collection of some Unions Home Affairs Ministers, in which the resort managers also demand a ban on burka and a return from double citizenship."</seg>
<seg id="38">De Maizière also struggles for conciliatory sounds.</seg>
<seg id="39">"from a departure from the double pass, he keeps nothing."</seg>
<seg id="40">We have concluded the discussion in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="41">To reopen it does not make sense.</seg>
<seg id="42">"and with a ban on the Burka, he has constitutional objections."</seg>
<seg id="43">"whether his own package is constitutionally unconstitutional and if it is" reasonable "for the coalition partner, it must still be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="44">There is a lot in it that could cause strife.</seg>
<seg id="45">But the SPD is also trying to make a profit on the subject of internal security.</seg>

<seg id="9">"in Western Europe alone, after China the second most important market, sales were 14 percent below the previous year's level."</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the home market of Germany, deliveries dropped by almost one sixth."</seg>

<seg id="18">"Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles this time, 5,904 million worldwide."</seg>

<seg id="24">The reason is legal subtleties.</seg>
<seg id="25">The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen now offers its German customers a guarantee of environmentally friendly diesel models.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would have confirmed the last Monday VW-representative in the Federal Office of Transport.</seg>

<seg id="30">"VW has taken over the warranty that fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance will not take place after the conversion and all type approvals relevant vehicle values have remained unchanged."</seg>
<seg id="31">"Volkswagen itself uses the term" "warranty" "but not as it was stated in corporate travel."</seg>
<seg id="32">"with the wide term" "warranty", "Volkswagen sees the possibility that for example, half a year after the conversion, customers can come to a workshop for half a year after the conversion - and this could lead to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it."</seg>
<seg id="33">"also in the interest of the customer, it is important to avoid that there is no uncertainty about possible warranty rules in case of any other damage that has nothing to do with the scandal."</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination records: who actually buys records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle-aged love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">"before you hasten to comment, under the pseudonym non-alluring men's middle age with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the reemergence of vinyl records is not based on a boom in Millennials who want to welcome the news of physical objects, but due to Midlife-nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all foresight after the age of 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most improbable group of buyers."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hordes by hobbies - it has an emotional impact: older record buyers prefer their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results of YouGov agree?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog was a news report on television, the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, a modest gray suit and stub before I stand, hold my hands and say something more intimate, like:" so, let's take a closer look at it. "</seg>
<seg id="10">"so, let's take a look at it."</seg>
<seg id="11">"even though Soho's heart is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialty shops."</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch the camera for the next part in which I am in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to assess their age and mind by observing them.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, dem I of Sister Ray (Number of Number: two young women, three middle-aged men) into Reckless Records (Number of records: eight middle-aged men, a woman, probably around the 20), is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the stores to fill a few hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">"is he a collector, I ask?"</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess already," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 sheets."</seg>
<seg id="17">"these records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him home), dress the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records he couldn't afford than to buy and buy items he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late sixties, early 70's, who appeared when I was 11 or 12."</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and gladly spend time alone, and adds:" I don't smoke and I don't drink too much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">"WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers, whom he meets, applies to YouGov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pump, people who have heard about comeback and get to buy their old records again."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from the conversations I have led, people have usually been rid of their collection so around 1998 or 1999."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of trailers of a specific age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional importance of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a shop like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a calming community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to Wez, some of the older customers took impetus to the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to pull back to the stability of familiar sound discs, of objects that wake up happy youth memories."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or property of material possessions as a kind of consolation," "says Wez."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is a collector like me and I think it's like that with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "we are like their social workers!" "an employee flows out of a stack."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a survey by the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month, have not yet heard."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey also found out that 41% have a record player whom they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not own record players."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at this time of the news report, I would probably look very worried as I flatten through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Number of data: three middle-aged men) has noticed a" trophy aspect "of the revival."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came here only recently and said," "I don't own record players, but I would like to buy a Radiohead sound plate so that I can put them on the shelf," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens."</seg>
<seg id="41">"more productive, less musical."</seg>
<seg id="42">"we have people who say," I don't have a record player. "</seg>
<seg id="43">"they are younger people, not older ones who are only slowly coming in."</seg>
<seg id="44">"Fopp, dedicated to the sound panels almost a whole floor, has a colorful audience when I go in."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenage and middle-aged women."</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts newest synthesizer and sexbepacked pop instead of experimental jazz moans from the loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them looks strange, but next psychic traumas are hard to find if you stand beside someone for 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, has been running around the store for a few minutes and considers the variety of plates available for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">She is more likely to make a window mannequin than a large shopping.</seg>
<seg id="50">"it does not deserve much, therefore collecting plates is not a real option, she says."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it is easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of plates is..." it drives off with a dearest sigh. "</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a store that is said to have inspired a new generation of record enthusiasts: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I seem to watch the jeans pants, I watch a group of young teen girls who are grouping around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter are considering buying a Crosley record player."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left is a staircase, a wall full of records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"no one looks at them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them."</seg>
<seg id="58">"it is pure" "record-art". ""</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that every attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain."</seg>
<seg id="60">"it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items like plates."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even if my research shows that the results of YouGov are right, they are unconsidered, at least in record shops in Soho, the large number of female collectors who exist in reality, record stores and online forums."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they don't spend their Thursday tomorrow with the strolling through record shops of Berwick Street and the leaves through plates, while they steer clear of an uncanny, 30-year-old fake presenter who rises over the shoulders of nothing unsuspecting middle-aged men."</seg>

<seg id="2">"a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Calais jungle where thousands of refugees live."</seg>
<seg id="3">"during a trial this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary businesses where individuals within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, sell hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="4">Calais prefecture argues that these places should be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and that would be a risk of fire and stability.</seg>
<seg id="5">"humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups, would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="6">They also stated that the provisional businesses and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">"a court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who run the 72 temporary businesses, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were completely understandable."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than just feed people living in extremely precarious conditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas offer peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">"one of the places that was threatened by the decline was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is commonly operated and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="11">"more than 170,000 people have signed the petition to save the kids' café."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in a letter to the Guardian, it was said that" "the closure" "for these children would be a catastrophe, of which the youngest eight years are old."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the two relief organisations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp rose to more than 9,000 people - the highest number until now - following a steep increase in newcomers over the course of the summer."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Britain's impressive performance at 7-er Rugby came to an abrupt halt in the final hurdle in the final hurdle in the form of Fijis, when they were defeated here in Rio with a result of 43-7 at the Dean Stadium."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Fiji gave a master class in handling, side-steping, back-back, line-up and raw power to win gold - her first Olympiad of any color."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the defeat was missed by the not too bad silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they hit New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semifinals on the same day could fall back on them in the final."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but regardless of this, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in this form."</seg>
<seg id="7">"it could be a consolation for GB - but it probably won't be - that at least one Brit tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck: Fijis chief trainer Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon."</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind it.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago she lost any game at the Adelaide Sevilla under Ryan.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they just lost one.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this slag will hurt, but progress is amazing."</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started wonderful and kicked off the attacks from GBs.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. an, as if one would run into running buses. the World Series winners went up 5-0, as Osea Kolinisau rushed in the corner."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with four minutes of playing time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right-hand corner."</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB has hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">"a hilarious Tackle from Mitchell stopped the Berg of man Leone Nakarawa to score a third goal, but Fiji only stopped."</seg>
<seg id="17">"in the seventh minute, jasa versenalua stood in the right corner a touch down and there was 0-17 for GB."</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new album since the restarts and there was still over a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou pressed by further weak Tacklings of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">"it is as if Fiji had been born to play the 7, while the UK was still gutted."</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">"GB carried out basic changes at half-time and closed the fijian gap... for all four minutes, what was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua Tuisova went through a brilliant interplay of Fiji."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Dan Norton launched an attempt for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went long in favor of the South-seater, whose fans cheered, flags and danced on the tribune."</seg>

<seg id="3">"from the first stroke to the last 220 hard Hieve who enter history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa."</seg>
<seg id="4">"even if there were only the two who were sitting at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was there when she rowed at the second Olympic stadium in the second without a tax wife, the first women in the history of British sports who laid on such a scale."</seg>
<seg id="5">"her dominance was absolute, after all her 39th unintended use, which is also unparalleled."</seg>
<seg id="6">"what we see are two brilliant athletes, who glide over the surface with the elegance of swans, which is not reflected in the type of triumph."</seg>
<seg id="7">"behind every gold in the herd, there is a battalion of willing helpers who make a difference to incremental advances that make the difference and no one was more advanced than the coach who didn't know whether he would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer."</seg>
<seg id="8">"as he said, he risky."</seg>
<seg id="9">"I had bladder cancer, which is operable and that they did."</seg>
<seg id="10">"if you don't do that, it spreads everywhere."</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty awful situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little bit the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if that was the correct term at all."</seg>
<seg id="15">"I needed money, so I had to go better soon."</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">"I was in the hospital and walked around on the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be sufficient."</seg>
<seg id="18">That's how it starts.</seg>
<seg id="19">"the rowing on itself is already a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the immediacy of the victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerve wrecking morning with it more than usual, trying to process his own fears."</seg>
<seg id="21">"panning, who was a Captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment in Afghanistan, said," "I was an emotional wreck this week."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it repeats only how much it means to me, how much I and Helen and Robin worked."</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">"without Robin we would be no one, so a massive thank you to him. he is the best trainer in the world."</seg>
<seg id="25">I couldn't have wished for a better person to exercise or a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning won no race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to catch up, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve."</seg>
<seg id="29">We were caught very much at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Helen called" "remain in the process, stay in the process." ""</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important not to let yourself be carried away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we weren't looking forward to doing something great.</seg>
<seg id="33">"we didn't want fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race what we did."</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about their future.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Glover has to appear next week on a wedding, her own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall."</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that it was my last race.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have meant too much pressure.</seg>

<seg id="2">The crisis-torn and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared from additional costs in the amount of millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens that the industry threatened with green energy promotion are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it remains with the release of the Renewable Energy Sources at the existing plants for so-called self-power production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the" Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung "(WAZ, Friday edition)."</seg>
<seg id="5">I am really happy that after two years we could finally achieve tough negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="6">"according to this, the European Commission had initially planned to ask the steel producers to use the gases coming from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption."</seg>
<seg id="7">"according to the German industry association, the steel industry had an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year."</seg>
<seg id="8">Gabriel said the WAZ. now there is a fundamental agreement with the European Commission for talks with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">"only when the generators are replaced in the steel works, an EEG levelling of 20 percent is required."</seg>
<seg id="10">But also this will not be raised in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the European Commission on self-electricity production.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in this way, the status quo of the current regulation is extensively ascertained."</seg>
<seg id="13">The successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry have a special significance.</seg>
<seg id="14">"with regard to our campaign 'Steel is future', this is a first step."</seg>
<seg id="15">"others have to follow."</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "climate and employment targets are also to be pondered in the reform of emissions legislation," "said IG Metall leader Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt."</seg>
<seg id="17">"since the financial crisis in 2008, the steel industry in Europe suffers from overcapacity and significant price pressure."</seg>
<seg id="18">"last year, the situation worsened further, when the world's largest producer of products rose to the world market in view of the weakening domestic demand."</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel concessioning pricing dumping.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the course of this spring, the situation has somewhat relaxed."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on the one hand, imports of import duties on import steel show effect; on the other hand, economic prospects in China have risen."</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how sustainably the price collection is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry leader Thyssenkrupp was cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">"last but not least, the prices would have stagnated."</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">"in this context, ThyssenKrupp didn't want to exclude the closure of individual works."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the German steel industry, around 86000 people were employed at the end of 2015."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in July, despite rising prices and increasing orders, the German steel manufacturers remain cautious."</seg>
<seg id="29">"with 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year, such as the Steel Community on Friday."</seg>

<seg id="1">"community, spirit, health: singing does seniors good"</seg>
<seg id="2">"singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp for her whole life: as a young girl she was part of the school choir, she took music in the school choir and today the 78-year-old sings in an elderly choir."</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes. "</seg>
<seg id="4">"after a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and living in total, she says."</seg>
<seg id="5">"by the way, she does something good for her health and mind."</seg>
<seg id="6">"singing is a great hobby for senior citizens from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler from the German seniors division."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like-minded people, describes Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="8">"through regular meetings, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts."</seg>
<seg id="9">"because often social and family structures dissolve in age, a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "to speak and organize, to be able to leave and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together."</seg>
<seg id="11">"singing can be strenuous in the positive sense, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="12">For this exercise seniors a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who demand his lungs regularly will not be so quickly out of the puste in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">"even if it's about getting the sound of the voice at age, singing is an optimal hobby."</seg>
<seg id="15">"for elderly people, Singen often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Labour Association of Senior Citizens."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the older generations the common singing had a much higher value, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure time, she explains."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people awakes many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their adolescence."</seg>
<seg id="18">"through lyrics and especially melodies, people with dementia often fall back on long-back events."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in singing, the head also demands special performance, explains Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="20">To concentrate on one's voice and to a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">"elderly people, who live alone, practice not only to concentrate on themselves."</seg>
<seg id="22">"another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through singing in the choir, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great compliment.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem increases by singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">"to show oneself: if I practise for something long, I will get better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens."</seg>
<seg id="26">"good reasons to start singing, so there is enough."</seg>
<seg id="27">"if you want to try out a new hobby, don't hesitate - even if he thinks to have little talent, Lenz tells."</seg>
<seg id="28">"you don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears you already, when a note goes next to it?"</seg>
<seg id="29">"looking for the right offer, Seniors have different options, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="30">"someone from the circle of acquaintances sings in a senior choir, you can simply join."</seg>
<seg id="31">Many towns also offer overviews of the choirs in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Whoever wants to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">"if you don't have access to the Internet, the family, friends or neighbours may ask for help from internet research."</seg>
<seg id="35">"who wants to sing, should necessarily join a choir, advises Hackler."</seg>

<seg id="15">"from a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it was said."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the bomb attacks carry the same manuscript," said army general Danai Kritamavee Friday early to journalists. "</seg>
<seg id="17">We assume that this is a coordinated attack.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it is too early to express themselves to possible motives, but most likely it is about the deeds of Muslim rebels."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Thai media also wanted to recognise a pattern in the attacks, which is typical for the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country."</seg>
<seg id="20">"the Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks would not be linked to the Islamist revolt movement or international terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is only local sabotage which restricted itself to limited areas and provinces," "said a spokesman in Bangkok."</seg>
<seg id="22">"rather, one assumes that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military junta have been laid."</seg>
<seg id="23">"the authorities have received secrecy advice on upcoming attacks in the south of the country over the past few days, although they have not been informed of the exact time and places."</seg>

<seg id="31">Increased security risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday were followed a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution executed by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This gives the military great influence over the years to come.</seg>
<seg id="34">"Junta boss and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the bombs had been an attempt to stalk chaos, while the country moves towards stability, an improvement in economic conditions and tourism."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the military unta, who had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, reaffirmed itself to have the kingdom restored to stability and order."</seg>

<seg id="11">"in general, extremists try to address them with a youthful language, often with poppy music."</seg>
<seg id="12">The same Islamists as well as right-wing extremists.</seg>
<seg id="13">This is not an embarrassing advertisement for one's own thing.</seg>
<seg id="14">Propaganda is meant to appeal to people emotionally.</seg>
<seg id="15">Young people are particularly vulnerable.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="17">"last but not least, there have been reports from several federal states about contacts of the" Identities "to AfD politicians."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Maate said, he did not know how to do that."</seg>
<seg id="19">"for the constitutional protection, possible contacts of this type are only relevant at some point."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it depends on whether or not the respective party - in this case, the AfD - by certain individuals who are extremist, will change their direction and become extremist."</seg>
<seg id="21">The decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is not recognizable.</seg>
<seg id="23">"with a view to the marked increase in legal crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shelters, Maate said he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context."</seg>
<seg id="24">But we have seen in recent years that there can be right-wing terrorism structures.</seg>
<seg id="25">There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freital Group.</seg>
<seg id="26">"it may well be that other right-wing groups or groups of small groups are planning to plan attacks against asylum seekers, against refugee homes or attacks from other extremist motives."</seg>
<seg id="27">"however, a Germany-wide or Europe-wide control of right-wing terrorism cannot be discerned."</seg>
<seg id="28">The previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="29">Maate expressed concern about the fact that many attacks went to the account of people who had not appeared in the right scene before.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is worrying.</seg>
<seg id="31">"many of the suspects on asylum lodgings were previously not known as criminals, politically motivated offenders or supporters of the right scene."</seg>
<seg id="32">"so many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right-wing extremists, who might have been politically indifferent, or have chosen CDU, SPD or leftists, who, however, have radicalised themselves by right-wing extremist moods."</seg>

<seg id="6">"in social networks, Habit became a viral internethite."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in fact, the 24-year-old finished his lead with a setback of 48 seconds and occupied the 59th place of 59 starters."</seg>
<seg id="8">But it was rather his not just sporting figure that attracted the attention of the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why the 24-year-old still participates in the Olympics?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian got a special start right from the international swimming association.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to make swimming more famous in underrepresented countries.</seg>
<seg id="12">"as in Ethiopia, most athletes run, Habte simply wanted to do something different."</seg>
<seg id="13">Preparation is all: ROBEL Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.</seg>
<seg id="14">The first nicknames soon made the round.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some media referred to him as "Robel of the Wal."</seg>
<seg id="16">"based on a" "well-being", "the English boulevard" "The Sun" "was funny about him with" "Dad Bod". ""</seg>
<seg id="17">"his time, he only hit a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter freestyle, played no role."</seg>
<seg id="18">Comparisons with Eric the Eel were also drawn.</seg>
<seg id="19">Eric Moussambani took care of media attention at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney.</seg>
<seg id="20">"unforgettable was the appearance of the floats from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to compete alone in a suburb of 100 metres of freestyle."</seg>
<seg id="21">"frenetically, Moussambani was fired at that time."</seg>

<seg id="2">"at the facility in Azendorf, the waste water charge will be increased at the latest, if appropriate improvement measures are necessary."</seg>
<seg id="3">"after a high-level calculation, the sewage treatment in Azendorf will then be at 4.37 euros per cubic meter."</seg>

<seg id="9">"over the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- and / or covers from the previous calculation period can also be compensated."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Schmidt founded the serious agitator increases with the fact that there were relatively small facilities in all three sewage systems with a very small waste water incident, which was between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year."</seg>
<seg id="11">"as a result of the low distribution base, for example, expenses for necessary repairs would have a serious impact on the necessary repairs of several thousand euros."</seg>

<seg id="13">"furthermore, in the recumbent calculation period of all three plants, renovation and repair expenses were not least noticed in a considerable scope due to their age."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the plant in Azendorf is nearly 30 years old, the plants for outer dining, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp nearly 20 years old."</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt indicated that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced in the Azendorf wastewater facility due to damage.</seg>

<seg id="2">"Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say that it is insensitive to races."</seg>
<seg id="3">"with its filter tool, it enables Snapchat about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that borders on the absurdity."</seg>
<seg id="4">"you can transform yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Lichtenstein painting."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the filters are unblooded, self-rotating tools that produce more than 30 million self-produced selfies per day."</seg>
<seg id="6">All missteps get to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in the past, snapshooters have criticised themselves in the past where they were accused of using the app to promote black face or white skin as a beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when this week some users suggested a filter that gave them slit eyes, fake teeth and inflated cheeks, some critics called it racist caricature of Asians -" yellow face. ""</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a greater problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">"the news and outrage were widely spread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat shared that it would have disabled this feature."</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was meant as an homage to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but outsiders who have experienced racism, reminded the filter of hurting clichés."</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the anime comparison decided.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in an e-mail Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student, whose tweet was widely used across the photographs, was that the filter was" hurtful and salting. ""</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it was difficult to argue with the contrast of a very reluctant Asian caricature and the filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">"it shows that the filter is not safe, but that the yellow face was drawn into the degrading extreme."</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stumbling block.</seg>
<seg id="18">"American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand."</seg>
<seg id="19">And snapshots large audience of young people - who are more different in terms of race than their older opponents - could be more likely to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">"if one of Snapchats Filters creates a picture that is offensive for a user," it is much more difficult that such things stay unnoticed than it was earlier, "said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on Thursday, Zhu, who works as Product Manager and Engineer for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and asked others to do the same."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview, she said that she believes that rapid-related controversy mirrors a lack of diversity in the recruitment practices in Snapchat."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Zhu criticized the largely white, only male leaders and ended their essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat."</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce so they can make such decisions," "said the Chinese-American Zhu," "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">"others share their opinion, a complaint that has largely left Snapchat unanswered."</seg>
<seg id="26">The company publishes no numbers on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.</seg>
<seg id="27">"on Thursday, the company leaned Snapchat to discuss the cultural background of its employees, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a personnel manager focusing on sub-represented population groups and internal integration efforts."</seg>
<seg id="28">"Zhu also said that she will let her Snapchat account be closed and added," "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it is not O.K."</seg>

<seg id="2">"military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence to record an optimistic image of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, as it allowed the actual conditions on the ground, announced an inquiry committee in a report on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the preliminary report, created by a Task Force of the Republican members of the Joint Military Committee, intelligence committees and military budget, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command Intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments of American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the Central Command, briefly Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia."</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence information, typically enjoyed by high-level Centcom commanders, regularly portrayed a more positive image of American efforts against terrorism as it allowed the actual conditions on the ground and were consistently positive than analyses of other intelligence services," "quoted a newspaper article."</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at the CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when poor analyses are presented to our political leaders," "said Ken Calvert, Republican Member of the House of Representatives."</seg>
<seg id="7">The leadership mistakes in the CentCom extend to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report detailing detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">"although there is no direct evidence suggesting that government leaders under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts face the pressure from their superiors, an optimistic image of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL."</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015, many Central Command Press Releases, comments and statements were clearly more positive than the facts before the congress."</seg>
<seg id="11">"for example, a CentCom member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could already begin in April or May 2015."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Mosul, the second-largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigation, so much is clear." "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congress of Congress from Kansas, in a statement."</seg>
<seg id="14">"from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the heads of Central Command changed the intelligence reports to play down the danger of ISIS in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force in Life after it was played out that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports about the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights while the investigations are continued.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in addition, further investigation of the CentCom reports is ongoing by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defence."</seg>
<seg id="18">"on Thursday, democratic members of the news service committee issued their own findings, which agree with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015, Centcom created a moderately constrained trial for the preparation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," announced the Executive Committee in the House of Representatives, Adam B. Schiff, in a statement. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"this process," "Mr. Schiff," "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," "compensated the morals among analysts and" "gave excessively low space for diverging opinions."</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the democrats indicated no evidence of any intervention of the White House at the CentCom analysts regarding a "determined political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">"last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon general inspector, which were recorded after complaints by Centcom analysts."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on any reports of the Congress, while the investigators of the General Inspector were still under way."</seg>
<seg id="25">"but he also stated that" experts sometimes have divergent opinions about the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the ministry of defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence. "</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions on the issue of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion that has meanwhile been made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).</seg>
<seg id="27">"however, the allegations of the past year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State reminds of inter-activities of more than ten years ago, when a CentCom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a piece about how the then government under George W. Bush anticipated a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion."</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">"last year, the team headed by Mr. Hooker stated that contrary to the government's statements against the oil refineries held by the Islamic State, there would have been no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these provisional refineries would have taken into operation to sell oil on the black market."</seg>
<seg id="31">"this recognition, however, was not published, the Times reported in September."</seg>
<seg id="32">"Centcoms condemnation, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature for its excessive positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate."</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at the Central Command.</seg>

<seg id="2">"one day after having shot three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam made the first two goals for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3-0."</seg>
<seg id="3">"five gates in two games should actually represent memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she could not remember that ever done."</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "I have no idea." "she said."</seg>
<seg id="5">I do not belong to the people who keep their gates in memory.</seg>
<seg id="6">"however, she knows that: the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are equal in their group with the Britons in the first place, who remain undefeated after their 2-0 victory against Japan."</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final match of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">"both teams have already qualified for the quarterfinals, the game will decide which of the two will win the first and second place within their group of six teams."</seg>
<seg id="9">The first placed will take the strong Dutch a little longer from the path that will lead the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">"whatever the game is going on on Saturday, the Americans have fired a surprising whirlwind through their success story, four years after they landed at the last of 12 places at the last London Games."</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">"she grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey racket in her hands (her two older sisters were playing sports at the Drexel University), with 16 years she became national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team."</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the 2008 Olympic Games because she couldn't qualify for the Kader.</seg>
<seg id="14">"then came the year 2012, in which everything went wrong for them and their team."</seg>
<seg id="15">"during the following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, coach of the National Team became a better turn."</seg>
<seg id="16">"a change of culture, a mental change and a physical change," "said Bam."</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the workplace in London we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have the rudder to be able to carry around completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the Torreigen in the first half of the game with a flashback from the local area.</seg>
<seg id="20">"India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament, but the team turned out surprisingly tough and held the score of 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands."</seg>
<seg id="21">"they performed a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then pulled into the middle and knocked the ball into the gate to get the Americans a 2-0 lead."</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">"the Shutout was the first of the entire tournament for the keeper of the US, Jackie Briggs, who previously had to book one gate in each of the previous games."</seg>
<seg id="24">She has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position," said Parnham, but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday. "</seg>

<seg id="1">"in the midst of the age of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline"</seg>
<seg id="2">"wherever you are, how late it is, it's the Olympics."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the events in Rio de Janeiro feel permanent and inevitable, a raging relay race between competition and aspiration."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is as if the olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which is passed from the wristwatch to the swimmer to the turner for triathletes."</seg>
<seg id="5">"you can't turn on television, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the quarrel between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who is at the Olympic Games for the first time, and a women's flock of dimples, could certainly be among the known names sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and well-being TV advertising if he were a swimmers, gymnasts or even fencers."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the olympic tramp gymnastics."</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the centre, partly in the shade are the sports which are not generally accepted: pistol shooting, archery, badminton, Taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the bust and may it rule for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I should make modest arguments for my particular darling, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it was so sparse the last 16 years that many of the guys I had asked didn't know that there is any kind of Olympic sport at all."</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"although the USA sent athletes to compete, there has never won a medal in jumping on the trampoline and had an athlete, who made it to the final round."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for men and the Chinese and Canadians for women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal this year from London.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the trampoline jumping has some outsider charme, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clownsschool than those for the Olympics."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a earthbound enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has humorous potential - the cartoonical trembling of its never-ending prelude - but also the Grazie of the gymnastics and diving, the two sports that it unites essentially."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the word" "trampoline" "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as" "springboard". ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"aspiring conquerors jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to land a number of falling movements (turning, biting and saltos) before they land on the feet."</seg>
<seg id="23">"according to official Olympic programme, they are assessed according to performance, difficulty and" flight time. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="25">The common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">"in their quest for gold, medals need to go further, faster, up and down, sometimes to the finish, sometimes up and down, up and down on the playground."</seg>
<seg id="27">"they not only hunt the finish line or the starting wall, but also another height objective in the television transmission: the world or the Olympiar."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the goal-oriented aspiration is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it's enough to even stir a spectator to tears."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I feel at watching these games as something tiresome.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward motion is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">"he or she bounces off, seemingly weightless as an astronaut, goes up, then downwards, then effortlessly up again."</seg>
<seg id="34">"there is also a competition here, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves into the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity."</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition in the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the women's qualification and final rounds will be held on Friday afternoons, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00."</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will broadcast the final rounds as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in the midst of the Olympia-Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in general tumult."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the fear of being and the objectivity of male athletes - as the male US turner screamed for a short time according to The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Dooley expects his new fan base."</seg>

<seg id="1">"one generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long is an ally of the USA "</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators calling for political changes in Ethiopia met with the government's violent opposition.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that umpteen protesters were killed during clashes with police at firing squads.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just going to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the last ten years, it was one of Africa's most stable countries, a solid ally of the West with a fast growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">"however, protests against the government shook the country in the last months and turned into more and more areas."</seg>
<seg id="8">"last week, thousands of people rushed to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes."</seg>
<seg id="9">"according to human rights organisations, the government's response was merciless."</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses testified that police fired and killed dozens of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in circulation, videos on the protests, which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security professionals strike young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a handstand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights Council is now calling for an in-depth investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa at the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terror hazards beyond the region, in particular in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much Western aid."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has improved drastically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the roads are usually quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organizations have continually led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been limited, and dissidents were effectively silenced."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent into exile or jail, killed or driven into the desks of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and have no other options except to protest, it breaks off," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Ethiopia. "</seg>
<seg id="23">All the youth are protesting.</seg>
<seg id="24">One generation is protesting.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold in relation to power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after a far-critical election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, tensions along the border to Eritrea rise; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June."</seg>
<seg id="28">"analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which have been enforced more or less in recent years, could benefit the turmoil and arm themselves again."</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness explode after years of falling down under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"in recent years, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with the social media since cheaper smartphones have become more and more frequent and the internet services improved."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, which it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they reside."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians admitted that they assembled so to protest.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"for eons, the Amharas, who mainly come from ethic countries, prospered in politics and economy as they exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and live in flat-land areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But this also changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are here to co-ordinate under a umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which accounts for around 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in the military, intelligence, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, served for 17 years until his death in an unpublicized sickness in Ethiopia for 17 years."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was especially versed in perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special commissioners to manipulate enemies and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the present regime lacks this basic skill," "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst."</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailash Desalegn, was selected for relatively obscure reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailash arrives from the South."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time Ethiopia had experienced such a turmoil in 2005, after protests protested against elections, which according to analysts apparently plied by the government and then stolen."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the ensuing raids, many protesters were killed, even if they were less than in the last months and that time of unrest went over relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"development experts praised Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the internal misfortunes of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it assumes a dangerous ethnical form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month protesters attacked Gondar, an amian city, by Tigray, and hatred towards the Tigray is becoming more and more common in social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as the base for Dronenflights over the neighboring Somalia, although it recently announced that it closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile region."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," "said Mr Abdi," "is a very thin tightrope walk."</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his statement Obama has founded ISIS "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">"Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his repeated claim that President Obama and Hillary Clinton had been the" founders "of the terrorist group Islamic State, not serious."</seg>
<seg id="3">"this clarification raised new questions on the communication skills of the Republican presidential candidate, whether he was able to communicate clearly and comprehensively with the American public."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it also brings his comrades who endeavour to take protection during an eventful phase, into the peculiar position, to explain the statements he did not mean at all."</seg>
<seg id="5">"having made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump questioned the allegation on Thursday and insisted on insisting that he really did not intend to suggest that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS."</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the Tweet was contrary to the previous day when Mr. Trump spoke in a number of interviews, he said the accusation was completely serious."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when Hugh Hewitt's conservative Radiomorator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate didn't want to know about it."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the last storm of criticism falls down to Mr. Trump, while he has tried to draw the focus of his campaign for falling demand values on the economic situation."</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">"on Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again."</seg>
<seg id="12">"on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring."</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">"at the end of July he criticised himself as he said that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but he later said," Of course, I thought the sarcastic. "</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone linguistic boundaries in politics and then return to demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are taken up by his fans, how they arrive, and then" clear "depending on how the reaction fails." "said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"but I think he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough, so that they can be interpreted in various ways."</seg>
<seg id="18">"instead of defusing the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has adopted an even more corrosive tone, as his conversion values have gone further."</seg>
<seg id="19">"a new survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was published on Friday, showed a leadership with a great advantage in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida."</seg>
<seg id="20">"while Mr. Trump is generally trying not to apologize for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humour."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but while he reinforces the focus of attention in the last few months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze has brought his loyal comrades into the uncomfortable situation, regardless of how provocative his statements may be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps most prominent advocate, today gave great effort to defend the candidate in a CNN interview of Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political commentaries," said Mr. Giuliani, so he questioned Mr Trumps's statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"it is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown small organization, he called it backbiter, completely wrong and so it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most of the mainstream Republicans try to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to spread out aggressive under control of the situation in the Middle East."</seg>
<seg id="26">"before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of getting around on each of his words and being accused of him."</seg>
<seg id="27">"he moaned the" poor, miserable "television experts who try to understand him and said," You can't!. ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the Democrats mocked Mr. Trumps's apology as a further proof that he was unsuitable for the presidential office.</seg>

<seg id="4">"the store Soap Cherie, replacing the Verb in summer 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes."</seg>
<seg id="5">Locals guessed it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.</seg>
<seg id="6">"the artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter," "I know New York is changing, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is excepted and Verb is now a soap shop."</seg>
<seg id="7">"but when New York is changing, it is also re-invention."</seg>
<seg id="8">"a revived Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the new club has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the new owner of the club is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing employee of the old café, the owner and managing director of the new café."</seg>
<seg id="12">He began to work in Verb in 2001 and remained there until the end.</seg>

<seg id="16">It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment.</seg>
<seg id="18">He introduced new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">"on the menu there are sandwiches with bacon and cheese, and there are garnish tops such as capers and sautéed onions."</seg>
<seg id="20">There are natural attractions.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the café serves no more beer, but there are fresh juices."</seg>
<seg id="22">After nine months Rodriguez said that he noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.</seg>
<seg id="23">"many old customers were also pushed by prices from Williamsburg," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="24">"recently on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer."</seg>

<seg id="36">"in fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to produce a special soap for brew with the cold-brewed coffee of the cafe as an ingredient."</seg>
<seg id="37">"I think we will go into her offer," "said Rodriguez."</seg>
<seg id="38">"and the traditional, Polish inhabitants of Greenpoint have also accepted the café."</seg>

<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," "she said."</seg>
<seg id="6">"her husband Andrew Coe added," "It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat."</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">"COPlast book" "Chop Suey" "was about Chinese cuisine in the USA, while brickman told in her book" 97 Orchard "about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from the food perspective."</seg>
<seg id="9">"her latest collaboration," A decent meal, "which will appear on Tuesday at Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="10">"they showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, frills snack at the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetables."</seg>
<seg id="12">"when the reporter ordered hacket, this found the pair matching the food in the era of Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich food was very popular," "said Ziegelman."</seg>
<seg id="14">"there were peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread."</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and something cheaper that reaches the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them for dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">CoE grinning.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it must have settled in the stomach like lead," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years before Great Depression, the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, an all-You-Can-Eat Buffet."</seg>
<seg id="20">"men's teams cooked for male felines and it was served freshly baked pastas for breakfast, lunch and dinner."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it was Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War." "a Square Meal" "marks the ground with which the country moved to be no longer the country of land."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it was a time when food was a central, sharpened theme for the Americans," "said Coe, why he and his wife wanted to write about it."</seg>
<seg id="23">"the new budget was just as tight: mysterious foods such as breads and casseroles were added to staple foods that recycle casserolle as a" "wonderful way of eating food residue", "Ziegelman noted, because cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce."</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">"meat, which was the center of American cuisine for years, became a rarely served luxury."</seg>
<seg id="26">"peculiar mixes were tested, as a low-calorie and nutritious satisfaction had priority over taste or even healthy common sense."</seg>
<seg id="27">"during her research for the book, which includes recipes, brickman prepared a court of this epoch, baked onions with peanut butter."</seg>
<seg id="28">"it was not a popular addition at noon," Coe says. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"Brickmann continues:" "it was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and baked onions do not match each other.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the domestic recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">"as never before or ever since, fiscal economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - influenced the food habits of the country."</seg>
<seg id="33">"by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become" housekeepers "and the challenge to transform Pampe like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals."</seg>

<seg id="1">Grönlandshark: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland harks usually only come to the surface in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was able to return to the sea after an investigation on board the Sanna research vessel.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland harks receive up to 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">"leisurely, the Greenland swims along the ground of the North Atlantic, in an hour it comes on average just 1.220 meters wide."</seg>
<seg id="8">"only when it comes to it, the five-metre-long animal accelerates at satte 2,6 km / h - and with this top speed is half as fast as a seal."</seg>
<seg id="9">"this lifestyle, characterised by slowness, seems to be a patronage for a high age."</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" at least from a Grönkhai who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"insanity," comments Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this lifespan that represents a world record for vertebrates. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"admittedly, the evolutionary biologist supposes that Greenland will be stone-old."</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland harks are difficult to observe, after all, they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergen."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in the winter on the surface."</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland.</seg>
<seg id="17">"their time-pentecamping became to them, when they paid six animals with a transmitter before Svalbard."</seg>
<seg id="18">"loot still make this sharks: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear."</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly they chase sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice-sea and look for cadaver that torches from higher layers of water down.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland harks who took fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long, while the largest 502 centimetre measured."</seg>
<seg id="22">"to determine the age of the animals, they analysed the lens core of the sharks with the carbon-14 method."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eye lens is created before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it will no longer be renewed."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had strikingly much carbon-14 in the lenticular nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">"therefore, their birth should be after the early 1960s, when atomic weapons attempt to inject large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"on the other hand, in the third-smallest animal in the length of 220 centimeters, the lenticular nucleus, on the other hand, contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons attempt, so it should have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">"all larger Greenland harks, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 quantities in their lenticular nucleus, resulting in cosmic radiation in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon-14 clock showed an age of 335 years for a 493 centimeter long Grönlandshark, while the record shark with 502 centimetres might even be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="29">"only then, that Grönkhai-females get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known."</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to assign age to an old age.</seg>
<seg id="31">"since one of the animals with 392 centimetres probably stood on the threshold to the sexually mature and its age with 156 years was determined, Greenland sharks with the increase obviously can be at least one and a half centuries time."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">"that such methusalemes live mainly in icy waters, is no coincidence."</seg>
<seg id="34">"the previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland-whale, in whose bacon at the neck became a 120-year-old harpoon tip, was caught in front of Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there frequently runs on a flame of asparagus."</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age more slowly.</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are often very large."</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal loses heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much bigger than with one gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as possible," "explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein."</seg>
<seg id="42">"a very large animal, on the other hand, should invest its resources in a long life."</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministers from the pastoral care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way for a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">"together, four stages were dealt with."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in order to bridge the time until the next pilgrimage of all ministrants to the next two years, the Ministerial Conference of St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage."</seg>
<seg id="5">"various pilgrimage destinations have been tested and one finally decided to visit the Episcopal city of Freiburg, where this year, during the Holy Year of the Mercy with the opened gate of Mercy at the Freiburg cathedral, a special pilgrimage destination was offered."</seg>
<seg id="6">"16 Minis of Bittelbronn, Grubenol, and Haigerloch, and holy rooms set themselves on the way."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in the evening before, priest Storost sent pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrim crosses and parted the pilgrim's blessings."</seg>
<seg id="8">"from Horb was driven by train to the starting point Villingen, where also a Münster dearly loved woman is standing and so the pilgrimage route from Münster started."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening by a short impulse with different prayers, songs and written texts."</seg>
<seg id="10">"but also on the way, the Minis stopped at field crossings, chapels or churches again and again to sing together a song of specially arranged pilgrim song."</seg>
<seg id="11">"for the overnight stays, parishioners of the local parishes were available."</seg>
<seg id="12">"on the stages, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty and tasty dinner and breakfast."</seg>

<seg id="15">The deserved reward was a common grilling on the badger in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="16">"after the morning impulse on the fourth pilgrimage day in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter, the final stage went to Freiburg."</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner last night in the men team Sprint in the Velodrom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy made to Eigen, who made the legend proud when he stormed home to capture a victory from the favourites New Zealand."</seg>
<seg id="4">"England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals."</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after having won only a modest sixth place in March at the London Underground Championships in London.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as a hindrance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retired a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Skinner was the man with whom they stayed as they saw potential in the Scots, which now unfolded."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Hinder, Kenny - four years ago with Hoy winning - and Skinner clinched an olympic record in the qualification rounds, but in the standard rounds, the New Zealanders won the first round."</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Hinder fell short after his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it."</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a major part of the transformation taking place in a higher gear to slow down and allow Kenny and above all skinner to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Hoy looked at his position as BBC expert and dropped Skinner, Kenny and Hinds when they climbed onto the podium."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "it's a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I am only here to do my best and make a name for myself.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set up an Olympic track in the final round and defeated the World Champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">"after the triumph of 2012 on the Kennys and Hoys site, Hinder added that after a weak start he was deliberately dropped onto the track."</seg>
<seg id="21">He later withdrew this statement and there was no objection from England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">This time there was no such problem with such an outstanding victory.</seg>
<seg id="23">"that said," It feels like all the UK flags on the grandstand like London. "</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">"so many world titles have come so badly, that it was unbelievable to win again at the Olympics."</seg>
<seg id="26">"this is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which was won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London."</seg>
<seg id="27">"if this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect successful five days in the velodrome."</seg>
<seg id="28">"with the shape of Kennys, it is in the field of possible that he repeated Hoys win of three Olympic gold medals in a competition."</seg>
<seg id="29">"this would be for Kenny - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on 23 March (a seemingly holy date for British sports; on the day also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal."</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same from Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Kenny is next in the sprint, which starts today and will go for more than three days."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the 28-year-old from Bolton said:" "I enjoy this only for the moment."</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"he said:" "if he wins two other gold medals he should be beaten to the knight."</seg>
<seg id="37">"it was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometre race."</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived in 3: 51.942.</seg>
<seg id="40">"the world record, which won gold in London in 2012, was at 3: 51,659."</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will be held on the second day of the competition where Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">He had argued with officers before the qualification yesterday when officials called him to measure his height.</seg>
<seg id="43">"Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shandong, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13,260."</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team is relying on its strong platform team to dominate the medium period of the Olympic Games and get a par of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">"after a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio were shut down."</seg>
<seg id="46">"there was drama in the background, so the resignation of Shane Sutton's technical director Shane Sutton in April surrounded by sexism and mobbling blocks as well as retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton."</seg>
<seg id="47">"however, if one sees the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom it looks like the legendary reputation of GBs, which reached its climax at the perfect moment, will be repeated again."</seg>

<seg id="1">Future of the melt of Portland due to lifting of the energy contract questionable</seg>
<seg id="2">"the future of the aluminum melts in Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workstations of workers - are at stake, as the plant operator terminates the energy supply contract, thereby raising all supply contracts, as the supplying energy company is sharing."</seg>
<seg id="3">"this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria early this year, no further subsidies to operate the plant."</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy that was established for 20 years runs out in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">"up to 2,000 jobs in the installation of Alcoa in Portland are at stake."</seg>
<seg id="6">No less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be endangered at a closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in addition, it could come to domino effects as the melt is consumed around 10 percent of the entire generation of Victorias."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in 2014 Alcoa closed the Point Henry melt, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year."</seg>
<seg id="9">The melt of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">"this step follows the years of speculation about the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and finally due to the electricity price for the plant."</seg>
<seg id="11">"AGL, supplying the large aluminium melt with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three more owners will announce their contracts."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the plant is owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, which holds the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp smaller portions."</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity by the melt," said the company. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"AGL continued to say that the contracts were so-called" "hedging transactions" "that should have entered into force from November 2016."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the contracts have a 12 month notice period, so that they will end in 2017."</seg>
<seg id="16">"therefore, AGL expects that the contracts in the fiscal year 17 will contribute to revenues," "said the electricity supplier."</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential effects on the earnings to AGL from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL announced that the value of the contracts had already been depreciated in the amount of $187 million in anticipation of a cancellation.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Alcoa said that the decision to withdraw the contracts, the" Ability Alcoas... to operate the melt, or to ensure the electricity supply to the melt "do not interfere."</seg>
<seg id="20">"the US company said that in 2010, it concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang that would have come into force from November this year even if there is yet another explanation why it has resigned from the contract."</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts warn of the bad economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in reference to the analysts' statements at the beginning of the week, Head of Operations, Stephen Mikkelsen, said that Portland will consume around 600 MW and Tomago some 900 megawatts of electricity per year."</seg>
<seg id="23">"should both systems disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [electricity market]."</seg>
<seg id="24">"and for us as a generating set, it wouldn't be good," he said. "</seg>

<seg id="4">"in a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover brought me to cry," Kendall wrote. "</seg>

<seg id="6">"that puts the cliché-hive action almost every birthday of a child's show (Seacrest brought the sentence," "You thought we had forgotten you?", "with the honesty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girl take part in this publicity."</seg>
<seg id="7">"with regard to the September edition of the Vogue, a new era of the Kardashian began with certainty."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Kendall's big sister Kim likes her, as far as the Vogue cover is concerned (she and her husband Kanye West were on it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself."</seg>
<seg id="9">The September edition is the most saleable issue of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">"with a circumference that resembles more an illustrated book than a fashion magazine, the output attracts a large number of advertisers (According to Fashionista were of the 832 pages of the roller 615 pages advertising)."</seg>
<seg id="11">The unveiling of his cover stars is so eagerly awaited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine still leaked before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">"women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in recent years there were clearly more" celebrities that mockle "as" models, which are celebrities "on the cover."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Oscar-winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga had the honor."</seg>
<seg id="15">"but even with the small chance that Mrs. Jenner, who is described by the magazine as the" breakthrough model "of her generation - falls under the former category, is in good company."</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous persons or reality stars or youngsters of today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even though it applies to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade."</seg>
<seg id="19">"of course, Jenners's success doesn't like everyone."</seg>
<seg id="20">"with their reality TV story, Jenners' position in the fashion world was always a little tense."</seg>
<seg id="21">In June the former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid called her "The Mistakes of the Eye."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings sounded very high when the news came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But lying around seems to pass by at the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.</seg>

<seg id="2">E-Mail and Internet in slow motion: 20 years ago the Nokia Communicator came to the market.</seg>
<seg id="3">The successors dominate the world today - its producer experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was thicker and larger, so it was not good in hand."</seg>
<seg id="6">"on the contrary, it was quite clumsy."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the built-in memory initially was eight megabytes, which would be enough today for about two selfies with high resolution."</seg>
<seg id="8">An iPhone is now shipped with at least 16 gigabytes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"the" Nokia 9000 Communicator "came to business exactly 20 years ago, on August 15th, 1996, and it was the first smartphone."</seg>
<seg id="10">"for a few Euros, fans can still buy the equipment on the internet, but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age."</seg>
<seg id="11">"20 years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation."</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair Cebit in Hanover as an office in the west pocket format.</seg>
<seg id="13">"in fact, the new mobile phone could have a lot for those standards: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even by fax the communicator was to be reached."</seg>
<seg id="14">"even the access to web pages was possible by HTML browsers, even if tormenting slowly."</seg>
<seg id="15">"a calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar."</seg>
<seg id="16">"there was a small antenna, and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop."</seg>
<seg id="17">Then there was a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the price was quite proud: 2700 D-Mark, thus about 1400 euros."</seg>
<seg id="19">The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">No one could suspect in August 1996 that the communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">"since then, everything has been different."</seg>
<seg id="22">Smart phones are a success story if not for Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="23">"the Finns' mobile phone segment experienced an unprecedented disaster, eventually sold to Microsoft and handled."</seg>
<seg id="24">Today providers dominate the market which came all a lot later than Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="25">"always and everywhere online, this is today for a lot of people everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in 2015, there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="27">"about 1.4 billion devices have been sold, and Samsung and Apple alone account for 555 million units."</seg>
<seg id="28">Worldwide sales with the equipment is around 400 billion euros.</seg>

<seg id="2">"Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country."</seg>
<seg id="3">"for me, this was the biggest attraction of Heathrow, just as in 2012 in London, when we had a great effort to ensure that all of our nations and regions benefited from the games."</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">"we will already have 10,000 new apprenticeships for our local communities alone, to create 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment."</seg>
<seg id="7">"as they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of the extension Heathrow is too big."</seg>
<seg id="8">I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we'll be blaming on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">There are always obstacles to overcome but Heathrow answers any asked question.</seg>
<seg id="11">"like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for single an infrastructure project."</seg>
<seg id="12">"expansion is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in real estate growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both to the airport and to the UK."</seg>
<seg id="13">"we have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from the T5 - the five years as a result of the world's best airport terminal, to T2, which was built in the midst of the two most frequented catwalks in the world."</seg>
<seg id="14">"now they are ready to deliver a third catwalk, which is supported by £16 billion in private investments."</seg>
<seg id="15">The London Games of 2012 were a big success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.</seg>

<seg id="4">The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.</seg>
<seg id="5">"a woman lay in the dark" in an act of despair "on the street and were hit by several cars, the police said in Vaud."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it is obvious that a Swiss at the age of 49, which was crossed by several vehicles, including a lorry, wanted to kill himself."</seg>
<seg id="7">She still died on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="8">"several drivers have already been heard, but some have still not been identified, said the police, who called these as well as any witnesses of the incident to report."</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably inhabited once."</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies at NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the model was designed to determine whether Venus could once have revealed similar conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow revolution of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">"but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, earthen-like atmosphere and still turned out slowly."</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the planet probably referred to more dry areas than de Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to host lives and protected from quick evaporation."</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow revolution of Venus exhibits its day-side of the sun for almost two months," explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"this warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like a umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat."</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degree cooler than that of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus that resembles evolution that was previously suspected of planetary scientists.</seg>
<seg id="14">"although it was presumably inhabitable, Venus -- in the course of several billions years --was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light."</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burnt away by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">"as their hydrogen, there remained only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus, which as we know it today."</seg>

<seg id="1">Dataklau: so perfide erpressing hackers its ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful in doing so.</seg>
<seg id="3">"according to a recent survey by the malware defense specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past twelve months have at least once, some multiple victims of an attack with blackmail software."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in Germany, nearly 20 percent of the companies were already the target of a ransomware solution."</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of victims readily paid the ransom demanded by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their blackmail software according to the observations of Malwarebytes to attack attacks in company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">"if they are successful there, the potential to blackmail money is significantly higher than with private users."</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a terrifying rapid evolution of the malware," says Malwarebytes manager Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world." "</seg>
<seg id="9">"in 2008, most of the malwareprogrammes were designed to send advertising."</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">"first of all, private users were the target, but the change to company attacks was terrifying in the past few months."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once active on a victim's computer, it searches for recently modified files such as Word-, Excel or database files, as well as archives of pictures and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and erases the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the receivables of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">"to get the final key code to the files, the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of the Cryptostate Bitcoin."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but where private users use the personal photo database on the game, companies are dealing with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production is shut down."</seg>
<seg id="17">"accordingly, the damage occurs when a ransomware hits."</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 percent of the affected German companies reported sales losses due to Ransomware, 13 per cent even had to break the business activity completely, in one case people were in danger of life."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks, whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we always say to the victims: don't pay, you only promote the problem," Kleczynski explains. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"however, 80 to 90 percent of companies pay their data again."</seg>
<seg id="22">"for managers, it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators in the face of stagnation in the company."</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers in turn know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in a recent study, the safety researchers of F-Secure have examined the user surfaces and contact with the blackmail and comes to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they tell their victims per chat how they can pay per Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites or decrypt free sample files for free."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and will private individuals receive payments of a few hundred euros, companies must negotiate hardships and pay five-digit sums to get their data unencrypted."</seg>
<seg id="27">"given the potentially high and relatively risky gains from the ransomware blackmail, the hackers become more and more professional and share the work, declares Security expert Chester Wisniewski from antivirus provider SOPHOS:" a single person can write a ransomware roughly within a week. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"however, it is more likely that it is three or four persons."</seg>

<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use</seg>
<seg id="3">"Honda wants to pack everything in the small HR-V: a little SUV, a little coupé and even the versatility of a minivan."</seg>
<seg id="4">"sounds pretty much overloaded, but the HR-V, which has been constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="5">"although the only 1.60 m high HR-V is rather small, the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear, it doesn't work in any place."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the materials of the interior are well finished and have a pleasant effect, only the cockpit top is falling down somewhat."</seg>
<seg id="7">More versatile than comparable cars is the HR-V in the storage box.</seg>
<seg id="8">"there is not only a trunk of 453 l in case of high-featured and 1026 l in case of retrofit back rests, but there is the" Magic Seats. ""</seg>
<seg id="9">"this is less magical than it sounds: the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like cinema chairs and thus offer storage space, which is 1,24 m high from the floor to ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the trunk can be loaded well, however, the loading height with 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008."</seg>
<seg id="11">The 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide rpm ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">"however, he should do something quieter in his work."</seg>
<seg id="13">Pleasing is the daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km.</seg>

<seg id="15">A four-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>

<seg id="19">"the safety systems include the City emergency brake assistant (works up to speed 32), the collision warning system and the lane support assistant."</seg>
<seg id="20">"the collision warning sometimes irritates, because he evaluates many obstacles as" "approaching objects" "when manoeuvring."</seg>
<seg id="21">The high-beam assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent speed control reacts to the traffic sign detection and throttles the speed if required.</seg>
<seg id="23">"but the full connectivity is only available for the top features: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation device, app integration and more."</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB and one HDMI connector lie under the armrest and are therefore somewhat cumbersome to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="25">"the roughly 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine."</seg>
<seg id="26">"those who don't want to invest so much will receive the gasoline engine from 20000 Euro, the diesel from 23,000 euros."</seg>

<seg id="2">"in the evening you roll around forever, at night you lie awake for hours; in the morning, there is no longer thinking of sleep before the wake-up ring."</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after all, one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of the adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing."</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep problems manifest?</seg>
<seg id="6">"there are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many causes behind them, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeder, member of the board member of the German Society for sleep control and sleeping medicine."</seg>
<seg id="7">"what one understands for the moment, however, is the insomnia, that is, an inhalation and sleep disturbance."</seg>
<seg id="8">"as a result of sleep, many people feel as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board of the German House Medical Association with practice in the lower Saxony Varel."</seg>
<seg id="9">What's behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">"behind it can be organic, mental or behavioral factors, but also drugs."</seg>
<seg id="12">Infrequently sleep disturbance is an expression of another disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early awakening is common in depression," says Weeder. "</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors require one another.</seg>
<seg id="15">"for example, who has a herniated disc, can lie poorly, wakes up every two to three hours, and possibly starts to ponder about everyday problems and worries, there is an example."</seg>
<seg id="16">"this leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible."</seg>
<seg id="17">When should you become a doctor with insomnia?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week should go to the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="19">"the impairment may look quite different: one is beaten, tired, sleepy, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical complaints such as stomach or headaches."</seg>
<seg id="20">"to relieve sleep disturbance, it is important to find out their causes."</seg>
<seg id="21">"treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, or medication - classic sleep tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks."</seg>
<seg id="22">"there is hardly any left-handed sleep medicine in Germany, stressed Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary dormitory medical center of the Charité University Medicine Berlin."</seg>
<seg id="23">"for this reason, one should first turn to the primary doctor in case of sleep problems, but he advises."</seg>
<seg id="24">It can be resolved with research whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">"who should go to sleep, and what happens?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"for example, for snoring with breathing dropouts, for example in snoring with breathing dropouts, for abnormal fatigue, in sleep transformers or if one does not find the cause of a sleep disturbance, it explains fistiness."</seg>
<seg id="27">It is not necessary to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"please don't make a nap," "says Fietze."</seg>
<seg id="30">After the scaling one goes to bed at his normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">"in addition to the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose-glasses, a chest strap and a feeler at the finger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"in addition, a camera records the sleeping-ends at the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="33">How can those affected get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of adjusting screws you can use for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">"weeds count on: regular sleep and downtime, not lying too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, do not watch TV to sleep, avoid alcohol and not watch at night at night - then you start calculating immediately, and that's not conducive."</seg>

<seg id="1">"old buildings, some linden trees, in between there is still a rest of cobblestones: the Riga street in Berlin-Friedrichshain doesn't seem so at first sight, but the police count them to the" dangerous places "of the city."</seg>

<seg id="3">"on the facade of a grey house, someone has sprayed" ugly! ""</seg>
<seg id="4">"compared to a Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here until 2017."</seg>
<seg id="5">"however, in recent weeks articles about this" "trendy neighborhood", "as the competent real estate company Friedrichshain, are favored with burning cars."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, the residents now have rental agreements, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events."</seg>
<seg id="7">"since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin interior senator Henkel has spoken several times for a hard approach by the police against the project, the area referred to as" no-go zone "for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="8">"on 22 June, the rooms on the ground floor, the cadaforge, with 300 police officers, patrogated the police for three weeks, according to official statements, with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site, locked off parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94."</seg>
<seg id="9">"meanwhile, building workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners."</seg>
<seg id="10">"on 13 July, a Berlin administrative court ruled that the clearance had been illegal and a day later police and construction workers moved under the jubilation of sympathizers and residents."</seg>
<seg id="11">"on this summer afternoon, the street works peacefully: parents go for a walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk about late late."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the immediate vicinity of the house projects, there is a primary school and kindergartens."</seg>
<seg id="13">"left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who has three children here, are mainly stressed by the police presence."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with the inhabitants of the house projects, they share the concern for increasing rents and gentrification."</seg>
<seg id="15">"it does not sound like a Kiez, who wished mostly police protection against vandaliatory leftists."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the ditch, which the Berlin interior senator and the police open between house occupiers and their neighbors, obviously does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working-class district, which, in comparison to the rest of the city, has a lower average income and a high risk of poverty."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer Strasse in the vicinity of the Riga."</seg>
<seg id="19">"while the Mainz was cleared by a large police force in a regular street battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Riga and are still inhabited by the people they had occupied 26 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, the neighborhood has become a magnet for tourists and choice liners from all over the world over the past few years: residents from GDR times and former home-owned landowners share their neighbourhood with them."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is also reflected in the rents, which have increased by almost 60 per cent since 2009."</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rīga are attacked as symbols for this development: they recognize them on thrown slices or freshly painted façades thrown with dyes.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road was mentioned this year together with the words "left-autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">"one reason for not all neighbours to view this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crime, such as bodily injury, are almost exclusively directed against policemen."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most of the offences make material damage, which tend to meet the new buildings and newly renovated houses."</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a rental house next to the disputed 94 for 17 years, uncertainty cannot be of uncertainty."</seg>
<seg id="27">"as far as violence is concerned, it is important: the people in the 94 are their neighbours who have not been this."</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars no longer exist in the Rīga.</seg>
<seg id="29">"for the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focus, on the contrary:" here one helps one another, lives together on the road and gets more from each other than elsewhere. "</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is deliberately drawn into the Riga street - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">"that is why it was also so important that people get back to their streets: from police, politics and media, which in July all suddenly claimed the interpretation sovereignty over the district."</seg>
<seg id="32">"but in the eyes of residents such as Neugebauer, the street will continue to be taken away: by faceless new buildings in former building spaces that the old inhabitants supplant."</seg>
<seg id="33">"in the end they are condominiums which are not interesting for many here - here people live rather people who are not so good," "she says."</seg>
<seg id="34">"I absolutely cannot approve of violence and destruction." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what can you do if someone never listens to it?</seg>
<seg id="36">"there is frustration on all sides, including the police and residents."</seg>
<seg id="37">"Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for drains who are annoyed about color bombs, the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez."</seg>

<seg id="6">"she sees herself as a contact partner for all actors: refugees, working groups refugee aid, administration, authorities and anyone else."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Regine Customer of the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the eiving wool-milk-sau, which above all has a problem."</seg>
<seg id="8">"for example, some - less ridiculing than much rather than the multitude of desired areas - meant that the administration wanted to write down the job."</seg>
<seg id="9">"an administrative faculty with a talent for languages and people, coupled with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, has been sought."</seg>
<seg id="10">"but administrative work is not its central area, meaning Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="11">"above all, it is about organization, work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activities."</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent position on three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine customer, that Annika Deuschle supports honest and full actors. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"there are big and small problems, organizational, human and communication problems."</seg>
<seg id="16">New containers will soon be placed in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">It has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees who have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection provision.</seg>
<seg id="19">You must bring the refugees in their own or hired living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the costs for the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the communes themselves."</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the district council to the commune and job center.</seg>
<seg id="22">"problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment."</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">"de facto, the administration does not find private apartments."</seg>
<seg id="25">"it didn't work so far, it was necessary to rely on private dwellings, so Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, common dwellings must be intimidated as it is so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="27">New containers will soon be erected in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">"but only with apartments, it is not done."</seg>
<seg id="29">"perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in addition to a permanent residence there are internships, apprenticeships, school grounds, one-euro jobs and backup activities for refugees and migrants who need to be wounded or set up."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," Regine customer reports. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the building yard or help housewives, do charitable work - and that motivates and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports."</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that working for the community leads to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this is" "no job therapy." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer."</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a feeling of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so I need offers like sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">"so here, administration and volunteers are also jumping."</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"they have to explain the refugees that it takes a long time to bridge over time, for example with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"those who develop the feeling sometime, can't help in Urbach, do not work and be useless, he will never be able to integrate."</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"but there is also problem cases, says customer honestly," people with nothing at all. "the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others."</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a mammoth task.</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: do the two have fear of radicalisation after the recent occurrences, even in a small community like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," "Regine customer says clearly," "what some naïve might call." "a residual risk could and does not want to exclude them."</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the assassins kill them completely.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine Customer. "</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">"thus, the main and honorary official must look for activities in the region and in the region."</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that a new push to refugees and migrants will soon come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">"to answer this question clearly, politics is afraid."</seg>
<seg id="59">"actually, it is unfair to put them helpers on the spot."</seg>
<seg id="60">"we haven't arrived in Urbach where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle. "</seg>
<seg id="61">"no new refugees, that would relax the situation."</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbach are already busy to integrate the previous people sensibly.</seg>
<seg id="63">"these are currently around 100 people, mostly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree."</seg>
<seg id="65">"the political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers."</seg>
