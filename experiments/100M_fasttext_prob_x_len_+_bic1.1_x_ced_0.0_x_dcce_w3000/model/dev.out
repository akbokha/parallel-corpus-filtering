Obama welcomes Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to discuss the implementation of the international agreement and to Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing policies in the Middle East .
&quot; at the meeting , however , it should also be about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critici@@ zes Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement construction and repro@@ aches Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
&quot; through the deal promoted by Obama for the Iranian nuclear programme , the relationship of the two has further deterior@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans before the US Congress , which was partly regarded as an aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had rejected it with reference to the election that was im@@ minent in Israel . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , professor is required to have shot his girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his home . &quot;
&quot; Lamb was important to emphasize that his &quot; swe@@ eter dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; inside the house the officials found the corp@@ se of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was stuck on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry I wanted , I could reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was written according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that Lamb , who traveled in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds where he shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office . &quot;
Delta State University police officer Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university employees have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb made the fatal emergency call afterwards .
until the end of the day there was another death : Lamb took life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
&quot; one day after shooting at the university , which forced students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb moti@@ oned . &quot;
&quot; the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher . &quot;
students said they were looking forward to his teaching .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or criminal pre@@ history . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students attended courses of both . &quot;
at the same time there were some inclin@@ ations to problematic behavior .
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he also seemed a bit nervous and nervous as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that Lamb had told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University to appeal for health reasons and said he had any health problem .
this year he only taught two online courses .
&quot; recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy mean that the promotion , for which Lamb had worked so hard for him , would not constitute a guarantee for an automatic path to employment as Assistant Professor . &quot;
&quot; President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ b &apos;s performance . &quot;
these are questions that Lamb cannot answer any more .
&quot; after escap@@ ing from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ b track when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as . &quot;
&quot; before he could be arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that they believed that he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
Lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; Lamb began his work at the university in 2009 , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city of about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y . &quot;
he completed his doctorate in spring in pedago@@ gi@@ cs .
&quot; one of the long @-@ term friends Lam@@ bs called him intellig@@ ently , charism@@ atic and funny . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 , and Lamb was 20 when they met through common friends . &quot;
&quot; she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar playing . &quot;
&quot; at that time , he was the women &apos;s flock . &quot;
&quot; all the girls were melting away when he was there , &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; in the emergency call , Lamb &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate of a marriage . &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said that they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends had stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail stood on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together the one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked online for various companies .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ tender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a poorly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said he saw Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5th September for the last time , after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica game before a spar@@ se audience . &quot;
there was no indication that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were at the clearing and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of joke .
&quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , directed the first semester seminar program and specialized in American native and colonial history , Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school . &quot;
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his Brotherhood and the student committee .
&quot; on Tuesday evening around 900 people , including lec@@ turers , employees , students and members of the congregation took part in a cand@@ l@@ eli@@ ght memorial service on the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the vi@@ gil , while the Univers@@ it√§@@ tsch@@ or &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang . &quot;
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students back to their return , &quot; La@@ For@@ ge said . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
&quot; A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; Associ@@ ated Press authors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebe@@ cca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story was corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that Lamb in his emergency call called Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married . &quot;
To@@ ys R Us planning to hire less workers for Christmas time
&quot; To@@ ys R Us says that there will not be so many Christmas @-@ season employees as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give up the current employee and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours . &quot;
&quot; the company said that it was planning to employ 40,000 people in stores and sales centers throughout the country . in the 2014 Christmas season , 45@@ ,000 workers were recru@@ ited . &quot;
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said that this month it will start with job interviews and the number of employees rises from October to December .
&quot; while the holidays are still months away , Christmas business is approaching , and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equip and sell shops with employees that sell , ship and deliver products . &quot;
Michael J. Fox cul@@ min@@ ates over his &quot; date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of Back to the Future was a great time for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the film begins , and it comes to mind that I am a simulated link and an arm &apos;s length from being with the princess of Wales on a date . &quot;
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about Back to the Future , presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , together with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; back for the Future &quot; had its premiere 30 years ago .
&quot; it &apos;s really good for me , &quot; Spiel@@ berg said , &quot; Un@@ str@@ it@@ ably the biggest time travel film ever shot . &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and selected cinem@@ as in October . &quot;
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s enhanced military support for Syria is , &quot; There is no military solution &quot; of the almost five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN boss once again calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution . &quot;
&quot; ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - the US , Russia , China , the United Kingdom and France - on the br@@ ink of the meeting of the General Assembly in order to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
he regre@@ ts that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; make this situation un@@ sol@@ vable . &quot;
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity to deal with the crisis in Syria that they have proven in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 survey values that show that Donald Tru@@ mp is taken seriously .
some have tried to brand him out as a flop .
others have dismissed it as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tru@@ mp from the top ranks in p@@ olls , it has ( yet ) not worked . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tru@@ mp in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the rewards of the nom@@ ination of real estate Mog@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot;
nobody claims that Tru@@ mp is likely to win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts emphasize that at that time , in 2011 , Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising Her@@ man Cain , none of whom only won a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders such as J@@ eb Bush &apos;s Super PAC@@ S and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognize Tru@@ mp@@ s staying power and begin to let down their dollars to overthrow him .
here are some current survey data suggest@@ ing that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
Tru@@ mp@@ s Any values have rot@@ ated by 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tru@@ mp announced his candi@@ dat@@ ure in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University revealed that only two of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l . &quot;
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August there were 52 percent .
&quot; now , six of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tru@@ mp . &quot;
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are held in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tru@@ mp .
two thirds of GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
&quot; in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C pol@@ l last week , 67 percent of the re@@ public@@ ans said they were either &quot; delighted &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tru@@ mp was nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two out of 10 say they were &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates roughly the same enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent say they were &quot; thrilled &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about Tru@@ mp ) .
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of the Republi@@ can voters say they were &quot; &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate . &quot;
a majority of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans does not see Tru@@ mp@@ s temper@@ ament as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely critici@@ zed for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 per cent of the Irish voters who are among the re@@ public@@ ans believe that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temp@@ er for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is considered in the first pre @-@ election state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to execute his office effectively , and almost six of 10 independ@@ ents say his temp@@ er didn &apos;t fit into the White House , so ABC / Post . &quot;
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
&quot; when they expose their scholars , Republi@@ can voters hold Tru@@ mp for real . &quot;
&quot; if they are asked who best wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , after a pol@@ l of CN@@ N / OR@@ C from last week four out of ten that Tru@@ mp is the best bet . &quot;
this is a change since the time when four of ten of July took their money on J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
&quot; at this point in the last cycle , four of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination against only 28 % for the final Candi@@ date Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; however , it shows that a variety of GO@@ P voters see Tru@@ mp@@ s campaign as plau@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; even when the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tru@@ mp is still beating almost everyone . &quot;
&quot; some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to Tru@@ mp@@ s leadership , while anti @-@ trust support is distributed over more than a dozen other candidates . &quot;
&quot; but a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tru@@ mp and most other republi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp has picked up the majority support . &quot;
&quot; he points ahead of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points ahead , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a tight majority of Donald Tru@@ mp fans say they have formed their minds .
&quot; a new survey conducted by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support Tru@@ mp , say they have tim@@ ed their votes . &quot;
&quot; of course , a lot can happen to change that , and no one can really say that never change the mind . &quot;
46 percent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
&quot; nevertheless , Tru@@ mp@@ s is the strongest competitor at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as common for Tru@@ mp . &quot;
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say they agree with Tru@@ mp on the subject of immigration .
&quot; since Donald Tru@@ mp , in his election campaign , called immigrants from Mexico two months ago , was the immigration of the shooting and pi@@ vot@@ al point in the public discourse in 2016 . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tru@@ mp will keep decisive His@@ pan@@ o Americans away from the Republi@@ can party and damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
but according to the new ABC / Post @-@ survey of Monday six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say they agree with Tru@@ mp on questions of immigration .
&quot; so long as the immigration remains in the spotlight , Donald Tru@@ mp seems to do it . &quot;
the fru@@ stration of the government is climbing to new high@@ s .
&quot; at Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son , about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , above all , is due to their out@@ si@@ ders status . &quot;
&quot; six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post , they rather want a political out@@ sider than anyone with government experience . &quot;
and they are also angry at Washington .
&quot; a survey conducted by D@@ es Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa Two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans are frustr@@ ated about the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hell@@ ish . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany &quot;
here in the Hob@@ ook@@ out there is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea .
&quot; in the street , a square meter of a rear roof house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros . &quot;
&quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; says it in the study - therefore the high price . &quot;
a new study shows in which areas a square meter costs the most .
&quot; of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residential sites , however , the price comes as pe@@ an@@ uts . &quot;
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; V√∂lk@@ ers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German locations - with square footage in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
&quot; there are several tens of thousands of euros - per square meter , well @-@ recorded . &quot;
but good who can afford it ...
&quot; by the way : Munich is , as an exception , not at the top . &quot;
champi@@ ons League : Bavaria &apos;s dream start thanks to M√ºller and G√∂t@@ ze
tw@@ o@@ fold scor@@ er in Pi@@ raeus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas M√ºller has just one run .
a lucky hit by Thomas M√ºller paved the way to a deserved 3 : 0 at the Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ raeus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ elu@@ de to the Champions League season .
&quot; world champion Thomas M√ºller and Mario G√∂t@@ ze gave the FC Bayern a dream start to the &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; in the Hex@@ enk@@ essel of Pi@@ raeus . &quot;
the team of coach P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won her kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record master Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to M√ºll@@ ers double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and G√∂tz@@ fri@@ es hits ( 8@@ 9. ) with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ fth starting success in series should be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to bring the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt . &quot;
&quot; in his 28 matches in the Champions League for the Bavarian leadership , M√ºller was rewarded with the help of Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto , who had passed a shot of the World Champion as a flan@@ k . &quot;
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; Bavaria @-@ captain Philipp L@@ ahm had promised before the match in the Kar@@ ais@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 3@@ 1@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich held word . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated image without shining .
&quot; Pi@@ re@@ aus had won his most recent six home @-@ games in the King class , among them famous clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ √©@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund stum@@ bled here ( 1 : 3 ) .
&quot; but the Bav@@ arians , defeated in seven European @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they went cour@@ age@@ ously , but often too in@@ conspic@@ uous with their offensive efforts . &quot;
&quot; the attacks were often initiated by means of a game reloc@@ ation to the left @-@ hand side of Douglas Costa , which was rarely interrupted by O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i &apos;s former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i . &quot;
M√ºller was more lucky from the right when his flan@@ k was hit from the right half @-@ field in the left upper corner of the gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion announced the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
&quot; first , when the Olympi@@ ac@@ os stor@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown hit the pol@@ o of Poland from the line ( 26 ) . &quot;
&quot; then by direct action , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto was par@@ ked with his knee ( 3@@ 5. ) . &quot;
&quot; although the Bav@@ arians were accustomed to playing domin@@ ating game , Pi@@ re@@ aus could put needle @-@ stit@@ ches . &quot;
but at Tor@@ ub@@ ter Manuel Neu@@ er was a decree .
&quot; for instance , when he drew a shot from Ide@@ ye on the latte ( 5@@ 6th ) . &quot;
&quot; before New , Guardi@@ ola made a four @-@ way @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng which made it good . &quot;
&quot; Mario G√∂t@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the cad@@ re , sat outside . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup hero only gave the green light after the final training , &quot; said sports director Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; who wants to make something different from it , that &apos;s already malign@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; even during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) . &quot;
&quot; Got@@ ze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter M√ºller still put on it . &quot;
&quot; before the game , it was in the stadium in Kra@@ v@@ ale . &quot;
&quot; after a smaller group of partly confused Bav@@ arians in their audience @-@ block apparently provoked the supporters of host Pi@@ re@@ aus with words and gestures , the security forces attacked and went with head@@ aches against the Munich supporters . &quot;
at least one Bayern @-@ fan was injured out of the stadium .
&quot; who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth &quot;
&quot; who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lung , but also the teeth - this suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study . &quot;
&quot; the good news : when doing so , the risk is reduced rapidly . &quot;
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
&quot; this is the result of the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; compared to non @-@ smo@@ kers , the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely was higher in smo@@ kers to increase the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ Fa@@ che . &quot;
the scientists had observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
&quot; dental loss causes tooth decay and inflammation of the g@@ ums , emphasizes the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
&quot; for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors . &quot;
the connection between smoking and dental loss is therefore reduced to more frequent fl@@ ums of gum in smo@@ kers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of c@@ aries .
&quot; however , people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , it could take over ten years until the endanger@@ ing comes back to the level of non @-@ smoking , Er@@ du@@ tor Thomas Dietrich explained from the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; people should persu@@ ade people to be non @-@ smo@@ kers , &quot; said Manager H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking shor@@ tens life time . &quot;
&quot; smoking is good for lungs and vessels and , according to our findings , leads to good dental health even to high age . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 are affected by tooth@@ lessness , the DI@@ f@@ E shared . &quot;
previous studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early dental loss .
the new long @-@ term study rein@@ forces the findings .
archae@@ ologists meet the rem@@ nants of late Anti@@ quity at Cologne Rhein@@ u@@ fer
&quot; for the repeated time , archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne . &quot;
&quot; in the proximity of the construction site for the new Rhine Boulevard arch@@ e@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic museum have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said director Marcus Trier on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the construction works on the Rhine , historians have been searching for so @-@ called soil monuments . &quot;
&quot; for all construction projects in the district of Cologne , the museum is always recru@@ ited as a department for archaeological soil conservation . &quot;
&quot; in the third phase of the Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists have now found it . &quot;
&quot; from text documents it was already known that in the place in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century , a church stood , explained Trier . &quot;
&quot; in addition to rem@@ nants of the fortress and the church tower , there was also a cemetery with around 350 graves , which belonged to the church . &quot;
young woman captured by freight train
&quot; after a young woman is missing at the station in the street , the Federal Police asks the population for assistance . &quot;
&quot; on the early Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40 pm , the woman crossed the track towards the railway station building at the end of the platform and was seized by a freight train coming from M√∂n@@ chen@@ glad@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; due to the acquisition of the train , she suffered severe injuries by the Federal Police . &quot;
she was treated with emergency medical care and brought to a hospital by rescue forces .
&quot; on the basis of the night @-@ ni@@ gh@@ tly crossing of the young woman , the spar@@ ing officials have no knowledge . &quot;
the incident may possibly be observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic percep@@ tions .
&quot; local residents or pass@@ ers @-@ by from Lin@@ der@@ ner Bahn , Ziegel@@ bak@@ ehouse , Thom@@ as@@ hof@@ strasse and Lei@@ ff@@ ar@@ ther Stra√üe ( L@@ 3@@ 64 ) come into question . &quot;

European Commission propos@@ ing new court in dispute over TTIP
the European Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system to resolve the dispute over the planned Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Free Trade Agreement ( TTIP ) .
&quot; the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between companies and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its way of functioning corresponds to more traditional dishes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; said Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ str√∂m in charge of the performance . &quot;
the Swe@@ de intends to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the USA .
the German government announced support .
TTIP is to create the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely fores@@ ee that the EU states and the US will jointly choose independent judges for a new Investment Court .
&quot; they should come to equal parts from the EU , the US and third countries . &quot;
for the first time a second instance is provided .
it would allow it to appeal against jud@@ gements .
&quot; so far , the parties involved agreed among each other to arbitr@@ ators , there was no objection to their judgments . &quot;
&quot; in the discussion over the past few months , it became clear that citizens of the old IS@@ DS system did not trust in fair@@ ness and justice , said Malm@@ str√∂m . &quot;
&quot; in the long term , it aims to work according to its own data on an international investment court . &quot;
&quot; there , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could be clari@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration ( IS@@ DS ) , demanded mainly by large corporations , is regarded as one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP . &quot;
&quot; the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel judi@@ ci@@ ary , which companies can claim damages on tax@@ pa@@ yers , har@@ ass national laws or enforce a reduction of consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organisations like Camp@@ act described the proposals made by the European Commission as insufficient . &quot;
it was above all critici@@ zed that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
&quot; the German Minister for Economic Affairs , Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , however , described the plans as a great advance . &quot;
&quot; during the reform , the Commission considered essential points that Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sig@@ mar Gabriel worked with other EU trade ministers in the spring . &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als is from the table .
the French government also welcomed Malm@@ str√∂m &apos;s plans .
the European business association Business@@ Europe warned against restric@@ ting the economy &apos;s action by too many new rules .
&quot; in this way , particularly small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged . &quot;
&quot; when the talks on the TTIP free trade agreement ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , it remains unclear on Wednesday . &quot;
the negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
&quot; however , the topic of investor protection has not been discussed with the United States . &quot;
&quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot;
this date is considered to be no longer sustainable .
delicate folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
&quot; next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , where the in@@ timi@@ dating folk singer recorded the picturesque US state of Mich@@ igan with felt pen . &quot;
&quot; the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost moved by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture . &quot;
he tells the story of various places he always records on the map of what his meti@@ culous and delic@@ ately arranged songs report .
&quot; where they were born and what it looks like , in his homeland . &quot;
&quot; since then , St@@ ev@@ ens has proven to be a wonderfully creative Ir@@ rer . &quot;
&quot; with the third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan , &quot; published in 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan : the Great Lake State , &quot; clever@@ ly composed songs that blend harmon@@ i@@ ously with American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can drift into great opul@@ ent at any time . &quot;
&quot; the rum@@ or , &quot; Mich@@ igan , &quot; would be the first part of a dar@@ ing series : each of the 50 states of the US should be tri@@ mmed . &quot;
&quot; but already in 2004 and in the proximity of the Rhine , already &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; has already appeared and breaks positively certain expectations . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens will be reduced here .
live shows him guitar and ban@@ jo .
&quot; one year later , the musician , living in New York , returns to the series . &quot;
&quot; with &quot; Il@@ lin@@ ois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ite You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; ) , a nationwide celebrated masterpiece is released in 2005 . &quot;
over@@ flowing of ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board Charts and is not missing in any annual list of influential music media .
&quot; after extremely productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensively electronic distribution pieces . &quot;
&quot; this sixth record studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effects and rever@@ ber@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; for the smaller clubs , stage shows are shown here for the colorful spectacle of ne@@ on @-@ head@@ bands and large fluorescent stage de@@ co . &quot;
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a five @-@ member band .

&quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot;
&quot; although nearly 2,000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the clearly mature St@@ ev@@ ens returns to in@@ timacy and to folk . &quot;
&quot; without directing a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians is playing through the wide @-@ enriched album . &quot;
&quot; one hears from the audience : the lecture is &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; and one can actually throw away the &quot; &quot; plate &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; only to an en@@ core , St@@ ev@@ ens thank@@ ed himself , playing acousti@@ cally few older songs and finally bows down under thunder@@ ous applause . &quot;
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Ques@@ tion@@ n@@ aire
&quot; since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut is expected with tension at the prime minister &apos;s question@@ ings . &quot;
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is expected to give his debut at the prime minister &apos;s bid and for the first time he will be joining David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to ask the first of his six given questions shortly after lunch and his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MPs from close quarters .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave them to colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary scrut@@ iny for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent on Tuesday during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , has provoked criticism of a number of T@@ ory MPs and is at the centre of several front pages stories in the newspapers . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had been &quot; &quot; in respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s Shadow Cab@@ inet , O@@ wen Smith , told the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shadow @-@ ministers refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they refer to differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as a guide . &quot;
&quot; the political correspon@@ dent of BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also within Labour &quot; &quot; st@@ acks &quot; &quot; and indeed according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour MPs set forward to remove all the idea of a limitation .
&quot; hours later Mr Smith , the Shadow @-@ Labour and R@@ ent Minister , said that the party was &quot; &quot; very clear &quot; &quot; that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limitation of ¬£ 26@@ ,000 to ¬£ 23@@ ,000 . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron since he has been a T@@ ory boss over the last decade about the Dis@@ patch box in the Parliament .
&quot; the Labour leader , who promised another policy , says he has &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and given him more than 30.000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; Is@@ ling@@ ton North MP has said that the prime minister &apos;s question@@ ings are too confron@@ t@@ ative and that he will refrain from &quot; &quot; pun@@ ctu@@ ality &quot; &quot; and the dispute with bar@@ gaining and instead focus on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle will represent the shadow of economic ministers in him if he does not participate - for example if Mr Cameron is on his way abroad .
&quot; he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally took the word , and that he spoke to John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the House of House , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Ju@@ dy &amp; Ju@@ dy @-@ Theater . &quot; but a few years later he admitted that he failed . &quot;
&quot; since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the break with the Prime Minister was seen as the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the Unter@@ haus and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require far @-@ reaching reforms . &quot;

pound increases by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
&quot; the pound rose br@@ ittle to data showing an increase in the United Kingdom &apos;s wage growth . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the SA@@ B@@ Miller bid . &quot;
&quot; between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.@@ 9 % over the same period of the previous year . &quot;
&quot; since 2009 , this percentage has been the fastest and yiel@@ ded assessments of the time of interest increase . &quot;
&quot; the pound rose by more than 1 % over the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro to ‚Ç¨ 1.@@ 37@@ 30 . &quot;
&quot; the FT@@ SE 100 index ended with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 . &quot;
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after the takeover offer of the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v was received .
&quot; a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and combine brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot;
Bur@@ berry shares were higher after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont 0.@@ 9 % .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts &apos;s latest sales figures hit all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
&quot; Gl@@ en@@ core shares increased by 5 % , after the mining giant said that it took 2.5 billion dollars through a sale of stock as part of its debt reduction strategy . &quot;
&quot; the shares in the packaging and paper company Mon@@ di were the largest los@@ ers on the index , with a decrease of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his assessment for the company rating on &quot; sell . &quot; &quot;
&quot; J@@ D Sports rose by 3.1 % , after the Sports Agency had reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the first half of the year . &quot;
the boss of J@@ D Sports says higher wages end@@ anger expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
&quot; but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labor cost of his company , he says . &quot;
&quot; the cost could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and this could mean that there are less additional jobs . &quot;

&quot; currently , Mon@@ si@@ eur Bie@@ ber is in Berlin . &quot;
and the Generation U@@ 17 turns through .
like Wi@@ k@@ tori@@ a Ru@@ d@@ zin@@ ska .
&quot; the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name &quot; &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton &quot; . &quot; &quot;
not bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied J@@ ustin yesterday .
among them E@@ wa and Vik@@ tori@@ a from Poland .
&quot; however , since 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , the Pol@@ in sits on the cold stone plates of the Berlin luxury hotel on Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz . &quot;
&quot; the Bie@@ ber construction : here you live I@@ dol , whose posters hang on in St@@ et@@ tin , since Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; the suite , where the Canadian singer lives , costs exactly as much as her mo@@ m E@@ wa ear@@ ns in half a year . &quot;

&quot; that says , &quot; &quot; actually my Wi@@ k@@ tori@@ a would have to sit in the tenth class in the gymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; I am fulfilling her a dream . &quot;
compulsory education ?
who ju@@ gs it ?
the fans do not .
also Bie@@ ber himself does not .
he has already taken care of .
&quot; for the advertisement in the advertising break of the super@@ net he cas@@ es@@ ed three million , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ imp@@ le company fl@@ ushed many , many dollars to the Bie@@ ber account . &quot;
&quot; and with every doll that looks like it and goes over the counter , Bie@@ ber also cas@@ cades . &quot;
&quot; when J@@ ustin Bie@@ ber drinks a coffee , one is amazed at the window pane . &quot;
&quot; more than 100 million , it is said to have been so exploited . &quot;
some say the hyp@@ e is too far .
others emphasize that Bie@@ ber is finally in the US and UK with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; in place 1 .
&quot; Bie@@ ber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , are not interested in the many zer@@ os . &quot;
at least he does so .
Pe@@ gi@@ da poster brings Lebanese to the potato pat@@ rons &quot; idea
potatoes or D@@ √∂n@@ er ?
&quot; both - and in the potato @-@ cor@@ onation , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay has developed . &quot;
inspired by the slogan &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ √∂n@@ er &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da Movement Al@@ hay baked potatoes and meat together on a sk@@ ewer .
&quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; Pot@@ atoes , instead of D@@ √∂n@@ er , &quot; which he had acci@@ dentally seen on TV . &quot;
&quot; since then , there is a barbecue sk@@ ewer in his shop , which is equipped with meat and potatoes . &quot;
&quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay . &quot;
the idea has now been made to the Lebanese by the Patent Office in Munich .
&quot; according to the authorities , it has recently been protected as a utility model . &quot;
&quot; how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains , Al@@ hay does not want to give away . &quot;
&quot; only so much : &quot; it tastes even better , &quot; he finds . &quot;
culinary understanding also comes along with its customers .
Met@@ cash starts campaign for comb@@ ating Al@@ di@@ - Inv@@ itation
Met@@ cash tries to protect the I@@ GA branches off an Al@@ di @-@ rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a campaign campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run @-@ up to a $ 700 million Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; while Al@@ di prepares the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia in early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show . &quot;
&quot; Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers are jumping on board , with brands such as ice manufacturer S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples and store owners to sell approved tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish further details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment performs its annual investor strategy day . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot in the game , as South Australia and Western Australia make up almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA retail shops and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA networks in the eastern states . &quot;
&quot; purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia in comparison to around 14 percent in eastern states . &quot;
analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will cut around five percent of the food market in these two states twelve months after opening its first markets and will take away all existing players but mainly independent retailers .
&quot; according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailers could lose $ 360 million in revenues per year and meter $ 250 million by the end of 2016 . &quot;
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA in the next year and will generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
&quot; the loss in food and food business and met@@ c@@ ash@@ s of high fixed costs could cost around 13 million $ profit before interest and tax , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Met@@ cash will lose market share in eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most tre@@ ach@@ erous . &quot;
&quot; Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s sales in the food and food business will fall by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; last week , the leading F@@ ond@@ s@@ manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told Melbourne that Met@@ cash is likely to disappear within a decade . &quot;
Met@@ cash refused to publicly respond to the comment by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member is contacted by Met@@ cash with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
&quot; the market share has declined from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trade , which supplies about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the operational debt reduction in terms of turnover and margins . &quot;
&quot; however , the wholes@@ aler is resist@@ ing and investing more than $ 150 million in order to equ@@ alize sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths for hundreds of products every week and to improve their stores by fast growing fresh food and providing a better selection of private label food . &quot;
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s chief executive manager Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and re@@ charging programs to El@@ an are going to grow and hopes that the wholes@@ aler in 2017 will return to a profit growth for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise as a cri@@ tique of his behaviour .
&quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick C@@ yrene , and according to the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly deserves praise as criticism for his own behaviour . &quot;
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ os , who is repeatedly called &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; got into the spotlight with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters . &quot;
&quot; soon after that , in a fi@@ ery qualification game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be sever@@ ed twice by the refer@@ ee , where Har@@ rison exc@@ laimed : &quot; &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have to hit Kyr@@ Geor@@ gios , and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was last seen as he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cr@@ amp th@@ war@@ ted a potential US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth around the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Great Britain . &quot;
&quot; one thing I &apos;m quite ri@@ cher about is the fact that , according to my opinion , Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn a bit into the dispute , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost in the US Open because of a cr@@ amp , but he is not the first player who broke a bat of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on and I think he deserves a lot of recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around himself , he has a great family around himself , and I think he was treated a little too stern . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also decided not to take into account the decision to take C@@ yrene before the important preliminary decision , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return a long @-@ term fixed part into the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not all around the controversi@@ es &#91; Kyr@@ g@@ gio &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; he rises in the eyes of the public , and he has made some aw@@ ful mistakes and deserves all the criticism that he gets , but we try to give him the consequences of his actions . I think it is best for the team and it is best for the team and it is the best for him . &quot;
&quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary explains emergency status , closes the border , keeps refugees back &quot;
Hungary explains the state of emergency and regulated the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and detained all who tried to come illeg@@ ally in the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos ensu@@ ed at the border when hundreds of migrants lost themselves in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and Ser@@ b officials responded with indignation .
&quot; the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a land strip on the road between the two check@@ points of the countries , and built tents and settled there . &quot;
but frustr@@ ations rose .
&quot; when a police helicopter was ho@@ vering over them , the migrants &quot; open the border &quot; and cried out insul@@ ts against the Hungarian army police . &quot;
some were returned from protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister declared it &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be returned , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; there must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border reached a day after the 28 @-@ year bloc in a controversial meeting in Brussels that no common immigration policy could be made .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who were seeking refuge in the shr@@ unken Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that after the next month or by the end of the year an agreement would be reached that the EU states would receive more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; Hungary , however , did not impose its hopes on a soon @-@ going action of Brussels or its neighbors . &quot;
&quot; the emergency shelter killed on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could block roads and accelerate asylum procedures . &quot;
&quot; the Hungarian Foreign Minister , Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to , said that his country plans to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country - having ended a fence at the Serbian border . &quot;
&quot; C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates were employed in the race , bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and an entry point to the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most of the coming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who claim protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws , which entered into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ metre ( 13 feet ) high fence that the government built along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares the state of emergency , &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still agree on the deployment of the military that is expected next week , but re@@ porters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people tried to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated deeper into the country . &quot;
&quot; they come across by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of comm@@ itting criminal off@@ ences according to the new laws . &quot;
authorities are trying to fix the fence quickly .
Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning also two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia following a train wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
&quot; chaos surrounded the main border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to deal with the data of people and press a crowd to go into it . &quot;
&quot; about 20 managed to enter , but thousands remained outside . &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the main motorway link between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they travel to Hungary .
election 2016 : hal@@ ved H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey
&quot; former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit margin in the democratic race for the nom@@ ination at the national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her face to the ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent earlier ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; vice @-@ Chairman Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is a candidate for the presidential office , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the beginning of the elections , most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion determines which candidate they will support . &quot;
but Clinton supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS News Survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders posted some gains . &quot;
&quot; Clinton holds a major lead in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have decreased . &quot;
&quot; your support for the men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders back here only with 5 points . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s advantage in democratic voters under the age of 50 has evap@@ or@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , however , still has a major advantage in older voters . &quot;
&quot; last month , Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit margin in the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot;
about half of the democratic elec@@ torate of the local elections say they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
&quot; a quarter would support them with some reservations , and another 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate . &quot;
six percent would not support them .
perhaps it is not surprising that Clin@@ tons &apos;s current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about it .
the views are more mixed with those who are not currently supporting Clinton - only about a quarter would support them enthusi@@ astically .
&quot; while 48 percent of the democratic voters in the elections say they support Clinton with enthusiasm , fewer Republi@@ can voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; if Clinton supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that they have the correct experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
permission to deal with the problems and the voting rights are also quoted .
&quot; as the vice @-@ president th@@ rows a potential for the presidential office , 57 percent of the democratic voters of the pre @-@ elections would like to see him in the race - although one third believes that he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic elec@@ tors of the pre @-@ elections are asked , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the helm . &quot;
&quot; from Clin@@ tons &apos;s followers more than half , Bi@@ den would be their second choice far from S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; if Bi@@ den decides not to channel for the nom@@ ination of the democr@@ ats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead before S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in the race is increased to 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; fifty @-@ five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best opportunities to win the election , but this figure has fallen from 78 percent in the last month . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; has risen . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic voters say questions about the voters . &quot;
&quot; similar to the last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these elec@@ torate of the pre @-@ elections proves to be unacceptable . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidates or potential candidates perform good results in some important features among voters in the pre @-@ election of their party . &quot;
&quot; maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; with the three candidates Bi@@ den is best in hon@@ esty , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead . &quot;
&quot; thirty percent of democratic voters don &apos;t believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say it about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not think of him . &quot;
&quot; democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ideological in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; in all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server are continued as foreign minister during the term as foreign minister , most of the Democratic voters of the pre @-@ elections are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say it has not influenced their opinions altogether . &quot;
but it is a different story in the American public altogether .
&quot; half of Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no impact on their general opinion from Clinton , although 36 percent said their opinion has deterior@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six out of 10 who say their views are worse by Clinton . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is viewed by the voters of their party as honest and trust@@ worthy , this is still a problem for them among registered voters in total : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 percent of the eligible holders do not consider it an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
&quot; at the same time , 55 percent of those entitled to vote in the country also see Tru@@ mp as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; Clinton and Tru@@ mp , however , receive good marks on tour . &quot;
&quot; from the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best cut hon@@ esty . &quot;
&quot; a majority regards S@@ anders rather than honestly , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him . &quot;
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections amounts to 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son draws near Donald Tru@@ mp in the nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is at the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times close behind Donald Tru@@ mp
&quot; in the meantime , half of the voters &apos; support in the new survey falls on both candidates and others lose a lot of support . &quot;
&quot; Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tru@@ mp in large numbers nationwide . the support is growing from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News Deb@@ ate last month , 27 % in the vote on Tuesday . &quot;
but Car@@ son fell from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son arrives well in demographic groups and sur@@ passes tru@@ mp among Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio governor , John Ka@@ sich , is kno@@ cked down with Wis@@ cons@@ ins governor Scott Walker , who has fallen down at the lowest level , with 10 % support last month to now 2 % . &quot;
&quot; former Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Senator Marco Ru@@ bio , are in third place with 6 % . &quot;
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or minus 6 % and was conducted in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey published last week shows that Car@@ son goes up in the p@@ olls - he ends up with 19 % support for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support . &quot;
the recent survey by ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tru@@ mp clearly ahead of Car@@ son .
&quot; looking at a Car@@ son ascending last week , Tru@@ mp took some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question tru@@ mp &apos;s faith . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; Tru@@ mp said last Saturday during a campaign in I@@ owa . &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; even if peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers to find even warm water . &quot;
a bathroom in the north or the Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; some people do not go to the sea anymore : at a maximum of 18 degrees , the water in the North Sea and Baltic Sea in this week shares the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) . &quot;
&quot; bathing temperatures , on the other hand , continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the East , it even reaches up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic it is 25 degrees in top , in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Bar@@ uch College newcom@@ ers
&quot; almost two years after a student died at a student compound in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , a student was lod@@ ged against five persons . &quot;
&quot; members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g brut@@ ally and delayed his transportation to the hospital , which contributed to his death , shared the police . &quot;
&quot; officials said he had been loaded with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to cross a frozen field to a destination . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about head@@ aches , then he fell unconscious . &quot;
&quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 , after den@@ ies became impot@@ ent and allegedly waited for an hour before they brought it to a hospital so the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , to goo@@ gle his symptoms and to contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood , to seek advice , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members began to hide utensils and basically set the welfare of the Brotherhood about that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; said police chief Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and the next morning he died of his injuries . &quot;
&quot; after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly added with bl@@ unt force injuries to head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs . &quot;
&quot; many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies at the ch@@ ic@@ anes since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s family in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held ac@@ countable , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended an indictment for murder of the third rank for the first five members .
&quot; thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of persecution and formation of a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t just want to blame the people involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or in@@ officially - sanc@@ tioned this , we will also hold this to account , &quot; &quot; said Wagner on a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national br@@ otherhood has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation to the local group . &quot;
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; an increase in interest is coming , and the house@@ keeping will drop down , returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession . &quot;
we know this .
what we do not know how long it will last and how long it will stop .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy offers only small instructions on how to proceed . &quot;
a recession came within 11 months after the first rise of interest and lasted 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ siv@@ ity of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often , though not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments react . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the US central bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather to the period required for normal@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; in the end , however , market participants could find that all the excitement was possibly exagger@@ ated because of an increase in interest . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of cheap money , &quot; &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to the sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no impact . &quot;
here is a look at historic trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
&quot; as the market saw last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things volati@@ le for a while . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the increase arrives , the impact is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there seems to be a tendency that net income returns 12 to 24 months after the first up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment , which might reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happened after the interest rate of the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; in more detail , the market is mostly upward trend in the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to interest increase , rather flat in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , according to a current analysis , published by Bob Dol@@ l , Head of plant strate@@ gi@@ sts at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the raising cycle and the return on which begins to decrease .
&quot; rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote it . &quot;
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that did not exist before and which could accelerate a recession . &quot;
it is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point at an interest rate of the F@@ ed .
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest increases since 1950 had only twice the nominal GDP of under 4.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the Atlanta foundation . &quot;
&quot; interest increases in such a fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and raise the question of &quot; &quot; whether this time is different , &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; market participants posted the whole year on an interest increase in the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trade is only a 25 percent probability . &quot;
&quot; in our study , all the raising cycles from 1950 to the present day have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ed heights very quickly after the start of recovery . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months so far . &quot;
&quot; fixed income was also volati@@ le , as the market anticip@@ ates interest increase , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market . &quot;
the main difference is that the effect in bonds is faster than when equi@@ ties change if they change their strategic direction .
&quot; for loans , the returns appear to change direction once the first increase / decrease is done in the cycle . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the raising cycle , the loans fall immediately , said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to a closer link between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
&quot; highly @-@ interest bonds often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed @-@ Strategy expectations . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest rates have increased , the yield curve is flat , lending tension has wi@@ dened and volati@@ lity has increased - all the features of the market , if the F@@ ed intensi@@ fies its strategy . &quot;
companies that handle the larger part of their business operations in the United States will benefit from it when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
&quot; multinational companies with high debts will be worse , as a growing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also the financing of their debts . &quot;
&quot; history shows that &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; shares tend to react very positively three months after an initial interest increase , &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot;
&quot; companies with a strong balance sheet have exceeded the average by 5 percentage points after each of the interest increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 . &quot;
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt will be a big problem .
&quot; companies with a high share of flexible interest rates are most likely to lose , said Gold@@ man . &quot;
&quot; outside the pure share games , consumers will also benefit from the growing dollar . &quot;
&quot; savers could see profits by higher yields , even if experts from different opinions are how fast that will take place . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says Par@@ liam@@ entary Member Andrew B@@ ingham &quot;
the conserv@@ atives member of the parliament critici@@ zed the station because of its &quot; stup@@ idity &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not to be distinguished from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also quoted the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins resor@@ ted to the show The Voice and said that this was not very original .
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns to Classic FM , &quot; says a leading member of the Parliament and raises new pressure on the channel to prove that he does something that the private sen@@ ders do not do . &quot;
&quot; the Conserv@@ ative MEP Andrew B@@ ingham also said to the BBC @-@ bos@@ ses that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
he also quoted the BBC Music Awards that launched last December .
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , appear to be The Br@@ its just under a different name . &quot;
&quot; so if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples where you can only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said . &quot;
BBC @-@ General Director rejected the alleg@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 went far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
&quot; what I &apos;m learning from Radio 3 , I &apos;ll never learn about classical music anywhere else . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and playing music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and commission new works , I think too important , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that he had to work harder to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British were less informed about classical music . &quot;
&quot; however , Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which was under fire during the hearing in the committee on the selection of culture , media and sport for it , the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins resor@@ ted to The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was bought by the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for estimated cost of ‚Ç¨ 22 million . &quot;
&quot; do you see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not particularly striking ? &quot;
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as Ju@@ dge - was produced in a special BBC mode .
&quot; he added , he would like the company &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; when it comes to an entertainment series next time . &quot;
&quot; however , he refused to exclude the order from other series of The Voice in the future or to spend money from fee bills for other entertainment formats . &quot;
net sales increased in August and Black Friday can be responsible for it
&quot; in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales . &quot;
&quot; in the last month , there was the lowest score since the beginning of records in 2000 . &quot;
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones to buy
experts believe Black Friday in November has slow@@ ed down expenses
&quot; for over a decade , virtual shopping has bo@@ oted , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost@@ ly cities . &quot;
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures only show seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures only show seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you consider the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , that has always been developed over time , &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G @-@ sales journal of the Guardian . &quot;
&quot; he explained that online sales increased three years ago , when buyers started to make purchases with their mobile purchases . &quot;
&quot; it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do so in different environments , for example at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now that &apos;s going on , and we may experience that growth will decrease . &quot;
the Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for declining sales .
&quot; experts believe that buyers will hold back their purchases before this event , which takes place on the last Friday of November . &quot;
&quot; last year , five times the average number of buyers around their computers jumped to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer sites crashed . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , where the buyers fought for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases . &quot;
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that ¬£ 5 had spent a little more than 1 ¬£ online .
&quot; in some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one @-@ third of purchases are now done via web shops . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities . &quot;
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca at the crane accident killed - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the corp@@ ses of 29 dead are borne by Muslims at the first burial in Mec@@ ca through the streets
Saudi Arabia partly bur@@ sts the collapse of the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group
&quot; the Ministry of Health said that in addition , a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane crashed . &quot;
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the dead who were killed when a crane crashed at Mek@@ ka &apos;s big lake .
&quot; mour@@ ning filled , mostly dressed in white , the track to pay their respect , when the first of the dead came to the Al @-@ Mo@@ eh@@ em cemetery . &quot;
&quot; the funeral procession passed by the Holy Place , where only days before a building crane fell by the ceiling of the mosque and then fell on the beds . &quot;
&quot; the corp@@ ses were released for the funeral , when the Saudi king over the construction company of Bin Laden caused a disaster , which also left 3@@ 94 injured . &quot;
&quot; the corp@@ ses of 29 people killed , when a crane was r@@ ushed by the Great Central mosque of Mec@@ ca , were carried through the streets . &quot;
&quot; among the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , was father of four children who had been on his first pilgrimage when the crane was under@@ scor@@ ing . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ ess Mos@@ que in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already stated that the H@@ add@@ lers will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands who continue to come to the city .
&quot; today , King Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden Group , would not have to steal the arm of the crane than he was not used . &quot;
an Arabic version of the decree issued by the State Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
&quot; the English @-@ language service of the news agency did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company abroad was prohibited . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man promised to reveal what caused the down@@ fall of the crane , who r@@ ushed into an inner courtyard of the large mosque , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims in front of the p@@ add@@ ess , who later took place this month , were gathered . &quot;
&quot; the Bin Laden Group has not published any statements about the collapse of the crane , and their representatives were not available for a statement . &quot;
the Royal Dec@@ ree also imp@@ acted the group because of not current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surrounded Mek@@ ka &apos;s big mosque as part of the massive construction led by the Bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden family has been connected to the Saudi Arabia family for decades and takes over major construction projects .
&quot; the late leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was an apost@@ ate son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 @-@ s . &quot;
&quot; the crash of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims . &quot;
officials said that 158 people stay in the hospital .
&quot; government representatives ordered that 1 million Ri@@ al ( ¬£ 17@@ 4,000 ) to be paid to the members of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured . &quot;
other verb@@ s receive half of this amount .

&quot; it is claimed that Britain lay down its h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified East European tra@@ des@@ men , who carry out the work in their home . &quot;
&quot; if you can deal skil@@ fully with a hammer or a brush for painting walls , you seem to be a minority nowadays . &quot;
&quot; the British are increasingly employing craftsmen to carry home worker jobs in their homes , so the boss of the company behind B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; V√©@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new Managing Director of King@@ f@@ isher who owns the DIY chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled arti@@ sans from Eastern Europe , who offer services to low prices , have now been ob@@ sol@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , King@@ f@@ isher plans to open 200 new Scre@@ w@@ ready Shops that focus on arti@@ sans and close 60 outlets from B &amp; Q . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops because eight out of ten purchase decisions in the store are made by women .
&quot; at the moment , the men out@@ weigh the men . &quot;
&quot; she said it was necessary to meet the growing demographic trends that show more female single households , which make up more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; there is still a majority of men in our branches .
we have to shift this to a balance .
&quot; as a matter of principle , half of our clients consist of women with 80 per cent of the decisions regarding the purchase of articles by women . &quot;
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the head of a British company in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 index , has also re@@ structured her top team to reflect the same number of men and women in executive positions . &quot;
King@@ F@@ isher is the only company that has occupied precisely 50 percent of the team with women including its management and Chief Financial Officer .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic .
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
King@@ F@@ isher reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and turnover after the Group bl@@ amed the cost of closing the shops .
&quot; because of the trends , King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches . &quot;
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ ob because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday two officials of the Austrian volleyball vice @-@ runner A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and par@@ ity .
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them had also been accused of ab@@ uses .
&quot; from this alleg@@ ation , he was acqu@@ itted in force in May . &quot;
the current trial was postpon@@ ed .
&quot; according to the prosec@@ utor , Robert Ri@@ ffel , in the preliminary investigation , cryst@@ alli@@ zed that the accused were used for private purposes in the years 2006 to 2011 . &quot;
&quot; he har@@ nesses the damage at around 400@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the sports officials are also accused of financial loss .
&quot; this fact was the chairman of the Sch@@ √∂ff@@ ler Senate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it shall be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; for the off@@ ence of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence represented that the association did not come into existence at any time . &quot;
&quot; the sports function@@ aries would have calculated only expense compens@@ ations and the sports club , for which they had spent a lot of time and money in which they had invested a lot of time and money - the liabilities amounted to around 600@@ ,000 sh@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; at that time , we stood before the situation : do we carry on or ban the club ? &quot; &quot; told one of the defend@@ ants , in the bread @-@ profession of large @-@ scale audi@@ tors of the financial officer . &quot;
&quot; with his colleague and co @-@ defend@@ ant , he decided to take over this task . &quot;
with all risks .
&quot; we threw out money , put our life insurance policies as security at the bench , &quot; &quot; he said at the time of receipt . &quot;
&quot; the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , it is not allowed to make any debts . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in case of corresponding financial success , the payment of expense compens@@ ations had been decided retro@@ spec@@ tively until 1991 . &quot;
&quot; therefore one part of the allowance was paid only years later , namely from the year 2003 , when a plus had been on the account . &quot;
&quot; therefore , package and non @-@ detailed accounts seemed to appear , the former chairman explained the events . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and savings books jointly administered the two defend@@ ants , the second defend@@ ant said . &quot;
&quot; why the withdrawal of the association was not disclosed in detail , the judge asked . &quot;
&quot; the association did not care in detail for the financial deposit , it was only important to have the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account against the one functional investigation . &quot;
&quot; these were set@@ backs , the defend@@ ants declared . &quot;
&quot; this securities account ran on the name of the second defend@@ ant , and was not known to the association according to his statement . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot;
the respon@@ dent did not know how to answer for a long time .
&quot; then he finally thought , he believed that this was the best for the association . &quot;
&quot; if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor placed in the room . &quot;
&quot; the defend@@ ant was informed , the function@@ ary justified himself . &quot;
&quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; claim res@@ titu@@ tion &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; why indem@@ n@@ ity ? , judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know . &quot;
the first defend@@ ant stated that he did not agree with this formulation because the association never had any damage .
&quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; With this you are all from the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a lawyer ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; the function@@ ary said he never got a c@@ ents salary , he only calcul@@ ates mil@@ eage and di@@ eting . &quot;
&quot; he charged EUR 1,000 per month to the association , but the actual effort was much higher , he added . &quot;
the defend@@ ants were not able to provide accurate records for the early years .
&quot; these were no longer kept after an audit in which everything was judged correctly , they declared . &quot;
mil@@ eage allowance was also covered by the second defend@@ ant .
&quot; all the shifts take place in cash , and he said he had to drive from his place of residence to the Bank to Blei@@ burg , he explained in his statement . &quot;
the trial will continue on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard reaches another 30.000 jobs
&quot; in addition to personnel cuts running for three years , Compu@@ terri@@ ese will continue to disman@@ tle further jobs when spl@@ itting the company . &quot;
the positions at the US computer terri@@ fic H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) find no end .
&quot; as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to reduce the breakdown of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer segment . &quot;
&quot; as a result , costs tot@@ alling EUR 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) are to be saved on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the step will lead to a special load of around ‚Ç¨ 2.7 billion , which will drop in the fourth quarter . &quot;
&quot; the reduction of 5@@ 5,000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years . &quot;
&quot; at the end of fiscal 2013 / 14 , HP employed some 30@@ 2,000 associates . &quot;
&quot; in the after@@ market , the H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard stock was 2.3 percent . &quot;
&quot; the company , which has grown up with printers from the Califor@@ nian Pal@@ o Alto , is currently spl@@ itting up : this is how the computer and printer business is to be bund@@ led in a new society - separate from the more promising areas with computer servers and data store for companies as well as other services . &quot;
both business units are to be listed on the stock exchange .
a again dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales and a weaker customer demand for its services set the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer to the latest Lenovo .
&quot; in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , sales of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent . &quot;
sales fell by 8 percent to almost 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
&quot; in this way , the proceeds went back to 15 of 16 quarters . &quot;
HP responds with a spl@@ itting up and massive sub@@ missions on the changes in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has not until late re@@ acted that customers can buy more smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and get more and more shops online .
&quot; in total Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plan fores@@ ees the reduction of around 55@@ ,000 jobs . &quot;
conflict : majority supports anti @-@ IS training mission
&quot; a direct involvement of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would , however , largely be rejected : 54 per cent said , 35 percent showed themselves in agreement . &quot;
the fact that other states fly air strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria is 61 percent positive .
24 percent are opposed to interven@@ ing in the conflict .
&quot; in collaboration with Syrian leaders Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , 51 percent of those surv@@ eyed were up to 20 percent . &quot;
29 per cent could not decide .
car : second day of the press at the 6@@ 6th IAA
&quot; the focus of the fair will be on the 27th of September , connected , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars and e @-@ mobility . &quot;
&quot; after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Automobile Exhibition under the motto &quot; Mobility . &quot; &quot;
the wide public can visit the IAA from Saturday .
&quot; the organisers of the V@@ DA car association expect approximately 900 000 visitors two years ago . &quot;
R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke : demo@@ li@@ tion of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police took on the Serbian border at R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ √§n@@ eng@@ as and water@@ shed against several hundred infl@@ ated refugees .
the Euron@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ √°@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the out@@ burst of violence at the border control point .
he reported by phone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
&quot; after that , a police line had formed and behind the polic@@ emen there was a wat@@ cher . &quot;
&quot; 40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to officials . &quot;
the officials first started pe@@ pper@@ y spray .
&quot; after that , the police used tear gas . &quot;
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now waited a little bit withdrawn .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone .
&quot; children , who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas , cried . &quot;
&quot; other refugees gathered in themselves , suffering from short@@ ness of breath . &quot;
the press spokes@@ men of the Serbian police also suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US bank@@ note bank
&quot; the world is watching when the US st@@ aves are coming together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether interest rates have been raised for the first time or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey among 80 econom@@ ists questioned by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half , the last week of the view , that the F@@ ed will do so , now think that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and the interest rates at the current level will be from 0 to 0.@@ 25 percent . &quot;
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed Inter@@ est placed interest on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time we approach a situation in which a large central bank could possibly leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , Managing Director at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the US economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ros@@ y outlook on global circumstances . &quot;
&quot; it has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs point out that the chances of such a step are good . &quot;
the decision is to be announced at 20@@ .00 CE@@ T on Thursday
death schu@@ h@@ ler at the Delta State University left ap@@ ologies
&quot; after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later shot and killed his colleagues on the day , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; in the first murder and wanted &quot; &quot; he could do it wrong &quot; , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lecturer for ge@@ ography and social science education at Delta State University , called emergency number at 10 : 00 am Monday morning &quot;
&quot; and he said , He has shot on someone and killed a man . &quot;
Lamb said to the staff of the emergency call centre that police must send polic@@ emen to his home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; swe@@ eter dog &quot; is in the house , but nobody will distur@@ b &quot; nobody , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the c@@ aller for his name , but he did not give it . &quot;
Lamb did not give any explanation for his shots .
&quot; when police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , said : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry I wanted , I could reverse it . &quot;
&quot; I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
&quot; after writing the note , Lamb travelled to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he eventually killed his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen killed him . &quot;
&quot; President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ b &apos;s performance . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday that Lamb believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said that they were married about seven years , as a &quot; good man . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss would have a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; destroyed &quot; &quot; on the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss were her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; said Know@@ les &quot;
&quot; the police said , &quot; &quot; Lamb called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; he did not go to prison . &quot;
&quot; as polic@@ emen caught him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb ran his car to the side , fled by foot , ran into the forest and killed herself with a shot . &quot;
Lamb received a Ph@@ .@@ D. in Spring 2015 from the Delta State University as his way of life on the university &apos;s website .
stars who have lost their lucky charm
&quot; the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years . &quot;
&quot; in 2001 , he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long@@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , for cancer . &quot;
&quot; the actor allegedly participated in drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug possession . &quot;
all this surely demands his tribute .
Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa is expanding the group
the Lufthansa plan is planning a large group restructuring .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organization .
&quot; 150 of the around 1,000 executives around the world will cost the work of the Group . &quot;
&quot; with the pilot &apos;s union , however , there are new negotiations . &quot;
the Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the low @-@ cost Eu@@ row@@ ings .
&quot; the aim of the real@@ ignment was to generate an earnings contribution of around ‚Ç¨ 500 million per year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , the airline issued on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; among other things , Lufthansa will no longer be a member of the passenger business in the future . &quot;
the cheap airline Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independent as possible .
Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings in the management team headed by Chef Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r .
&quot; with the new order , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future . &quot;
&quot; so far , the organization of the 120 000 employee has been a complex company . &quot;
&quot; the airlines operate under the roof of the Passage Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros . &quot;
new negotiations with the pilots
&quot; in the collective conflict with the cockpit association cockpit ( VC ) , the negotiations after the strike will be resum@@ ed on this Thursday . &quot;
that divided the union .
the topic of talks should be the retirement scheme for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in one year , the cockpit &quot; &quot; wants to achieve sustainable results as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between the union and the airline led to various strikes in recent months .
&quot; in addition to the transitional provision of the pilots , the background is the &quot; Wings &quot; austerity concept . &quot;
it seems that Lufthansa in the fight against competitors stretches over to the group &apos;s own fine line Eu@@ row@@ ings .

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double frac@@ ture
&quot; in the Champions League defeat of Manchester , Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven . &quot;
&quot; while this brought the left foreign distributor to cry and will exclude him for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ √©@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year old Sha@@ w had collap@@ sed into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the playing field and needed oxygen before he was brought to hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double bond and is in the hospital . &quot;
he will be transferred tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester .
&quot; it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it has very hard and then plays fantastic , and then it happens . &quot;
in the dressing room he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
&quot; I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then the six months , and he will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the hanging of an el@@ m .
&quot; Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , did not punish the Mexican . &quot;
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian arbit@@ er had been mistaken .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card are due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; a tweet based on Sha@@ ws account said : &quot; &quot; thank you all for your messages . words can &apos;t describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I &apos;ll be back more strongly . &quot;
related to this : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in defeat at PS@@ V
&quot; with the European Championship in France , the UK distributor has an additional incentive to recover until the coming June . &quot;
&quot; Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a very serious injury . &quot;
&quot; when a player leaves the place with this type of injury , all are very sad about it . &quot;
it is never the intention of our players to hurt a opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ al Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you then hear it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball that was in a different direction , so it looked like he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be . &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ √©s Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to the hospital after a b@@ oul@@ der by Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t take long before you know it almost by heart . &quot;
unless you are David Cameron .
&quot; when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , the environmental f@@ law published in 1971 , decided by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book I like to read to my children , because it always seems to give an image or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
&quot; everything nice and good , except that the subsequent paragraph , in which Cameron allegedly describes the plot of the book , instead re@@ produces an ingredient of the 2012 movie version , adding new characters and details to extend the rather short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; as if that wasn &apos;t enough : the text presented by Cameron is partly reading like the summary of the lau@@ ax film presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and so begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where everything is arti@@ fici@@ ally and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he ad@@ mits to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems impro@@ b@@ able that Cameron is so little familiar with the story of the book . here , an un@@ named boy hears , like the local environment by the gre@@ edy , trees for@@ lor@@ ding , Th@@ ought frustr@@ ating being that speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row . &quot;
a Down@@ ing Street spokesperson said that the text had probably come from Camer@@ ons &apos;s electoral district .
&quot; Super@@ camp confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff , but there were no other immediate comments . &quot;
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened with the exclusion from England &apos;s team but it is still difficult
&quot; to hit Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if one sees the cad@@ re that England has chosen for the tour , a repetition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card . &quot;
I would not exclude a forward victory .
&quot; A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks page is perhaps less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars of 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali develops as a spin @-@ punch and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown quantity at test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
&quot; related news : Adam Ly@@ th reti@@ res from the UK @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der , and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales . &quot;
&quot; the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , difficult to analyze for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire . &quot;
&quot; in his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that Cri@@ cket players are focused on results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark with Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , da - and I said this before - players are their own best selection . &quot;
&quot; a long time ago , the barrel of Ly@@ th could have been extended , but he had control of his own fate . &quot;
&quot; if he hopefully turns out further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes . &quot;
&quot; the UK @-@ trainer Tre@@ vor Ba@@ yl@@ iss praised his attitude , even if he did not produce such good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man . &quot;
the question of how much time a test impact man receives to set his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and forward play .
&quot; the only accus@@ ation that can be raised was that England first deployed Jonathan in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form , but this lost opportunity now lies in the past . &quot;
Alex H@@ ales comes in and he is a drummer I treasure .
&quot; he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge place , which hit us very much . &quot;
&quot; he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this depends on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to make mos@@ ques next to Cook , which would provide an extra spin punch and get four Qui@@ cks , aw@@ akes and I have nothing against it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a drummer cannot hit there , and this left @-@ handed player has already shown that he is a Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ er@@ l of Cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; mos@@ ques may not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is number 3 for them , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my former team @-@ mate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first drop before he joined the op@@ ener in 2001 .
he made three hundred ra@@ gs straight away and did not look back .
&quot; Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ re as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited deal@@ ings with him he has impressed me as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may see their statistics on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup spi@@ ders that raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England has made some clever additions to the trainer &apos;s staff . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ dene , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game , who will bring a wealth of experiences as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood arrives for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful commitment into the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh air in the changing cabin , even if the messages are in line with what has been said before . &quot;
&quot; Tony &apos;s team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used for the One @-@ Da@@ yers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but coaches and team performers do not determine the schedule . &quot;

Bre@@ x@@ it camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = Britain &apos;s exit from the EU ) could gain access if the economy runs into a f@@ lau@@ te by 2017
&quot; David Cameron &apos;s un@@ declared res@@ ent@@ ative strategy to keep Britain in the EU gets deeper into trouble with every day , even without the choice of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; &quot;
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ at friend recently said that some member states , so deeply mired in various crises , like the EU now is and not always satisfied by their own debt , Britain &apos;s own agenda with split concessions and disturbing treaty changes that they mostly do not want to be satisfied . &quot;
&quot; in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided on its annual meeting that it does not like it if it je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zes social protection . &quot;
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie &apos;s agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and finance ministers climb on summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they win allies for reforms . &quot;
it is always about me .
&quot; my European friend who wishes a UK outside the EU tent - &quot; L@@ ass us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where they don &apos;t care whether we stay or go . &quot;
&quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as did T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
French President Fran√ßois Hollande has a look at his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
he is also a f@@ ading force .
&quot; Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left one . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to imagine that they will break a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie Br@@ its , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s withdrawal from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot;
&quot; therefore some such ministers may even intentionally not plan helpful comments , quite in SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my friend susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankrupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Britain has gained nothing of value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
Europeans know how predat@@ ory Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one as they did during the referendum held by Tony Ben@@ n in 1975 but did not support our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; they can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro opport@@ uni@@ sts who made a name as an &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90@@ s . &quot;
&quot; with all his ins@@ anity , Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were . &quot;
&quot; this included the med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing villa@@ ins , telephone exchanges and the pseudo @-@ non @-@ countries , most of our large newspapers . &quot;
&quot; Tony Bla@@ ir actually thought about them similar to them , but determined that when sitting with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , one gets better ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of going to his lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ i@@ ri@@ ans than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had set the principle of the non @-@ adopted constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 . &quot;
the press has never forgiven him .
&quot; but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly rap@@ port on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he didn &apos;t need time for me - seems to be in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck Bo@@ y@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 @-@ th years , a mistake back then and today . &quot;
&quot; it can take , but it must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sof@@ as he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position on Europe - I feel friendly - in development .
he says we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; well , most people outside U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional bl@@ ond pul@@ p tendency and the wild followers of Tor@@ ey &apos;s Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ev@@ ism may well say Yes . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; Ein Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television this week , when the boy@@ sc@@ outs fought in him , did not admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the pro@@ voc@@ ative John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell as a shadow law was a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father tried to be il@@ loyal to his cabinet colleagues , without going too far and losing his cabinet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports on their cl@@ auses on Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a ne@@ sting place of par@@ ano@@ ia and treas@@ on . &quot;
&quot; it is right to give Cameron no free map for Europe , which allows him to hold our support in the communications campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks so .
&quot; but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities for EU membership - in line with its Benn@@ ite siege economy , its anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of small differences is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities for Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not campaign for exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try , in all , to find a sense of their superi@@ ors at home . &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they too have di@@ stru@@ st@@ ful voters - to make concessions to the British if all this can be meaning@@ less ?
&quot; the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government in power , what I was reminded on Monday of something that was called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum . &quot;
experts critic@@ ise public health report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people , partly with links to the tobacco industry , researchers said . &quot;
&quot; experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , Lanc@@ et joined by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( p@@ he ) in her report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes . &quot;
he published the &quot; Basic Report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have questioned the load capacity of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month resor@@ ted to the &quot; extraordinarily wind@@ y foundation &quot; on which he founded his most important conclusion .
two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot;
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of efficacy . &quot;
they said that the public expects that the claim of p@@ he that &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 individuals who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to conduct their opinions on the damages of different ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products into a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summ@@ ar@@ ised in a research report . &quot;
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health whose directors had previously received British American Tob@@ acco ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
&quot; he also signed the references of BA@@ T for public health in a sustainability report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants at the meeting declared to receive funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the financing that he was supposed to have received after reports from the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International , they added . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for the selection of the members of the committee are not delivered , but there are several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which also include a sector financing in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
&quot; at the meeting , the tobacco management of p@@ he took part . &quot;
&quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; indicates that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products in most criteria &quot; , &quot; said Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these links or restrictions will be discussed in the p@@ he report . &quot;
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that the claims of p@@ he that &quot; there was so far no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes should be used as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers . &quot;
&quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well @-@ being at p@@ he , said that BM@@ J was already re@@ acted . &quot;
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second lifel@@ ong smo@@ ker dies in his addiction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; p@@ he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence proves and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; nearly 80@@ ,000 people annually die of a disease related to smoking , and smoking will cost the National Health System two billion pounds per year . &quot;
&quot; by explaining current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; BBC should give up East@@ En@@ ders , says former boss of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK channels .
he critici@@ zed the BBC for making public @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience to place in hard @-@ controversial time@@ frames against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and transm@@ it@@ ters like BB@@ C@@ 4 .
&quot; after the BBC General Director , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he had tried for six years at Channel 4 without any success to get in touch with the BBC . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which would also clearly be shown by non @-@ subsi@@ dis@@ ed ri@@ vals , &quot; Johnson said to the Ober@@ haus Communications Committee as part of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the broadcasting fee , what I don &apos;t think of a good idea in the medium or long term , you should at least put his production on programs that others don &apos;t do or commissioned . &quot;
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve the wid@@ est possible support for their future .
&quot; the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it is of course non@@ sense . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said , &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax scheme was financed , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions . &quot;
&quot; to be honest , other channels would give their right arm to it . &quot;
I want to see how this should be public television .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC in general .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepreneur for series , who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC was to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of the people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular broad@@ casts are what the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh , suggested that the BBC shows how East@@ er@@ ders should sell . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they fulfill their tasks and they can argue , if they go to their apparent concessions for justi@@ fying 4 billion pounds of broadcasting fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that nobody has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window where no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; at the broadcasting fee , Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value here . &quot;
&quot; of course , we all think that one gets a great value for 150 ¬£ a year , but for people who have a lot of money for the 150 ¬£ , I wonder if this is true because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 leader David El@@ stein , who also testified before the Tuesday Committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check its &quot; &quot; Rei@@ thi@@ an Mission &quot; , &quot; to inform , train and enter@@ tain . &quot;
&quot; he said that little of the BBC &apos;s production would now be officially classified as education - he said that there are 1 % of their TV production and 0,1 % on the radio - and they should take an example in &quot; inform@@ ing , enligh@@ tening and talking &quot; on the public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada . &quot;
&quot; to the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said that the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful are shown on TV , and with the commercial transm@@ it@@ ters will enter alliances to make everything available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are be@@ amed with sound impulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems which can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment when they reson@@ ate with sound impulses that have too high frequencies for human hearing to be heard .
&quot; the impulses work through the power @-@ on of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells , which are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels , which respond to ultras@@ onic waves . &quot;
more on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new procedure called Son@@ o@@ genetics , where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace the depths of brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electric impulses to the brain of people for the treatment of symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; thread worms generally do not respond to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic bubbles . &quot;
&quot; the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultras@@ onic waves , which then penetrate into the worms . &quot;
&quot; the ampli@@ fied ultras@@ onic waves act on structures , which are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in the membranes of some of the worms . &quot;
&quot; the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such as a report of Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Hal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels . &quot;
&quot; when ultras@@ onic is applied to the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ ves@@ icles and transferred to worms , where they turn on the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the process has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground @-@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , which has to be sent down to the desired spot in the brain by an optical fiber , low @-@ frequency ultras@@ onic waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily become suscep@@ tible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

&quot; they have done a fantastic job by helping us to raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty . &quot;

eight golden rules for life in student residen@@ ces
&quot; eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old , I moved to a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se sm@@ iles of those I have anger@@ ed - and to the numerous , lengthy complaints about others . &quot;
most of what I have learned can be disti@@ lled into eight simple rules .
the entrance to student residen@@ ces ranges from slightly nerve @-@ popping up to absolutely frigh@@ tening .
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to ch@@ attering : people tell where you come from , whether and where you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ ane , where you stand in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you frank@@ ly tell Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in ear@@ nest , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like in contrast to those with whom you would not speak even if your eyel@@ ashes were burnt in flames and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be .
let people .
&quot; people often turn into drinks reception , movie night venues and municipal meetings , but they are also the places where people dress and their under@@ wear . &quot;
related to this : do not remember to start with a relationship at the university
intro@@ ver@@ ted receive a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; your room should be a refuge , but many student residen@@ ces form a space @-@ to @-@ room stroll culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifel@@ ong friendship . &quot;
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
&quot; nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I get back the energy I used to interact with you . &quot;
try to feel when a con@@ vivi@@ ality is exhausted by con@@ vivi@@ ality - and send it an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
apro@@ pos t@@ apping : do it .
a guy in my student residen@@ ces had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friend@@ ships close by baking .
&quot; since you start the university at the climax of back @-@ man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people to imagine with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &apos;s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I &apos;ve baked something like you . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to close friend@@ ships .
your room@@ mates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain themselves and eventually will associate your face with a delicious surprise at the end .
&quot; of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker . &quot;
&quot; badly mixed lum@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat bring people to sleep when you kno@@ ck . &quot;
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student residen@@ ces .
&quot; of course , the c@@ law of chicken is a theft , but is it the taking of a drop of mil@@ ch for your tea too ? &quot;
check that with the milk owner .
&quot; chances are that they say to use themselves , even if they cook inside . &quot;
&quot; if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it as my room@@ mate , adding a pur@@ ge to her milk to punish thi@@ eves . &quot;
she is now in prison .
you should not make any noise that stops people from sleep or from work .
&quot; it &apos;s not just about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people in the tru@@ est sense of what is in the glass house . &quot;
&quot; a girl in my hall@@ way asked her neighbors whether it makes them a little bit qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
they responded to this with more loud music .
&quot; when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbors to sleep two hours before she let down her own music , shut down her door and went to her three hour test . &quot;
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same student residence ?
&quot; conver@@ sely , if you hold a room@@ mate for your future spouse , get rid of her , separate herself and see her every day , and perhaps experience how she draws together all common friends ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes on its own ways - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk to your abdom@@ en a little reason . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment when you notice that someone has his keys in his non @-@ closed room , the boundary between an ul@@ k and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good deal is funny , but it only takes moments until he becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
teach by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson about security - but never cut someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
&quot; close your door and place your keys in a glass of water , which you then put into the freezer - but do not t@@ ack their possessions at the ceiling any more than twice . &quot;
&quot; holiday homes for Refu@@ ge@@ es , single @-@ family , Ger@@ ing@@ ser@@ ge@@ er &quot;
the real estate entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner is building terra@@ ced houses for people who don &apos;t have much money .
&quot; for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need housing space , but also the only educ@@ ative mother and the needy . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build and build good today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview . &quot;
thousands of refugees will be pushing for the housing market .
entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ bert believes to know how quickly cheaper living space can be created : he builds in a project terra@@ ced housing for refugees .
&quot; Mr Gil@@ dner , many refugees will be pushing for the housing market . &quot;
which solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ bert : the mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
because people stay in a large part here .
&quot; in view of the flow of refugees , we also need sufficient living space in the coming decades . &quot;
a completely ban@@ al three @-@ story town@@ house is the solution .
Gil@@ bert : a terra@@ ced house needs the least space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different when you put people in blocks .
&quot; each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it can be that many refugees will say it is again peace , I go back . &quot;
then the houses can be easily modified according to their needs .
how high are the costs ?
&quot; Gil@@ bert : the price for 160 square meters of living per house amounts to 18@@ 4 000 euros , without plot . &quot;
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction lasted six months .
this is appropriate .
have the building regulations complicated their plans ?
&quot; Gil@@ bert : on the other hand , I made my project correctly . &quot;
&quot; especially complicated , it always makes the im@@ pending Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the parking ordin@@ ance ordin@@ ance . &quot;
cre@@ ep@@ y .
&quot; it is still under@@ lined , who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three pitches . &quot;
only in the cities is missing the place .
and refugees and asylum seekers do not have cars .
how did the residents react to their town@@ house project ?
Gil@@ bert : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
which is definitely not right .
but don &apos;t you tigh@@ ten the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
&quot; Gil@@ bert : true , we had a construction boom in Germany in the last five years , but built were luxury apartments that can hardly afford more . &quot;

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS when Apple update is released
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the recruitment app , tap &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it is ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install . &quot;
&quot; some have encountered problems after installation , as they get an error message inform@@ ing that the &quot; &quot; software update failed &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to avoid the problem , users are advised to either wait until the attack goes back or attempt to update via iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
&quot; this may mean clearing apps to create space , but Apple has made it more impro@@ b@@ able by reducing the updates . likewise , it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re @-@ install them once the process is complete . &quot;
it is worthwhile to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger so that the battery is charged .
&quot; if the load is too low , Apple doesn &apos;t allow the update to continue as the phone may switch to half way and this might lead to a breakdown of the update . &quot;

&quot; you should also make sure that you have seen our chec@@ kl@@ ist of all things before your download to prevent things going wrong and protect yourself if they do it yet . iOS 9 brings new features , including a much wis@@ er personal assistant and enormous new productivity features for the iPad , as well as changes that accelerate and repair the operating system . &quot;
Ros@@ berg &apos;s only motto : full Att@@ acks
N@@ ico Ros@@ berg knows only one motto in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team @-@ mate Lewis Hamilton : &quot; full Att@@ acks . &quot;
&quot; before the start , the World Cup second emphas@@ ised the decisive seven overseas races , &quot; that I have nothing more to lose . &quot;
53 points separate the vice @-@ champion before the second race in Singapore this Sunday from defending champion and two @-@ fold champion Hamilton .
&quot; the Brit@@ on already won seven of the twelve rounds of the season , and will also start the flood light Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite . &quot;
2009 and last year the 30 year old Brit@@ on was able to win the race .
whether the current smo@@ g will have an influence in the city state at the Grand Prix of Singapore is still unclear .
&quot; for days a ha@@ ze bell is hanging over the city , triggered by fires on the neighbouring island of Sum@@ atra . &quot;
bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
&quot; the Schach@@ club Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen , which was founded three months ago , has added a further member to its ranks , thus increasing the number of members to 19 players . &quot;
&quot; the new member is the entrepreneur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player , who took over 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen to K@@ ur . &quot;
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the bearer of the first class and honorary citizen of the cities of Esp@@ el@@ kam@@ p and L@@ √ºb@@ be@@ cke .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation that President Alfred Klein received .
&quot; thus it is possible to record chess players , who cannot collect the membership fee . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; youth work and talent research should also be pushed forward . &quot;
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that the membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; red @-@ white &quot; is seen as an expression of his connection with the spa town .
district offices search for direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the geri@@ atric centre Anton@@ isti@@ ft have merged under the man@@ tle of the social foundation and opened a new point of contact at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg Square .
&quot; in addition to consultations , you can also take part in courses . &quot;
the social foundation desc@@ ends from the mountain into the inner city .
&quot; more precisely , to the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz . &quot;
a new district office recently opened there .
&quot; here , directly next to the shopping market , Sen@@ iors and Rat@@ ings receive information on issues such as nursing insurance or health care insurance . &quot;
&quot; for years , we have been working with our out@@ patient nursing staff that often care@@ gi@@ vers are left alone . &quot;
there are infin@@ itely many questions .
&quot; the new master &apos;s master Jutta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the B√ºrger@@ sp@@ ital as well as for the ambul@@ ant service &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us , &quot; also hardly ever claimed many benefits of the insurance companies , &quot; explained the new landlord , Jutta Wei@@ g@@ and . &quot;
&quot; in addition to consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat . &quot;
&quot; therefore , additional offers such as assault prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapy can be used . &quot;
the offers from the sen@@ iors centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
&quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation . &quot;
&quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; said Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , CEO of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot;
the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city center sees both business leaders particularly in demographic change .
this makes a good de@@ centralised infrastructure indispensable in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future .
&quot; in addition , as Mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined during the inauguration celebrations , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the harmon@@ isation of old age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular soci@@ able con@@ co@@ ction . &quot;
this makes the social foundation a big contribution that sen@@ iors can live independently and well in their familiar surroundings .
&quot; the office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Satur@@ days from 10 : 00 to 12 : 00 . &quot;

Vienna architect Karl M@@ ang passed 92 years old
&quot; Karl M@@ ang , one of the Do@@ y@@ ens of Vienna &apos;s architecture , is dead . &quot;
&quot; he died on 5 September at the age of 92 , as the K√ºnst@@ l@@ erhaus on Tuesday shared . &quot;
&quot; with M@@ ang , the K√ºnst@@ l@@ erhaus receives an honorary member and at the same time &quot; one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna , &quot; as it meant in the dispatch . &quot;
&quot; born in Vienna in 1922 , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Technical College in Vienna at Friedrich Leh@@ mann after the Second World War . &quot;
&quot; since 1952 he worked as a freelance architect , but also worked as a teacher , writer and institute director . &quot;
he was President of the Austrian Institute of Design from 1972 to 1983 .
&quot; in the 80s , he was commissioned to set up the treas@@ ury in the Hof@@ burg Palace and the reconstruction of the Palais Lob@@ ko@@ witz in the Austrian Theatre Museum . &quot;

&quot; according to his own statement , he wants to have 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the past two years . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he did not assign the intellectual . &quot;
&quot; in the city of Bremen , the grass had just cut off the hair when he saw a parking space guard standing outside for his white Chev@@ ro@@ let Cam@@ aro . &quot;
&quot; as a result , Wiese was stor@@ med out of the business , insul@@ ted the civil servants and threw her the fine fine of money in front of her feet , as reported in the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper . &quot;
&quot; in the city of Bremen , one confirms the accus@@ ations , but it is not clear about the consequences for the unusual incident . &quot;
&quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; &quot; says the city of Bremen . &quot;

men beat a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
&quot; witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ m√ºn@@ ster : on Friday evening , at about 23.@@ 45 , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ m√ºn@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; one from the group , a sevent@@ een @-@ year @-@ old Afghan , followed the police with his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him . &quot;
at that time the group was at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three persons on the grounds of the gas station .
&quot; one of these men now shou@@ ted to the young man , and struck him with his fist . &quot;
the victim suffered a nas@@ al rup@@ ture here and bleeding heavily from the nose .
&quot; when his two friends ha@@ st@@ ened and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ cket , he first left his victim . &quot;
&quot; from his friends , the injured young man was brought home . &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator followed the group with a passenger car to their apartment and drove there demonstr@@ atively several times .
&quot; when you did not see the car any more , the injured person went in front of the building to smoke a cigarette . &quot;
there he was attacked again by the bat and another male person .
&quot; under the aid of a stroke , one applied to the face and the th@@ igh of the victim . &quot;
the injured had to be taken to a hospital for medical care .
&quot; to date , there is only a vag@@ ue report description . &quot;
one of the men was about 1.@@ 80 meters tall .
the second ra@@ cket was about 1.@@ 65 meters tall and was dressed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .

Dr. Frank M√ºller succ@@ eeds in field breaks and has invested ‚Ç¨ 3@@ 10@@ 000
Silvia M√ºller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank M√ºller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen .
&quot; also , the mayor of Zambia , Bernd Bor@@ mann , econom@@ ist U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also pleased . &quot;
&quot; doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are missing in many places in the country : Dr. Frank M√ºller takes over the field of Fel@@ lows on 1 October . &quot;
&quot; while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still on the side of his successor in the next few months . &quot;
&quot; after a reconstruction phase , M√ºller opens the practice on October 12 , until then he will invest 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros in the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ stra√üe 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was sympathy at first sight , when the standing of the field came to know Frank M√ºller and his wife Dr. Silvia M√ºller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who currently completes their medical training at the Ver@@ den hospital and also wants to enter into practice . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the rub@@ b@@ ish would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ breaks and laughs . &quot;
&quot; when it was so far , I just called it . &quot;
the couple Mu@@ eller liked the idea of running their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; the proximity and the constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old mil@@ ler . &quot;
we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years .
&quot; as an advantage , he also seems to be his own boss . &quot;
and so it was agreed that the rub@@ b@@ ish bought the house with the practice .
&quot; however , they continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; the two @-@ time family father Frank M√ºller grew up there , followed his medical studies in Hanover in several doctor &apos;s sur@@ geri@@ es as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , where he was appointed Senior Consult@@ ant in Di@@ ep@@ holz in 2009 and is involved in the DR@@ K @-@ willingness of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; from September 19 , the practice will be prepared for the new boss . &quot;
&quot; during the surgeon Dr Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ste@@ ausen , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ ist ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the rub@@ b@@ ish , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle down as a general practitioner . &quot;
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia M√ºller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot;
&quot; after the conversion , the rooms will look more modern . &quot;
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress EC@@ Gs and need a speaking room more .
&quot; in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed . &quot;
&quot; in the framework of a funding program from the administrative district ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) as well as the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) , the rub@@ b@@ ish will receive a supplement of 50,000 euros . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is continued , &quot; emphasizes Sam@@ t@@ ner mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; according to Silvia M√ºller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 2,000 patients come into practice in the field of rock breaks every quarter , in the north German average practice it is about 500 . &quot;
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another house practice .
a positive side @-@ effect of the takeover by Frank M√ºller : the pharmacy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen .
&quot; if no follow@@ er would have found himself , she would have gone . &quot;
&quot; by the way , who visits M√ºll@@ ers &apos;s surgery , also continues to look above all in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning force of the wheels . &quot;
&quot; with their departure in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era ends , after all the doctors have practiced for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; recalls Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen sm@@ iles . &quot;
&quot; after a long time , she felt a little bit of melanch@@ oly . &quot;
&quot; but we continue to stay in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will surely see many patients often , &quot; &quot; says the intern@@ ist . &quot;
her husband adds : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter plot . &quot;
&quot; until now , I have always pressed myself before gardening , now that could be different . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; we let the refugees pass through
&quot; now the border controls are also hit at our southern border , &quot; said Interior Minister Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
&quot; as before , it is clear that anyone who wants to submit an asylum application can do so &quot; of course . &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people is in the foreground .
&quot; but it is also clear that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; people must know that we do not accept bor@@ der@@ less migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia sub@@ mits &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia refuses
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wants to continue travelling to Austria and Germany and under certain circumstances establish cor@@ ri@@ d@@ ore for the refugees .
&quot; for quite this , however , this Interior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ √∂r@@ k√∂@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach did not see . &quot;
&quot; the idea of corri@@ dors is &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the monitoring of the border - especially to Hungary . &quot;
&quot; the border with Croatia , on the other hand , is already strongly controlled as the outer boundary of the Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; as the minister pointed out , Slovenia hopes not to seal its borders for refugees . &quot;
&quot; every EU member must fulfill its obligations otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ √∂r@@ k√∂@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours to Tuesday to pass by in eastern Croatia at the border crossing of T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to avoid registration . &quot;
the Croatian police could attack them in the nearby fields of corn .
&quot; according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik is constantly meeting new refugees with new refugees . &quot;
&quot; it deals predominantly with Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children . &quot;
rescue services and the Red Cross are also in use .
&quot; in the coming days , his country comp@@ lies with some 4,000 refugees , said Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo on the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border , would have re@@ directed Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; however , the Belgrade government denied that it was that people approach certain routes : &quot; neither we , nor do we want to do this , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; according to the media reports , a first bus with around 50 refugees has arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id in the morning , in the course of the day further buses would be expected . &quot;
&quot; about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
the in@@ mates were the whole night away from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border around 500 kilometres away from Serbia .
&quot; we heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel further to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
&quot; thus , the postpon@@ ement of the previous Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary could actually come to a somewhat more west@@ erly direction . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive border control options &quot;
Croatia &apos;s interior minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country has prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; he did not call for details , but indicated that Croatia was a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot; &quot;
follow strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently issued a good report to the country , concerning the standard of border controls . &quot;
&quot; on Serbian side , about 300 refugees are still stuck behind the Hungarian border fence . &quot;
&quot; according to Belgian media reports , they would have spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ os , which leads to R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings of Hor@@ os and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain closed completely . &quot;
&quot; if the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border , it is still unclear . &quot;
&quot; the Serbian interior minister , N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic , tried to calm down Wednesday early on a local appearance in Hor@@ os : he considers the debates on alternative routes of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed , for premature . &quot;
it would not be a very high number of refugees at the moment .
&quot; one could not yet say whether they would continue their journey over Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
hel@@ pers advise migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already begun distributing maps to the refugees on which alternative routes are drawn through Croatia . &quot;
&quot; the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area , there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatia war , there are still un@@ cleared min@@ e@@ fields . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clean@@ ers was sent to the border region . &quot;
h@@ ack@@ ers h@@ ack@@ ers : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
&quot; Sup@@ ran@@ o@@ ok should have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber criminals who have been accused of having gained insight into un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites like Business Wire , Market@@ place , and PR News@@ wire since 2010 . &quot;

&quot; according to the investig@@ ators , more than 100 million dollars were launched . &quot;

&quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among the people , &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot;
the leader of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce remedy is available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as questions and conversations as the volunteer staff .
&quot; while some fit spontaneously to the chal@@ k and read the sentence &quot; &quot; my life &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; can read &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; not suffer for long &quot; , &quot; others stay short , read , say sentences like &quot; &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; &quot; and then go on . &quot;
&quot; again and again little discussions develop on the br@@ ink of the action itself , about life , dealing with dying . &quot;

&quot; therefore , this public @-@ effective action is good for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; however , the fact that not everyone wants to share publicly on the boards is understandable , but it is a very personal matter . &quot;

&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ earnings mixed , financial prospects for 2016 lowered &quot;
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter and the delivery giant extracts its profit from the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its body transport service .
&quot; the company also said that it plans to hire 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holiday . &quot;
&quot; at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season . &quot;
the share fell by 2.5 percent in pre@@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit between 10.@@ 40 $ and 10.@@ 90 $ in the financial year ending in May , 20 cent less than in previous forecast . &quot;
analysts expected a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10.@@ 84 $ .
&quot; the lower prospect , despite the price increases , will amount to 4.@@ 9 percent and will be effective on January 4 , and in spite of higher impacts on bo@@ d@@ ging transport of heavy and large packages , which will be collected from November . &quot;
&quot; the company said it nonetheless expected that the result will increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenue and growth in online retail . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company will yield &quot; solid earnings , &quot; considering the weaker as expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; plans for holiday employment were announced a day later than that of the rival U@@ PS , who plans to hire 9@@ 0.000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , such as the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter that ended on August 31 , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; earnings per share amounted to 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just below the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve analysts predicted by Z@@ acks Investment Research . &quot;
sales increased by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion $ .
six of Z@@ acks asked analysts expected to $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
&quot; in recent years F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority shipping , which brought sales in its unit express shipping to the international level . &quot;
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; in the last quarter , net transport sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
&quot; the Express unit recorded higher revenue due to higher prices , while the result decreased because of higher operating costs in the cargo business . &quot;
&quot; in the pre@@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares fell by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , they concluded with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 . &quot;
&quot; on the most expected meeting in the year , Federal Reserve Strate@@ gies spend two days this week sitting around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it &apos;s time to raise the body for the first time for almost a decade . &quot;
&quot; lo@@ oming over them at an end of the orn@@ ate , two @-@ storey conference hall is a mur@@ al of the United States . &quot;
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed Chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation in front of all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ fold order from Congress : maxim@@ izing U.S. employment and prices here stable .
&quot; but since the big recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision which is too narrow to predict it . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from the unprecedented incentive by the short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
&quot; although most of the economy &apos;s data show that it grows solid , the latest tur@@ mo@@ il on the global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives anxious to reinforce this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and be it just a quarter percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation in the first place will be the most important thing they observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker@@ age company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which sec@@ ures itself the financial market itself . &quot;
about half of the econom@@ ists who were recently asked by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted an increase in interest this week .
&quot; however , the financial markets expect the F@@ ed to wait , with a key indicator that only shows a 30 % chance of an increase . &quot;
&quot; this suggests a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts mi@@ tig@@ ate the impact by promising that another increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial average jumped by 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that point , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she does it , she would have to go very far in her explanation to calm the financial markets so that she did not panic . &quot;
other experts argued that an interest increase would so@@ ot@@ he the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
&quot; one month ago , the F@@ ed seemed to have a good way to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , she expected more economic advance to increase the sentence . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of jobs slow@@ ed down in August , the improvement on the labour market was solid this year . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest since more than seven years and near the level that the F@@ ed sees as full employment . &quot;
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Mac@@ ro@@ economics . &quot;
&quot; but the financial markets all over the world sent together at the end of last month , after China had de@@ valued its currency . &quot;
the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage Rate fell by more than 16 % in May when investors feared that a slow@@ down in the Chinese economy would cur@@ b global growth .
&quot; the market has recovered somewhat this month , although the Dow is now about 10 % below the top of May . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ences affect the complex calculation , when to increase interest rates . &quot;
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks , they would tigh@@ ten the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former member of the US staff . &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to get the impact better .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the health of the world economy is none of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be taken into account in terms of decision making . &quot;
but in the end the F@@ ed Monetary Authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
&quot; the mere hint of the former director , Ben S. Bern@@ anke in the year 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; &quot; narrow &quot; &quot; their monetary expansion , triggered del@@ u@@ sions around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives can be expected to not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; her decision making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the Global Strategy for Asset Management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements , which apparently are not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
&quot; Lack@@ ier , authorized member of the Federal Open Market Committee , which sets up for a rise in interest , cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its key interest by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions , &quot; despite limited noticeable effects on growth in the US , &quot; said Lack@@ ier . &quot;
&quot; one year later , the F@@ ed representatives cancelled the cuts . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability to the first place only during a severe crisis such as market re@@ unification in 2008 , said Adam S P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on Inter@@ est Investment of the Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; the latest tur@@ mo@@ il does not come near this plain , he said . &quot;
&quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of interest in interest because the markets are rising , &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until this is changed , I don &apos;t think it should hurry the time . &quot;
do you need a great Thai market ?

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Life Help for Refu@@ ge@@ es
more and more refugees are coming to Germany this day .
&quot; to prepare a warm welcome , does not work without the commitment of countless volunteers . &quot;
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city .
Petra and Klaus H@@ eine are among them .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still loves to teach her 74 list@@ ings .
every Thursday she is doing it in the asylum seek@@ er at the D@@ ill@@ inger Stra√üe .
&quot; it helps refugees from Syria , Kurdist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language . &quot;
&quot; of course , this is a different lesson than at a proper school . &quot;
Brazilian Pap@@ di@@ at@@ ric Society Rio Grande supports nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian Pap@@ al Organisation SP@@ RS tries to elu@@ ci@@ date women in a sho@@ cking way how important good nutrition is during breast@@ feeding .
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research results suggest that higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary change that mothers should do . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system . &quot;
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Spor@@ thalle
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the construction proposal for the 2.3 million euros expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be fl@@ atten@@ ed for solar panels .
&quot; the planning for the long @-@ awaited turn@@ out building at the Bern@@ ried Sport@@ premises is progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent council meeting , the completed construction proposal was unanim@@ ously approved without major discussions . &quot;
&quot; previously , among other things , the committee had approved an application for a legislative &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; or &quot; deliver@@ ance &quot; from the valid planning plan . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; it was permission for a special form concerning the roof construction . &quot;
&quot; according to this , a &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ mit@@ ek first and roof over@@ hang &quot; is to be built . &quot;
&quot; planning is the planned use of the roof surface for solar systems : &quot; &quot; this brings together a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot;
&quot; in the case of &quot; liberation , &quot; it was again about the inclin@@ ation that was prescribed for energetic reasons - different from the building plan - below 10 degrees . &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the building plan for roof inclin@@ ation permits no &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; - with the Bern@@ rie@@ der Municipal Council as a rule rather restric@@ tive in liber@@ ating applications . &quot;
&quot; however , this is not a recurring project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the gymn@@ as@@ tics hall at the Sports Centre is a community project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
&quot; at the expense of costs , some 2.3 million euros have been calculated . &quot;
subsidies are expected from school and l@@ ati@@ tudes .
&quot; in the next step , the construction application for the 18 x 36 @-@ meter @-@ large hall will be presented to the Federal Council of Agriculture . &quot;
P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg Clinic moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
&quot; the P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg Hospital is planned to be closed earlier than planned , namely 2016 . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital . &quot;
the station as well as the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; this shows the surprising plans of the county GmbH of the county , confirmed by the Coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü . &quot;
&quot; however , a decision on the Supervisory Board meets the Supervisory Board , and it conven@@ es on Wednesday , 23 September . &quot;
&quot; if the plans were to be implemented , nearly 50 people would be employed at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg . &quot;
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the further existing In@@ ner Station .
the rooms are available .
&quot; in Wei@@ l@@ heim a workplace is to be offered to the employees who do not work with Sch@@ ong@@ au , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü . &quot;
the employees are informed of the plans .
&quot; the change was triggered by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been a medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Klinik since the beginning of the year and is now moving to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; on the question of who is to take the succession , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; who agreed to take the lead from October 1 and change with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this means in every case a &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the offer in the area &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; , &quot; as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü . &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized on the In@@ ner Station on gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
&quot; for the next two years , Fischer with his team , if the Supervisory Board agrees to agree to both houses , until next year , the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ y , which has more than 35 beds , shall finally be closed in P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg after almost 140 years . &quot;
&quot; until now , the administrative district had planned this for 2018 , when the current refurb@@ ishment has been completed at Wei@@ l@@ heim Hospital . &quot;
&quot; Mr. J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü , who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , with@@ drew rum@@ ors that the House , which is owned by the Federal Republic of Germany , will be used as accommodation for asylum seekers in the future . &quot;
&quot; I close this up . &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü could not say there are several considerations . &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a day@@ care psychiat@@ ry .
&quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come back , &quot; says Fischer about the move to the Le@@ ch , which had been &quot; positive and understanding &quot; by the employees . &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as a chief physician for more than 30 years , has not given it . &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
&quot; the hospital P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was threatened again and again during the past decades , departments were closed , for example surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics . &quot;
the Hand@@ b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar Li@@ ons are demanded tonight at Berg@@ ischen HC tonight ( 8.@@ 15 pm ) .
&quot; although the league leader of the Bundes@@ liga is the clear favourite in Wuppertal , there is no reason for arrogan@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; in the past season , the Bad@@ ener has a painful defeat at the Bh@@ c and got something good there . &quot;
hunting du@@ et with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been severely injured during their maize harvesting on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) , several hunters were in use , as the police shared . &quot;
after a shot a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were put into hospitals .
&quot; how exactly it happened to the accident , was initially unclear . &quot;
the Krimin@@ al@@ poli@@ zei ( Criminal Police ) has been established .
16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violence crimes
a suspect has led the police to the corp@@ se of 16 @-@ year @-@ olds from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate who have been missing since Saturday .
&quot; in the inter@@ rog@@ ation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted having killed the young people and threw their bodies into a channel in rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
&quot; a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , who has been missing since Saturday , has fallen victim to violence . &quot;
&quot; the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as the public prosec@@ utor and police told on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; as a matter of fact , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old is also considered suspect on Tuesday evening , who , in fact , indic@@ ted the statement and led the investig@@ ators to the discovery site of the corp@@ se . &quot;
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after she had not come home after a visit to a autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
&quot; in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators first met personal bel@@ ong@@ ings of the victim . &quot;
&quot; in the case of surveys in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the mi@@ sts , there was finally a criminal investigation against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
the alleged perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the corp@@ se was found .
&quot; according to the authorities , the police suspected that the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was killed and the bodies laid in the canal . &quot;
&quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented on Wednesday to the port fun@@ nel , the investig@@ ators put him dead . &quot;
conclusions about the closer circumstances of the act should bring further investigations .
refugees need accommodation : study warns against housing gap
the situation in the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are seeking an affordable stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution of distribution in the German housing market has long since begun .
&quot; with the incoming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many large cities . &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
&quot; to meet demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; this results in a study commissioned by the &quot; &quot; social housing construction &quot; &quot; association . &quot;
&quot; by comparison , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are ready in Germany this year . &quot;
&quot; thus , 140@@ ,000 dwell@@ ings are missing . &quot;
&quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer oblig@@ ated to live as asylum seekers in an initial accommodation facility . &quot;
many then hit the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
&quot; according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent last year . &quot;
&quot; the negative development of the housing market , however , is not only due to the rising number of refugees . &quot;
the study also makes significant failures in the housing policy of recent years .
&quot; Germany will be shooting a budget deficit , which will increase from year to year . &quot;
&quot; currently there are already approximately 77@@ ,000 housing units in the metrop@@ olitan areas , lam@@ inated Matthias G√ºnther , author of the study . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , many professionals were living in large cities in need of WG @-@ rooms . &quot;
young adults remained un@@ willing to stay in the &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; because of the lu@@ te in the housing market .
&quot; in the large cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita in recent years has declined again for the first time . &quot;
&quot; in order to solve the problem , the &quot; social housing construction &quot; alliance proposes a restart . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , new incentives should boost the social housing construction . &quot;
&quot; in this way , a tax exemp@@ tion tax could be wai@@ ved and the basic tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats can be suspended . &quot;
&quot; in addition , according to the Alliance , attractive tax depreci@@ ation options are required . &quot;
the funding program for refugee dwell@@ ings of the Kf@@ W State Bank is already well received in cities and municipalities .
&quot; a good week after the start , with 18@@ 4 million euros , more than half of the available EUR 300 million had been retri@@ eved on Monday evening . &quot;
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free validity : Croatia and Slovenia set up corridor
&quot; after Hungary there is practically no diar@@ rhe@@ a anymore , as more and more refugees choose the way over Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb is announ@@ cing that the transit through Slovenia leads to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
&quot; however , the route is dangerous . &quot;
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; I spoke to the Slov@@ ene Minister of the Interior , and if necessary , we will organise a corridor , &quot; said Croatian Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
the EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
&quot; after the de@@ position of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees broke out to Croatia to reach Western Europe . &quot;
&quot; 500 people came across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian TV station RT@@ L . &quot;
Hungary had sealed its border for refugees on the eve of the day .
&quot; in addition , new laws which entered into force on the same day are practically superf@@ lu@@ ous in Hungary . &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic explained , &quot; You can travel through and we prepare for this possibility . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;
&quot; however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia . &quot;
the Croatian police took up the first refugees on the border of Serbia in the morning to the EU neighbouring country of Croatia .
&quot; most of the media reports have been reported from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they came both by bus and taxis to the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
&quot; immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk over the green border to Croatia . &quot;
&quot; at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not reach border f@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; for this , the border strip poses other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 1990s . &quot;
mine clearance should now quickly create a safe passage .
&quot; according to Hungary , however , there are hardly any more refugees after the closure of the border . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the police included 3@@ 66 people . &quot;
just before the closure on Monday it was still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws prec@@ lu@@ de the overcoming and damage of the border fence as a crime .
&quot; therefore , 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the Sz@@ eg@@ ed border town in Hungary . &quot;
the convic@@ ted thre@@ aten prison sentences of up to five years and expul@@ sion from the country .
&quot; according to the immigration authority , I received a total of 94 asylum applications on Tuesday in the newly established &quot; &quot; Tran@@ sit zones &quot; , &quot; of which almost all - 93 - at the most important crossing of R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two older people .
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees detained .
&quot; in practice , no one has a prospect of granting asylum in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers are to be de@@ ported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke .
&quot; in R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke , workers began to clean up with it . &quot;
&quot; they collected garbage , leaving tens of thousands of people in the past few weeks at the road@@ side . &quot;
&quot; barrier screens were disman@@ tled , and one of the recordings in the Grenz@@ ort was rebuilt . &quot;
no one wanted to express himself at the goal of this reconstruction .
&quot; after the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria only reaches a few refugees . &quot;
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
&quot; but , according to government information , the 20,000 migrants were still in the country . &quot;
&quot; in Salzburg , some 1,@@ 400 people are waiting for the continuation of the journey to Germany . &quot;
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning by order of German authorities .
&quot; in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees arrived on foot regularly . &quot;
mayor drove &quot; str@@ anded &quot; across the border
&quot; we were busy at the Br√ºck@@ en@@ fest on Sunday with the clearing , when suddenly ten people with travel agents stood at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ stein mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; tourists , they wanted to take the train to Passa@@ u . &quot;
&quot; but because Germany had surprisingly adjusted the railway traffic with Austria on Sunday due to the influ@@ x of refugees , Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the frames along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border to the Nah@@ e Passa@@ u . &quot;
&quot; before that , we first met the un@@ expect@@ edly guests , with snack and drinks . &quot;
&quot; we said the same , we bring them to Passa@@ u by car . &quot;
&quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ √ñ@@ N @-@ conversation . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man didn &apos;t let him take a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; that made us very happy , &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; the str@@ anded train passengers had switched to a regional train in W@@ els from an ICE towards Passa@@ u on Sunday evening in W@@ els , in order to try it after the short notice that the railway traffic was stopped to Germany , but still to try across the border . &quot;
&quot; the regional train , however , was set off at the border in W@@ ern@@ stein at the Inn . &quot;
&quot; in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high in the course . &quot;
&quot; the Br√ºck@@ en@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday was soci@@ able on Sunday , on the day before a Zwei@@ brid@@ le run sporty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ √°n sends further thousands of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy :
&quot; instead of helping in the R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke camp immediately in the establishment of structures to ensure humanity , our Federal Chanc@@ ellery has officially and publicly moved the position of the Hungarian government to the ha@@ ze of national socialism . &quot;
this policy is not only the Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with cha@@ otic conditions in the bor@@ der@@ lands .
&quot; the refugees will also have to notice that the &quot; &quot; promised land &quot; , &quot; which she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will be a great challenge , given the ongoing refugee flows and the approaching winter , to create decent conditions for protection @-@ seekers . &quot;
&quot; and it will be even greater - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
&quot; Konrad at the search for 3@@ 5.000 win@@ try qu@@ arti@@ s &quot;
Konrad drove all hands full with the support of refugees .
Christian Konrad used to have his word weight .
the government has used the former mighty Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to set up quarters for the thousands of refugees .
Con@@ rad has already got a grip on the chaos in the first recording center in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen .
&quot; we have no homeless in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported on his first success . &quot;
&quot; the lodging of the 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday could also be accommodated without a big hu@@ stle , said Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; master performance . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in total , Konrad comp@@ utes 8@@ 5.000 copies in the he@@ ur@@ ly year . &quot;
&quot; in order to meet the number , 3@@ 5.000 accommodation must be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 shall provide the countries , 15,000 of the Con@@ federation . &quot;
&quot; should there be more refugees , we can do it . &quot;
&quot; but it &apos;s not a drum without ground , &quot; Konrad said . &quot;
he has already held talks with the govern@@ ors .
they would have assured him of creating quarters for the coming refugees .
&quot; it works well in Upper Austria , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Mai@@ er . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ ate supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Sch√∂n@@ born and will be clari@@ fied as to how the Church will help .
&quot; the Asyl@@ um Co@@ ordin@@ ator also sets great expectations in the ORF action &quot; &quot; Hel@@ fen wie we &quot; . &quot; &quot;
on the platform private persons can easily provide accommodation .
&quot; in addition , one hopes for hotels that stand empty in the winter . &quot;
&quot; yesterday , Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in times of emergency , it cannot be that qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ers have to adhere to certain height of the hand towel rack or the size of the overhead lights . &quot;
&quot; for a temporary period of time , &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; would have to be considered . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , he is more successful when he is accommodated , Con@@ rad establishes with his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am an older gentle@@ man , whom one does not say without further to the face . &quot;
persu@@ asive power is his most important weapon .
&quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er don &apos;t cause the republic to cost , as they declared themselves . &quot;
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
&quot; up to now , the search for own quarters has not yet been successful . &quot;
Konrad wanted to place a container on Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with the approval .
Linz calls for a better division
&quot; for the time being , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees is planning the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; this is not necessary at the moment , as one can currently support those affected without these measures , &quot; says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , more locations should be tested for their suitability . &quot;
criticism of the city chief on the division of refugees within the federal state .
other districts have to make their contribution here .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; boundaries are not sealed off &quot;
&quot; in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , the Gover@@ nor Josef P@@ √ºhr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday corro@@ des further action in the refugee issue . &quot;
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders were not sealed off .
the transfer of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
&quot; however , there are now the corresponding border controls . &quot;
&quot; for the time being , special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; the investig@@ ators , however , would be brought to Germany by regular trains . &quot;
&quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ √ºhr@@ inger once again called for increased solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot;
&quot; for P@@ √ºhr@@ inger , Austria is now also a logical consequence of the action of the Germans . &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
the restructuring of the &quot; New Wer@@ ft &quot; in the Linz industrial line has been officially completed .
&quot; four of the six floors of the office and production building are the listed IT Group S &amp; T , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square metres ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the Technology area . &quot;
&quot; the clever heads are our raw material in IT - and we have to try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; D CEO Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
he could imagine investing in Star@@ tup companies in the New Wer@@ ft and later on to acquire them .
&quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - in which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises some promises : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; 1.7 million euros have been invested in the site by S &amp; T , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is le@@ ased by Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
&quot; 30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square metres of residual surface in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are inquiries . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened second shop in the arcade
the new shop focuses on Fur@@ la hand@@ bags .
&quot; in fact , Jutta Br@@ eit wanted to buy a dog . &quot;
&quot; this project had to push the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the do@@ ve market Ark@@ ade : after all , she has grown in the form of another business location . &quot;
&quot; in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop where they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing from different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are available from 75 euros . &quot;
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
&quot; before that , several weeks have been reconstructed . &quot;
&quot; but I have thought long , if I want to open a shop , &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot;
&quot; the decisive factor for the decision was that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own location where only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Linz that sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who even have Italian roots . &quot;
her fashion interest has been given birth to her mother in the cra@@ dle .
I am most surprised when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
&quot; why so many women are in rap@@ ture at the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag , the professional woman cannot answer with the last certainty . &quot;
maybe it is because a beautiful bag upgrades every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place whose inhabitants are called An@@ ders .
some people also connect with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ sets .
&quot; whether it concerns x@@ en@@ opho@@ bic , journalists or revealing knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office ki@@ cks the election campaign vigor@@ ously . &quot;
and cuts well .
&quot; this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from . &quot;
&quot; the New Yorker with the &quot; &quot; F@@ √∂hn@@ fr@@ is@@ ur &quot; &quot; is a term for many in the win@@ emaking village on the wine route . &quot;
some in the 1200 inhabitants place is related over -@@ ump@@ y corners with it .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in the campaign mode . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ st√§d@@ ter Sim@@ one Wen@@ del made a film about Tru@@ mp .
and what do villa@@ gers think about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find it exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt way , &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; the native K@@ all@@ st√§d@@ ter has shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous young shoots , which besides Tru@@ mp also counts the ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , arrives in Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt ( 2014 ) too - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
he did not bring it there to the king of the hearts .
&quot; although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also the opinion that Tru@@ mp &quot; is already a bit a big mouth , &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; inci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the radius , &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; - in high German : the employers , she says . &quot;
Tru@@ mp comes from the village of the gi@@ ver .
&quot; the success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated , and in the USA opened a place for gold dig@@ gers . &quot;
corner@@ stone of the real estate company was the first real estate in New York .
&quot; however , the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland in the long run failed at the Bavarian State where the Pal@@ at@@ inate was at that time . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tru@@ mp , because he was once ho@@ ist@@ ed without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , explained to the start of the film . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; illegal immig@@ rant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes striking statements of the descend@@ ant .
he repeatedly claimed about Mexican immigrants in the United States and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; like the Polish one , it is not so symp@@ athetic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative tru@@ mp ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a born Tru@@ mp , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the v@@ int@@ ner in retirement looks more distant from the American , &quot; &quot; he is always so upset . &quot;
does he believe that Tru@@ mp is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt .
&quot; the Pen@@ sion@@ ist Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ramm is mentioned as many K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ at a visit , which generally arrived well . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; they would find it better if he did not win the election because &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had the Sa@@ y at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been like him , &quot; he would never have been there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting themes than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah B√ºh@@ ler . &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; my president is not , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
and : &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the President Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; Wend@@ els Film , for whom Tru@@ mp has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12 000 cinem@@ as , even in the USA the interest is awak@@ ened . &quot;
the Upper Bavarian community Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain@@ eering village . &quot;
&quot; from the hand of the vice @-@ president at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 @-@ inhabitants @-@ village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den national park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday . &quot;
in Austria there are already 20 &quot; mountain climbing villages . &quot;
&quot; in neighbouring countries , the Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award . &quot;
&quot; a &quot; &quot; mountain@@ eering village &quot; &quot; must have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants . &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise dominates the reviews despite attempts from N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at Today Show
&quot; Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son ha@@ sten to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report in connection with the loss of the leadership of the liber@@ als , but there has been no major shifts in the reviews for Today . &quot;
the N@@ ine breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed the overthrow of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
&quot; the rival Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ anth@@ a Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a one @-@ week series of international television programmes , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n . &quot;
&quot; this down@@ side of the resistance seemed to play no part for Australian TV viewers , as Sun@@ rise achieved an average of 39@@ 7.@@ 000 spectators in the five capitals , compared to today 33@@ 9.@@ 000 . &quot;
&quot; today , a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; today , the gap to Sun@@ rise has closed in recent months . &quot;
&quot; in August today , Today reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 3@@ 30,000 of Sun@@ rise . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the distance between 40,000 and 50.000 . &quot;
&quot; up to now in September , sunrise at an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators is at 3@@ 14@@ .000 at Today . &quot;
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning people more than the Parliament !
&quot; Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for the review ! &quot;

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former Seri@@ al of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ter Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father who decides to settle down with his two children on the coast of New Zealand reached a very impressive figure of 1.@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers .
critics were wondering if Thom@@ son could perform a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebe@@ cca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; yes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million spectators and struck slightly The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL family ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 5 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe generated 44@@ 6,000 spectators . &quot;
&quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jumped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small win over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia recorded 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour the 7@@ 20,000 spectators came . &quot;
&quot; hot @-@ Se@@ at an average of 6@@ 20,000 . &quot;
the decline in the odds of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 o &apos;clock .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for one million dollars that didn &apos;t manage to over@@ run the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
mystery revealed ? ...
&quot; L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably have un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly revealed who wins the bach@@ elor . &quot;
&quot; the woman , who eventually lands Sam Wood in The Bachelor , was wrapped up in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
and none of the remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
&quot; but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows on the day before coming from three two , you may have acci@@ dentally given an indication of who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood keeps his lips tightly sealed until the final on Thursday
&quot; all three women have le@@ aked in a ly@@ rical manner about why Wood is the perfect man and they called his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked , &quot; &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; &quot; could become their answers to the game cor@@ rup@@ ter who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors . &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both fast - except for themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood had a simple relationship with each other from the very first day .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and ( Sarah &apos;s ) and S@@ ams energies noticed , I sen@@ sed that they were quite compatible and I thought it all over the show , &quot; &quot; said Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added . &quot;
I saw them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood are good as a couple .
&quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit to the house last week made her clear that wood could be the one . &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ condition@@ ally tuned to him , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked who Wood should choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zz@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it &apos;s a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
&quot; the Bachelor will be broadcast on Ten on Wednesday , 19 : 30 . &quot;

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the US - and there were many other teams who sent inquiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the ban@@ ker when he lost a sc@@ ram@@ ble as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League Con@@ vert during his first pun@@ t return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity for a pun@@ t return and also in the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a still showed his true face in the dressing room after the game .
&quot; instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team , he encouraged them . &quot;
Tom@@ sul@@ a also openly strengthened Hay@@ ne in his press conference after the game .
&quot; the 49@@ er Spor@@ tre@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by specialist team coordinator , Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his missed catch and take care of the next game . &quot;
&quot; Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne picks up a pun@@ t , which was restored in the first game quarter of Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings &quot;
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian followers had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
&quot; after the F@@ um@@ ble , Hay@@ ne left the playing field and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he could not imagine a worse start to his N@@ FL career , &quot;
&quot; that was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; Hay@@ ne said . &quot;
Hay@@ den compared the Schn@@ itzer with his Orig@@ in debut back then in 2007 when a passport at his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

the Free voters demand the hi@@ ring of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees .
&quot; at the beginning of the F@@ W Aut@@ umn Conference in Gro√ü@@ wall@@ stadt , party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned of a serious crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools when there are not new teachers for the many new students : &quot; &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to save schools from collapse , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; otherwise we will get distor@@ tions in the Bavarian educational system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ tag fraction of the Free voters conven@@ ed until Friday in the Frank@@ ish Commune .
&quot; actually , quite different main topics were provided . &quot;
but the record number of refugees now also dominates the Free vot@@ er meeting .
&quot; of course , the subject of asylum will over@@ lap the retreat , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN Prot@@ ected Are@@ as for Refu@@ ge@@ es in Syria , as there were during the war in Yugoslavia in the 1990s . &quot;
&quot; this is not the case , we have to turn to the causes , &quot; said the Free voters chief . &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to post@@ p@@ one the free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; therefore , Ai@@ wan@@ ger asked more staff for the administrative courts that are responsible for asylum law@@ suits : &quot; &quot; we need at least 50 new asylum @-@ inver@@ ters , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
the F@@ W head critici@@ zed that several federal states were not consistent : &quot; we need uniform standards of federal states throughout Germany .
&quot; Bavaria pus@@ hes away , others not . &quot;
&quot; we have to become more action @-@ capable . &quot;
&quot; however , the state policy in Gro√ü@@ wall@@ stadt is not supposed to fall under the table . &quot;
a long lasting tor@@ ment remains on the agenda : the policy of education .
&quot; for the new school year , Minister Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot study &quot; &quot; Mittel@@ stufe plus &quot; , &quot; where an extension of the secondary school secondary stage was tested for three to four years . &quot;
&quot; however , Ai@@ wan@@ ger is not far enough . &quot;
&quot; the issue of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W head . &quot;
we call for freedom of choice for all high school students .

fir@@ mer Wall Street helps D@@ ax to jump on the jumps
&quot; after a long distance , the German stock market closed out with gut@@ ters without any signs of nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; it was only in the afternoon that a strong pr@@ elu@@ de to the US exchanges gave a clear direction , which ultimately promoted the D@@ ax by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8.@@ 13 points upwards . &quot;
the M@@ DA@@ X medium @-@ sized figures won 0.@@ 54 percent to 19 55@@ 2.@@ 88 points .

solid profits also booked trading posts in London and Paris .
&quot; in the US , the Dow Jones Index listed last around 1 percent in plus . &quot;
many B√∂r@@ si@@ ans expect the markets to be placed on the spot until after the interest in the United States and also for the large decline in the fut@@ ures markets .
the debate about the burden of nuclear ph@@ ase@@ out has pushed the shares of RW@@ E on a record low and left deep traces even at E@@ on .
&quot; according to &quot; &quot; Der Spiegel &quot; , &quot; the German energy companies may be missing 30 billion euros for provisions . &quot;
the Federal Government denied the figures mentioned in the press .
&quot; as a result , the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered somewhat , but ultimately always lost 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) . &quot;
&quot; on the D@@ ax peak , Infin@@ eon shares increased by another 3.@@ 22 percent . &quot;
&quot; according to a tra@@ der , a positive report of the US investor magazine &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; took effect from the weekend . &quot;
&quot; according to this , investors are currently paying too little attention to the German chip manufacturer . &quot;
investments in future @-@ looking w@@ afer technologies and the focus should be paid to the car market .
&quot; car values were in demand : even in the traditionally weak summer months of August more cars were sold again than in the same period of the previous year , as the industry association AC@@ EA became the start of the International Motor Show IAA in Frankfurt . &quot;
the car papers of Daimler and BMW grew by 1.@@ 34 percent and 2.@@ 21 percent respectively .
Volkswagen benefits increased by 1.@@ 26 percent .
&quot; at the German pension market , the return on stock of listed federal valu@@ ables fell to 0.@@ 48 ( Friday : 0.@@ 50 ) percent . &quot;
the Re@@ x pension index rose by 0.@@ 12 percent to 13@@ 9.@@ 55 points .
the Con@@ federation Future lost 0.@@ 71 percent to 15@@ 4.@@ 11 points .
&quot; the euro &apos;s course decreased to 1,@@ 12@@ 62 dollars in the afternoon . &quot;
&quot; at noon , the European Central Bank had set the reference rate to USD 1.@@ 13@@ 05 ( 1.@@ 12@@ 68 ) . &quot;
the dollar therefore cost 0.@@ 88@@ 46 ( 0.@@ 88@@ 75 ) Euro .
4 people killed after polic@@ emen shoot rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police fired rubber bul@@ lets into a crowd demonstrating against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ deh@@ i district , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , leading district official , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station , and some of them threw stones and fire@@ bombs . &quot;
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said that the police used tear gas and then shot in the air before rub@@ bing back on rubber bul@@ lets .
&quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the rubber bul@@ lets that are known to kill them , which are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , apparently produce such a high rate of death . &quot;
&quot; the confrontation was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces , formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence . &quot;
there were protests in western Nepal by the ethnic group of Th@@ arus that want their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent clas@@ hes since the 10th . &quot;
&quot; killed in August when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial subject in Nepal , which has been ruled centrally for centuries . &quot;
&quot; the work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008 , but the law@@ makers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; the legislature voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could come into force on Sunday . &quot;
construction area planned in the city
the property at Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post is to be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square metre area .
&quot; a mix of trade , trade and living - concrete proposals are not yet available . &quot;
Em@@ den - Em@@ den wants to market an area around 4000 square meters in direct neighbourhood to the Old Post Art Centre .
the preparations for this are underway .
&quot; it is planned to use the terrain for a mix of trade , trade and living . &quot;
&quot; waiting for appropriate offers , it is called by the city . &quot;
which investor question is not yet clear .
&quot; accordingly , no contracts had been signed . &quot;
the town of Em@@ den had a part of the property that is located on the Ring@@ stra√üe / corner Great Street just a few months ago and the building on it can be torn off .
project H@@ ieve : details lie on the table
the plans for the holiday settlement at the Small Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor presented publicly plans for the project for the first time .
several An@@ gli@@ ders are still troubled - they fear the sale of their leisure facility
&quot; for months it was negotiated and deb@@ ated behind closed doors , deb@@ ated , deb@@ ated and drawn . &quot;
now the plans for a new holiday settlement at the Small Sea near Em@@ den are on the table .
&quot; the Inter@@ esting , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ der Company &quot; System Construction , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the Em@@ den Council &apos;s urban development committee . &quot;
&quot; originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda . &quot;
&quot; under pressure from the project critics and the F@@ DP faction , which accused the investor and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ en went on the offensive by the system construction management : &quot; we have not yet answered all the questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors . &quot;
but it is good to be able to meet all the rum@@ ors now .
&quot; for months , the project has been in discussion for about ten to twelve million euros . &quot;
violent reactions among marine owners who had come to the meeting called out the images and new details about the desired hotel building .
&quot; Roberto Schulz , owner of the sea and board member at the representation of An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; this is a giant cla@@ p that out@@ poses all the other buildings . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he fears as many other project critics that the traffic would increase strongly due to the planned size of the plant : &quot; there must be full bus loads , so that it pays off , &quot; says Schulz &quot;
&quot; what happens exactly on the area of the former restaurant , which is about a hect@@ are area , is still open . &quot;
there is no operator yet .
&quot; first we need to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ end . &quot;
&quot; because this was still lacking , the construction plans were still variable . &quot;
young talents at gor@@ illas in the Frankfurt Zoo
the Frankfurt zoo is looking forward to new offspring at its gor@@ illas .

Google starts dou@@ bling campaign to collect 11 million dollars for refugees
&quot; Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a dou@@ bling campaign aimed at bringing $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations , which will help thousands of refugees who have crossed the European nations as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries . &quot;
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to announ@@ cing the Don@@ ate call on his blog .
&quot; instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google associate , fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , about her personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; our journey included many dark railway and bus rides , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help . &quot;
&quot; donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing aid to refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
Google said that the first global funds raised up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com will be doubled to $ 11 million .
&quot; Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year . &quot;
&quot; many also fled from the Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya torn apart from the war . &quot;

weight loss surgery can be helpful for easily obes@@ e di@@ abe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes may last at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to tell if easily obes@@ e people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial to the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Surgery . &quot;
&quot; weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
&quot; over the years , obesity operations to treat type 2 diabetes have proven to be efficient , but most studies have been carried out in people who are path@@ ologically obes@@ e with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a measure of weight in terms of size , is regarded as normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24,@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ ese Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital recorded data they had collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity surgery - stomach b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c surgery - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily overweight . &quot;
the average BM@@ I of those undergoing this operation decreased from 31 to 24@@ ,5 to the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , BM@@ I remained with those who did not receive non @-@ surgical diabetes treatment approximately at 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who underwent surgery , 36 % of the di@@ ab@@ etic disease was completely dissolved and 28 % partially . &quot;
&quot; in the medi@@ cally treated group , diabetes was completely reduced by only one percent in comparison with the diabetes and , in some cases , only about two percent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol were generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out . &quot;
the researchers also monitored the patient blood level of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
&quot; ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , write the researchers . &quot;
&quot; after surgery , the average ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c dropped by around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not decrease mortality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also compared the average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ rec@@ tomy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reaching larger responses in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 % ) and recorded a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study does not show any survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are evidence from a study of more serious people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study it was in obes@@ e people who underwent obesity , about 29 per cent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was comfor@@ ting for individuals with a BM@@ I of 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because she says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have soli@@ di@@ fied their body with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ r√ºck
&quot; it is a topic that is currently attracting attention in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular and un@@ si@@ gh@@ tly at school times , meets the scar@@ city of her youth after years , and this falls in love with her . &quot;
so also in the recently published novel &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der .
&quot; beyond the love story , the novel is likely to be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ r√ºck readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages . &quot;
the full @-@ time writer grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she could put a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
it &apos;s impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; Europe could not take up all the refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East was lying . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist guide called for an end to violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom during his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford which is devoted to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the reaction of the West European countries to the refugee crisis was admir@@ able , but the situation was not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to tackle the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions like real peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; he stressed . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , we need to think about how killing is reduced in their countries . &quot;
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of violence never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and also commented George Bush &apos;s actions after the September 11 terrorist attack and revealed that the violent reaction of the United States drew a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my sympathy in a letter to President Bush , and I told him that the way to solving this problem lies in non@@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence , and that has caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
four@@ fold increase in the intake of disinf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the last 4 years
&quot; poison control centres in the US report an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of twelve , which swal@@ lows strongly alcoholic hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants , such as the Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenue of hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants in children under the age of 12 reported the poison control centres , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children increasingly come to these products and unfortunately a percentage of them land in the emergency room , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children deliberately drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants , while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in social media . &quot;
videos on YouTube show how young dis@@ infection agents drink only because of a cheap experience .
teenagers have allegedly mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants with alcoholic mou@@ th@@ wash to get a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
&quot; there is disinf@@ ect@@ ant with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent that are very appealing for children . &quot;
disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
&quot; especially for small children , a few sp@@ lashes can lead to alcohol intoxic@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Th@@ orn@@ ton , Medical Director of the poison control center at the Hospital of the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the transmitter Fox 4 in Can@@ sa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t let si@@ p whis@@ ky around , but people let this hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant reach within reach of children , and when children come to it , it &apos;s a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who had recently taken four sp@@ lashes from straw@@ berry fra@@ grant drugs in school , was brought to treatment in an emergency . &quot;
&quot; her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold , which is legally considered drunk by an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency medical practitioner who treated them at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah listened to her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency .
&quot; doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital for signs of brain trauma , as the girl fell by the alcohol and pushed the head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey . &quot;
&quot; that was very sc@@ ary , &quot; &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and to store disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
&quot; beyond alcohol intoxic@@ ation , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , two women died in Ontario women after swal@@ lowing disinf@@ ect@@ ants containing toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was listed as an active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students of the fourth grade in the New York State planned to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by putting anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; says a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to disinf@@ ect@@ ants and banned them from her room .
&quot; the police regarded the ne@@ sted plan as &quot; &quot; bab@@ bling &quot; , &quot; and referred to disciplinary action to the school authority . &quot;
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged
&quot; in case of a collision on the cross @-@ p@@ liers between Nor@@ dr@@ ing and Her@@ pes , a 33 @-@ year @-@ old car driver has been injured in a collision accident . &quot;
a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver travelled to the industrial area on the cross @-@ p@@ liers and realized too late that two forward @-@ driving cars had stopped at the roundabout .
&quot; as a result , he crashed his truck into the rear of an audi@@ torium and pushed this vehicle onto a Ford Fi@@ esta . &quot;
&quot; at the accident involved vehicles , material damage was about 10,000 euros , the police reported . &quot;
the Audi of the 33 @-@ year @-@ old was no longer ready and had to be tow@@ ed .

&quot; Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ stein in the first half @-@ season gave Aber@@ deen a tight victory over Hamilton in Pit@@ to@@ dri@@ e , so that the D@@ ons create a five @-@ point gap between themselves and Celtic . &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths playing talk about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y
&quot; there are ru@@ mo@@ urs about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic Glasgow , which was spontaneously rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths . he insi@@ sted that he and his team mates did not stand under increased control , as they prepare themselves for confrontation with the Dutch table leader . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think that the players are looking forward to it . &quot;
lack of title competition in Scottish football boring Dut@@ ch@@ man - de Bo@@ er
&quot; former R@@ angers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , there is no title rival@@ ry with the R@@ angers . &quot;
&quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; in Holland they are not showing off the highlights of the Celtic games anymore and why ? &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here speak not only about the return of the R@@ angers .
they talk about Old Firm .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
&quot; there is a lot of tension in the old @-@ style games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games . &quot;
&quot; I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la . &quot;
&quot; Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la accepted that Celtic has to fight , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things around . &quot;
&quot; after the defeat against Malm@@ √∂ and the subsequent departure from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , which is now at the top of the table with five points ahead . &quot;
&quot; Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens . &quot;
we feel it exactly like that - but we have to go on .
&quot; we really need the support of Celtic , because that makes the players better . &quot;
standing together is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton carefully in January transfers
&quot; despite his comments , just a few weeks ago , indicating that he p@@ itted some January transfers , R@@ angers @-@ boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is cau@@ tious when signing new arri@@ vals and insi@@ sts that he does not want to distur@@ b the unity of the I@@ bro@@ x @-@ Ka@@ der . &quot;
&quot; the ex @-@ chief of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; the January Transfer Window is very different from the summer window . &quot;
players coming in the summer have this pre @-@ season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .

&quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; there is no team that has won everything , in tro@@ phy games or le@@ agues that won &apos;t win the games of this kind . &quot;
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the UK it increases overall . &quot;
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 while the number of people without labor for the United Kingdom rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was above that of the U@@ K@@ s of 5.5 percent , as the numbers of the Bureau for National Statistics ( ON@@ S ) showed . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12.@@ 000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland decreased to 7@@ 4.0 per cent - a number above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; in these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decrease in unemployment . &quot;

why I will witness an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
&quot; somewhat later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death . &quot;
&quot; when it happens , and I hope that it does not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison inj@@ ector . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
&quot; the invitation already took place for the first time in January with his best friend , and even though I was shocked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; as the day drew closer , I began to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
&quot; I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists can see directions in the USA , and as often more applications are available as places , a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery is taking place to decide who is elected . &quot;
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
those who are selected will emotion@@ less observe it .
I can &apos;t do that .
&quot; I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps closest friend , with whom I developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hours visit . &quot;
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so I won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and pen to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality on Twitter .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner as he wants it and you get access .
I compla@@ ined to her .
&quot; she admitted that she could &quot; &quot; have better form@@ ulate &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot;
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to be present to write there .
&quot; when he dies , he thinks that the public relations of the movement will help the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts I made . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go back to all the details here .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of the act .
but I believe there is a strong chance that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man dying of unnecessary death .
man after wet police ch@@ ase persu@@ aded to come out of the Cann@@ ing River
the Cann@@ ing V@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry when he talked to the man of the Cann@@ ing River .
&quot; an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to impose the police was un@@ successful when he was in the shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , only a few meters away from a police officer who tried to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of Cann@@ ing V@@ ale was sum@@ mon@@ ed to a house peace incident in Bas@@ ham on Tuesday .
&quot; when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them towards Cann@@ ing River . &quot;
but he didn &apos;t come too far .
&quot; he stood in the water and said &apos; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman negoti@@ ates . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
&quot; in 2006 , C@@ ous@@ ins drove his car in the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim across the S@@ wan River . &quot;
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspired locals to the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ in bi@@ athlon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and thre@@ aten to end racing
&quot; Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year , threatening to finish the race immediately . &quot;
&quot; he pointed to the ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they conducted a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; M@@ oo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it came to the positive cob@@ alt tone test at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain . &quot;
he had kept back 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ onage alleg@@ ations and did not want it to &quot; look like too high hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it and I sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot;
they know that it continued .
&quot; sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said . &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I want to walk around the head , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them . &quot;
&quot; if you start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I shouldn &apos;t be more trainer . &quot;
I have to think about what I do with my license .
M@@ oo@@ dy had previously uploaded the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com that the integrity department had tried to spy out his stable .
&quot; eigh@@ teen months Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I am going to name when I &apos;m asked - and offered him an occupation in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on Rac@@ ing@@ .com . &quot;
they seem to believe that I am a che@@ ater .
&quot; if that is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses because they failed to hold me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of the time and are still today . &quot;
should this bring me to the conclusion that it becomes personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L behave cow@@ ard@@ ly and perhaps makes people outside of trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe the people out there that I am .
&quot; maybe they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say they can think about it now . &quot;
&quot; but now I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad . &quot;
this really makes me sad .
I will put pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the train@@ ee &apos;s fru@@ stration levels have built up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt investigation into Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led to the fact that he could &quot; &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ defeated master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race @-@ day treatment as &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a pack had been applied mud or clay to the horse strip , which viol@@ ated the rules . &quot;
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my collabor@@ ators has mistakenly applied mud on the leg .
it could have been so yesterday evening .
&quot; it could have been like yesterday all day , which was so . &quot;
but it was also on the race day .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the pack on the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules do not know about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here we went too far , &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot;
man arrested after driver &apos;s flight
&quot; on the weekend , the police arrested a man after a collision with a cycl@@ ist and subsequent driver flight in Cob@@ ram . &quot;
the cycl@@ ist was delivered with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on Saturday morning at the Mur@@ ray Valley Highway .
the police said the driver continued driving without stopping to help the injured driver .
&quot; on Monday , a 50 @-@ year @-@ old man from N@@ ath@@ alia joined the police in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on . &quot;
&quot; it is expected to be charged with drivers &quot; flight and assistance , and due to other traffic off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; the cycl@@ ist , a 40 @-@ year old man from Cob@@ ram , remains in hospital . he is in a stable state . &quot;
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy res@@ ig@@ ns against ri@@ vals for claims to ring struggles
&quot; Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has described criticism of the Tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; &quot; of two Premier League favor@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L . &quot;
Sydney R@@ oo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ees allowed the Storm players &quot; ring matches &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in Sydney on Friday night .
&quot; Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos Trainer Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett made a scar@@ cely concealed remark to the Storm team after his team had reached the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; &quot; sample example &quot; &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in rings . &quot;
Bell@@ amy defended the fli@@ ck@@ ery of his team and said that they were only concentrating on their &quot; contact . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy added that the cri@@ tique of two leading trainers in his team gave him confidence , because they were worried that they were worried to be beaten by the Storm team . &quot;
&quot; that happens again and again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about ring fights as they beat us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that we have changed nothing in our defensive system or techniques throughout the year . however , in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ tics a real focal point , and that has made the turn@@ around for us . &quot;
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to train . he is probably not accustomed to losing it so it was a bit of a shock for him .
it is funny how this time always appears at this time of the year .
&quot; Bell@@ amy had attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; football . &quot;
Wa@@ yne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; he compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday night and how exciting it was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 , St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said he &apos;ll take care of it . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and which we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t so they can play like these . &quot;
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us .
six weeks ago they did not think of us when it was about the big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters made a higher result than the match Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more trials in our game , but is that an exciting game ? &quot;
&quot; or are breaks , and no points something exciting ? &quot;
for me it is the game plans .
&quot; when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in one phase . &quot;
the Storm team released this weekend because they won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks next Saturday night at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
&quot; Ser@@ bi@@ ans with 200,000 $ deposit on drug sanctions &quot;
&quot; a man who could possibly suffer a life @-@ long punishment due to his attempt to get possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and placed in Co@@ om@@ era in August . &quot;
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants in the marina during the morning and later in the Caf√© Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
&quot; despite a potentially life sentence for attempting to possess a commercial quantity of co@@ ca@@ ine , the attorney from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole lot and that in the caf√© could have been a harmless cause . &quot;
&quot; the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was worried about the danger of flight at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; he explained to the court on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in case of punishment , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of $ 200,000 for security in order to achieve his release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the official declarations of the two persons , it is clear that the circulation of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ agan . &quot;
&quot; but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against deposit , under the conditions that he ab@@ dic@@ ates his Australian and his Ser@@ b passport , which he reports daily at the police and is holding an exit from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;
accident at A@@ 5 near Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab apart
&quot; in case of a collision with three trucks on the highway 5 at Karlsruhe , a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening . &quot;
two of the three trucks involved had bra@@ ked in the direction of Basel in front of a permanent construction site .
&quot; the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to turn left at the last moment , as the police announced . &quot;
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident @-@ caus@@ er tore apart completely .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed for six hours until 2 o &apos;clock .
&quot; there was a loss of 12@@ 2,000 euros . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone from girls to l@@ ure pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es to send pictures
a pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le used the phone of a 11 year old girl to demand pictures of child abuse .
&quot; St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the girl &apos;s phone when he was asleep , logged into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a series of un@@ decent images of children sent to him by another user . &quot;
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of sleeping H@@ og@@ g .
she saw it through and found the conf@@ using messages and immediately al@@ armed her mother .
&quot; the police took care of it and looked at the five images , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; related &quot; web searches , which used terms for searching for in@@ decent images of children . &quot;
&quot; H@@ og@@ g then claimed to the officials that he had done it , as it would lead to &quot; pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es on the Internet , &quot; and he then &quot; preten@@ ded to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on said to the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; he said it would be a addiction - that he was addic@@ ted to frigh@@ ten people . &quot;
&quot; he admitted that the searches were carried out on the computer by him , but he said it was , because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are ped@@ ophil@@ es . &quot;
he was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and which he asked to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure them .
&quot; he said he was sick in his head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder . &quot;
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was trem@@ bling and crying .
she also saw the in@@ decent images on the phone and confronted the accused with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused used computers and pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk with girls who looked much younger than he .
&quot; H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to the indictment , to have in@@ decent images of children on 14 June last year , to have viol@@ ated the court on 25 January and did not appear before the court on 24 March of this year . &quot;
&quot; defence lawyer Gregor S@@ im requested that H@@ og@@ g does not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , since one could argue that &quot; &quot; no substantial sexual element &quot; &quot; is found in its off@@ ence . &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff A@@ list@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the verdict until October to receive background reports on social work .
&quot; H@@ og@@ g was granted a deposit in this case , but was held in custody for hear@@ ings to other pending cases . &quot;
he was taken up before the date of judgment into the list of sexual offen@@ ders .
smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers switch to Germany on small border cross@@ ings
more and more refugees are being taken up outside the major control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers left people on smaller border cross@@ ings for fear of discovery and arrest
&quot; on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said . &quot;
&quot; since Tuesday , more than 1,000 refugees have been taken up along the Inn River Inn in the coun@@ ties of Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn . &quot;
they were on foot over bridges and shr@@ ub@@ s to the German side .
there they are received by federal police officers and forwarded to the registration .
&quot; in the Munich Central Station , more refugees once more met after federal police statements in comparison to the start of the week on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; about 700 people arrived in the capital city alone until 8 : 00 , said a speaker in the morning . &quot;
&quot; after the re @-@ introduction of controls at the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city . &quot;
&quot; Stuttgart : for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; in the southwest is expected &quot;
meteor@@ ologists warn of pet@@ ers in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
&quot; due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , warm sea air currently flows into the country , divided the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart . &quot;
&quot; the powerful low is the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; Henry , &quot; who has moved from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic in the past few days . &quot;
heavy storms and thunder@@ storms are mainly expected in Baden .
&quot; according to DW@@ D , still in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the Boden@@ se@@ abed with gu@@ sts of 60 to 90 km . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the sun can be seen again . &quot;
the mass makes it : every two years the car makers at the IAA show their novel@@ ties .
&quot; in 2015 , it is mainly moving to compact cars that are currently selling very well . &quot;
cars from the compact class are currently in particular demand : about 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations accounted for this segment in August alone in August alone .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( public days 17th to 27th of September ) .
&quot; this year , many new compact models will be introduced between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars and luxury cars . &quot;
&quot; one of the greatest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be at deal@@ er@@ ships in autumn . &quot;
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; R√ºssel@@ sheim . Opel presents a entry below the biggest competitor VW Golf , which starts at 17 650 euros . &quot;
the current Astra will cost from ‚Ç¨ 16 9@@ 90 .
the Astra is powered by a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , the Hessen also offers further diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for the first time also three @-@ cylinder petrol engines . &quot;
&quot; unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is initially only five @-@ door . &quot;
&quot; the second variant will follow in the spring of the station wagon , which can also be seen at the IAA . &quot;
and what will happen next to the Astra at the IAA yet on new compact cars ?
Renault M√©@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competitors M√©@@ gan@@ e to the race .
&quot; at the fair , the M√©@@ gan@@ e is to be seen exclusively as a fifth @-@ door in a conventional and an under@@ lined sport GT version . &quot;
&quot; in the trade it comes from the beginning of next year , then as a comb@@ i . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan sub@@ station wants to find its position in the rapidly growing segment with the new model .
&quot; with its curved lines , the compact Infin@@ iti fits perfectly into the brand &apos;s design line . &quot;
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the range also includes a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
&quot; the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter tur@@ bo@@ charged engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 HP . &quot;
&quot; according to manufacturer &apos;s data , the maximum torque is 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) . &quot;
sales start of the bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
&quot; Ds 4 : not quite new , but completely renewed is the compact class DS 4 , which can be seen at the IAA . &quot;
&quot; on the outside , the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ √´@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ger presented above all hands on the front panel : the radiator gri@@ lle was re@@ drawn and the modified head@@ lights were equipped with LED technology . &quot;
&quot; in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ainment system was moderni@@ zed , reducing the number of buttons by a touch screen and integrated Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play for the first time . &quot;
&quot; in addition , at the IAA in the compact class , there are a number of re@@ visions and new variants such as the upgraded Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI . &quot;
J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are un@@ worthy
&quot; the Federal Constitutional Court gave a right to an ex @-@ prisoner of the Te@@ gel Justice , who was lod@@ ged in a small cell for months . &quot;
&quot; because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are generally entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells . &quot;
this was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision issued on Wednesday .
&quot; according to the judges , the judges may even hope for money if they were confined within confined spaces only a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe was successful : he was placed in a single cell with approximately five square metres of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was not separated spati@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man who , according to his lawyer , is now on the free foot , has been transferred to a larger cell . &quot;
his term of office because of the un@@ worthy conditions of detention against the Land of Berlin failed .
&quot; however , the judges took up the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ al and re@@ mitted the case to the re @-@ examination . &quot;
they see the man &apos;s human dignity viol@@ ated .
chamber Court now decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; although for legal reasons , only a few days of arrest for compensation were decisive for legal reasons , there was a compensation for compensation . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; a cur@@ v@@ ature of the legal protection of the personality would be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Court of Appe@@ al must now clarify the amount of damage compensation .
&quot; in the past , the judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they only spoke to a prisoner in April , because he was imprisoned naked in a cell . &quot;
&quot; according to a Dec@@ ision of 2011 , human dignity is also the multiple assignment of a cell without separate toilet . &quot;
&quot; in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had agreed a decent housing for a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 . &quot;
the then pla@@ inti@@ ff was lod@@ ged every day between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell like in the Karlsruhe case .
&quot; in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons have also come to the head@@ lines due to lack of personnel . &quot;
&quot; prisoners are therefore always included 23 hours , which increases aggres@@ si@@ veness , even to massac@@ res must have come because of the ten@@ se situation . &quot;
&quot; according to the judicial press agency , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied for young people , 19 will fall away in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; we are creating this &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept them .
what is coming to Germany ?
&quot; according to predic@@ tions by Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , some 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year , according to the testimony of Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is able to take up a million refugees . &quot;
&quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do this , and we can do it . &quot;
&quot; what is coming to Germany , gives the following overview . &quot;
&quot; according to different progn@@ oses between 350@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry of the Federal Ministry ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments annually - and the next five years . &quot;
&quot; this is almost twice as much as it has been built so far ( 250@@ ,000 dwell@@ ings ) . &quot;
&quot; the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all with affordable rental properties : 60,000 to 80@@ ,000 social housing from the rental price are falling annually , and these particularly favourable apartments will also apply for refugees . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the promotion , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; what is too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing would have to arise annually , and therefore the federal government should invest EUR 6.@@ 4 billion a year . &quot;
scientists and federal mini@@ stries agree that there must also be more tax benefits for housing construction .
&quot; according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , 55 per cent of the poultry in Germany can be employed in the long term . &quot;
&quot; however , the refugees in Germany were not systematically asked about their qualifications to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot;
&quot; for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial that they find work in Germany . &quot;
&quot; labour is the key for social contacts , for the appreciation in the reception company , but also for the self @-@ esteem of the immigrants , says Migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ es@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , according to the throne , there has been a political change : from the prohibition of employment for refugees to recognise work . &quot;
&quot; while there was previously a ban on employment for asylum seekers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the duty of residence to limit asylum seekers to a residential place . &quot;
&quot; in society , even because of the shortage of skilled workers , there has been a majority of view that refugees should be allowed to access the labour market more quickly . &quot;
a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is lacking German knowledge .
&quot; until now , there is no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses . &quot;
studies also show that jobs are most often communicated through personal contacts .
&quot; therefore , the structure of networks is , according to Thr@@ es@@ hardt , the K√∂nigs@@ weg for the Integration of Work . &quot;
&quot; the Berlin school administration has found that only a few fled parents give their children to the kit@@ es , estimated to be ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the ent@@ ro@@ uted parents it is only once very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ schem@@ bar , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; to convince the family nevertheless of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages . &quot;
&quot; if the demand for educ@@ ators rise strongly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacities - for instance by allowing more specialist schools . &quot;
&quot; in the countries , students without knowledge of German will be prepared in welcome classes . &quot;
&quot; however , they are not always taught by trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers , who have only one qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ offer of the school administration in Berlin . &quot;
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
&quot; in principle no Bundes@@ land asylum seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception was Berlin , In@@ sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned his attitude . &quot;
willing refugees could be facilit@@ ated access to the university .
&quot; for refugees with a reimbur@@ sement of residence or toler@@ ation do not receive any services after the asylum seek@@ er law more , if they begin a study . &quot;
&quot; the latter generally do not receive a bean oil , as they do not fall under the circle of the members of the board . &quot;
&quot; tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years so far in order to be entitled to B@@ af@@ √∂@@ g , from 1 January 2016 to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; however , this financing gap must also be closed , demand Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk . &quot;
the students should immediately get b@@ af@@ √∂@@ g .
&quot; Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should gradually enter the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and the existing state church law will continue to develop into a new state of religion . &quot;
it would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare organization who takes care of the newcom@@ ers professionally .
the rights also include obligations .
&quot; in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to work with the state in many areas and to grant him some control options . &quot;
this also includes the willingness to take heed to religious fundament@@ alism .
&quot; the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried in to Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to take such conflicts in Germany immediately &quot; have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot;
he proposed transl@@ ating the Basic Law in Arabic .
&quot; in the future , integration will be much more than today a topic of the whole society . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the majority society will have to change , the reduction of discrimination and racism is more pressing . &quot;
&quot; although Germany has , as a result of European decisions , has been an anti @-@ discrimination policy and a general equality law since a decade . &quot;
&quot; but it learns very slowly , as the NS@@ U @-@ series showed , in the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive . &quot;
&quot; equal opportunities for all : what migrant organisations and the interests of non @-@ white Germans have long been calling for and which international agreements like the anti @-@ racism con@@ ges@@ tion of Germany are committed must become reality in the next few years , if the country is peaceful and its new citizens should use their possibilities - for the good of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany is able to provide medical care to the previously expected refugees , writes Doctor Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; as for man@@ - power and capacities , we create that , &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , additional money must flow into the system . &quot;
&quot; to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery demands to susp@@ end all newcom@@ ers equally when registering health cards . &quot;
services rendered could be expected later with the federal states .
&quot; and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to collect as many people with the limited catalogue of services that the asylum seekers bill fores@@ ees . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the doctors make especially the language barriers . &quot;
&quot; so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are getting worse about their diseases than other patients . &quot;
&quot; interpreting costs would need to be taken over not only in hospitals , also in medical practices . &quot;
&quot; however , many refugees were also helped with more general medical points of contact in the ambul@@ ances . &quot;
and with another diagnostic view .
&quot; among refugee children there are clearly more un@@ treated disabilities , and with the young people it is about HIV awareness . &quot;
&quot; with the partial rest of the disease , German doctors come from their education , but clearly , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery means . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to recognise . &quot; &quot; and as for the shortage of doctors , the refugees may even have a relief in sight . &quot;
&quot; Syrians would have a highly developed education system , some refugees are even doctors . &quot;
&quot; in order to be allowed to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take ex@@ ams again . &quot;
&quot; at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill after estimates by the Federal Psych@@ otherap@@ ist Chamber ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) , most suffer from post@@ traum@@ atic stress disorder or depression . &quot;
&quot; refugee children are particularly vulnerable , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recently published study by the TU Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee camp is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
&quot; those who suffer from a post traum@@ atic stress disorder , among other things , suffer from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and death . &quot;
&quot; further symptoms are sleeping and concentration problems , strong timi@@ dity and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; to prevent the symptoms being chronic , early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z explained . &quot;
&quot; up to now , however , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees receive psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; although psych@@ ologically ill asylum seekers in the Social Wel@@ fare can ask for a psych@@ otherapy application , the treatment usually lasts for several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the social @-@ offices mostly non @-@ skilled workers or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses will decide whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; with the new production &quot; Passion , &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus arts . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to attract every age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment . &quot;
now the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to dream in the man@@ ege on a brick .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , animal trainer and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; passion &quot; - under this motto is the current stage staging .
&quot; for more than 33 years , the Circus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; thus , the family is in the blood . &quot;
&quot; it is important to us to take the people away from their everyday lives and take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; emphasizes the 27 @-@ year @-@ old junior . &quot;
&quot; man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with cosm@@ opolitan flair , &quot; Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst calls his concept . &quot;
&quot; 50 cities on the nearly 3,000 km long tour can now experience this flair . &quot;
the cir@@ cus programme convin@@ ces by talented artists from around the world .
&quot; excellent at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the audience with wit and charm . &quot;
the Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .
&quot; with the heroes of the silent movies , the Cuban du@@ et wants to loose . &quot;
&quot; light@@ ness and ag@@ ility - with these words , they identify themselves . &quot;
her humor@@ ous art at the mast is meant to conquer women &apos;s hearts by storm .
&quot; besides numerous salmon @-@ sal@@ ts , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with intuition and arti@@ cle@@ ety . &quot;
to balance with the un@@ ic@@ ycle on a ball ?
for He Yu@@ an no problem .
snake @-@ men fascin@@ ate and sc@@ are at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics like little others and fascin@@ ates with her mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; says Steph@@ an@@ ies &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ c@@ uses are often the subject of various animal welfare organizations .
&quot; Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst also takes a stand : &quot; &quot; if it is not good for our animals , we are not doing well . &quot;
approximately 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every pet@@ ting unit .
&quot; the &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes &quot; as they are called lovingly , will be read by the eyes of every wish . &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
&quot; if the animal does not feel comfortable , it does not want to get into the man@@ ege . &quot;
the top priority : care for the animals .
&quot; especially on her zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud . &quot;
the two animals lived together eight years in an enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; the zeb@@ roid isn &apos;t ready for the man@@ ege , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst . &quot;
so there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or one 200 viewers , we always do our best and with all my heart . &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst invites every day from 17 to 20 September at 17 : 00 and 20 : 00 pm .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
&quot; Thursday is family day , for the performance at 5 pm the prices are dis@@ counted . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm . &quot;
Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe holds false speech in parliament
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest guide , fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread across the social media . &quot;
&quot; the opening of the parliament was also clou@@ ded by asser@@ tions by de@@ pu@@ ties of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats , and warned them of accompanying the Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address with bu@@ zz@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; in the last month , they had ple@@ dged him and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the speaker of the Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven op@@ positions politicians received SMS messages on their phones , which they warned against disturbing Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address . &quot;
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , he said to journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot;
it warns the members of the Parliament that immunity will end in Parliament and as soon as they leave parliament their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective .
the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; concerned &quot; about the dangers for politicians .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will reduce up to 30.000 jobs
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services . &quot;
&quot; later this year , HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing corporate hardware and service activities . &quot;
&quot; expected job cuts lead to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , &quot; said HP in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP president and Chief Executive , who should lead the unit after separation . &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise becomes smaller and more focused than it is today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that help companies transition to a new style of business , &quot; &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot;
&quot; as a stand @-@ alone company , we are better positioned than ever to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world . &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on providing previously un@@ at@@ tain@@ able , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; said the company . &quot;
it spl@@ its a company that was founded in the 1930s by graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to produce electrical systems and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage is called &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to handle the aband@@ on@@ ment of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this field based on the conviction that closely focused companies deliver better performance . &quot;
FC Arsenal @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates must stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; Wen@@ ger emphasized against Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was not until September , and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play back before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optim@@ ism scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of his history his participation in the European Championship will certainly be uncertain . &quot;
the big shame in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing back during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it is a bone that did not heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was only an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kles or with the injuries he had before .
&quot; this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
Prime Inj@@ uries Ltd &apos;s investigation lists 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since its debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Arsen@@ als 157 League games in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for Arsenal is that in six out of eight seasons they have been one of the two Premier League Clubs since 2007 / 08 .
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsenal believes that an improvement will last during the injury rate during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a prone period , a time in which you need to strengthen your body and gain fighting power , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves . &quot;
&quot; Arsenal ki@@ cks off his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger introduces a rotation inside the team . &quot;
&quot; H@@ √©@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ √≠n and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not traveled to Croatia , which means that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are expected to start . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and give players who need it to get a little break @-@ off &quot; , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; although Arsenal &apos;s clear favor@@ ites are to continue by group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the largest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe . &quot;
&quot; dynam@@ o is unbe@@ aten after 41 games , after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign started last season . &quot;
&quot; the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , whereby the Richter scale was measured 3.2 . &quot;
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; Wen@@ ger believes that arsen@@ al has drawn the lesson from last season with the Champions League surrender to Monaco and remains driven by the far hope , with its management to lead the club to its first European cup victory . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it has never worked in the arsen@@ al .
&quot; we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers . &quot;
friendship Fest : the comedy show giving us serious lessons about male friend@@ ships
&quot; the lack of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up , now even more desperate than ever before , how suicide rates among young men prove on a 15 @-@ year high . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to tackle the problem , the Campa@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - campaign against her@@ edi@@ tary life ) was announced in 2015 as the year of the man , with the aim of asking the men to seek help if they need them . &quot;
friendship is the heart of the struggle for master@@ ing this challenge .
&quot; a recent study with more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms noted that when the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ved the risks of mental problems . &quot;
&quot; but of course , you have to have friends first , so that a friendship can work . &quot;
&quot; in the age of communication led by social media , with its emphasis on style over substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , li@@ ke@@ able and successful , even if in reality the isolation dominates . &quot;
&quot; this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic value ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intr@@ insi@@ cally values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper . &quot;
&quot; and as a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy happiness . &quot;
the Beau@@ tiful with Friends was that this focuss@@ ing was put on the head .
&quot; each character has not been defined by his work , but by his personality , which shines through interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments in football sessions in cozy chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all that came out of the knowledge that men can relate to it , even if they often with@@ hold themselves completely to explore their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as a member of the telephone crew , I explained : &quot; &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and self @-@ murder has clearly shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often don &apos;t feel able to talk with friends .
&quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; I get along with it &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , such as feeling that it is perceived as a weakness , when talking openly about problems . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the little moments of male friend@@ ships .
&quot; so much my objective out@@ si@@ ders status over the telephone people may also help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so if you visit this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with which to celebrate the day completely re@@ designed scenery , why do not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k with . &quot;
&quot; or , even better , if you see someone sitting alone in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say h@@ ello . &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship might make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the total 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malm@@ √∂
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hits against Malm@@ √∂ .
&quot; at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday , di Maria will meet and help PS@@ G to pass by Malm@@ √∂ . &quot;
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held the course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main launched the Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ √∂ in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ sta@@ dion on Tuesday .
&quot; di Maria met less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player who brought the French master to the way , but thereafter she missed a number of occasions before she finally raised her lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head ball in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish master , as they do not only aim for the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds but an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , it was not a classic game by Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later changed in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the club with whom he began his illustri@@ ous career back in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , to cause our opponents problems and look back , even if there are certain things we need to perfect over the season , &quot; &quot; Blanc said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good omen . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we haven &apos;t scored one or two more goals . &quot;
&quot; after his injury , I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to the Paris team after his injury , which in the weekend could hold a 2 : 2 tie at his own place against Bordeaux in the First Division , but he was ej@@ ected by Di Maria in the fourth minute . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing @-@ stor@@ mer was called the man who could take PS@@ G to the next level in Europe when he was taken over in the last month of Manchester United , and he indicated why , when he went in to Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis pass behind the Malm@@ √∂ defense before he finished in the long corner of the grid at Johan Wil@@ and . &quot;
&quot; however , if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , it was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malm@@ √∂ , which hit Celtic in a play @-@ off to achieve this level , joined the field with nine national players and was lined up with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field a heavy opponent . &quot;
&quot; but apart from a shot by Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps pole in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G sometimes gave himself up , with some mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ements and bad connections , not least from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was scrat@@ ched in the first half alone and then abandoned after cav@@ ani had used it after re@@ bo@@ oting . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he proved a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players into play , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which Di Maria transformed into a shooting shot by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the pole ... &quot;
the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an achieved his sixth seasonal gate after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had refres@@ hed a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
&quot; that ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ √∂ could return to the game , and only an excellent intervention by Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz was able to keep the end result low before replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi finished a gate at the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Malm@@ √∂ , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class over his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December . &quot;
since then we have only played in the Swedish league which has not the same level .
the qualifying matches are not enough . &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ en@@ core collects 2.5 billion dollars through share purchase
&quot; the mining giant Gl@@ en@@ core , which is located in Switzerland , is affected by collap@@ sing commodity prices , collected 2.5 billion $ on Wednesday through a stock sale as part of its huge debt recovery plan . &quot;
&quot; the company Gl@@ en@@ core registered in London said in a statement that it sold new shares worth about EUR 1.6 billion , in order to pay off its own debts . &quot;
&quot; the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year , fights with falling commodity prices , as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn pus@@ hes demand and has a devastating effect on markets . &quot;
&quot; at the early Wednesday morning , the issue of reference rights brought a rapid rise to the top of the London stock exchange . &quot;
&quot; the share jumped by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 P@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher . &quot;
&quot; last week , Gl@@ en@@ core had announced the $ 2.5 billion share sale as part of the more comprehensive plans to wipe about a third of his $ 30 billion debt . &quot;
&quot; the company sold the new shar@@ ehol@@ dings to 125 P@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday . &quot;
there were 1.3 billion shares in the value of up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the Group .
&quot; concerns regarding long @-@ term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other commodity prices have declined by 20 to 40 percent . &quot;

white House confirms Xi Jin@@ ping &apos;s visit to Washington
&quot; Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping will make a state visit to the US at the end of the month , confirming the White House in an explanation on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the visit , the first official in Washington , takes place on 25 September and responds by President Barack Obama &apos;s trip to Beijing last November , said the statement . &quot;

&quot; XI , first announced in February , is expected to hit several U.S. technology leaders in Seattle on their way to Washington before travelling to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Obama and Xi address a number of controversial issues , including Washington &apos;s concerns regarding China &apos;s alleged cy@@ ber sp@@ ying and its increasing self @-@ confidence in the controversial waters of the South China Sea . &quot;

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 transition to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
&quot; the FC Bayern was obviously a few years ago just ahead of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who played for FC Barcelona at that time . &quot;
&quot; eight times Spanish champion , three times cup winners , four times champion league winner , two times champion league champion , two times champion champion , one time world champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking . &quot;
&quot; in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and switched to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar . &quot;
&quot; but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i tells now that he stood before the departure from Barcelona before the Euro 2008 . &quot;
one told me that Bar@@ √ßa had to sell me .
&quot; Madrid then won everything , we don &apos;t , &quot; he says . &quot;
and the registered also the FC Bayern .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted me to have me . &quot;
&quot; in the summer of 2008 , J√ºrgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern . &quot;
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i didn &apos;t change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this work today for the German record master : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; Bar@@ √ßa has taken Guardi@@ ola and I have played a great EM . &quot;
PE@@ P told me that I would not change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the team without me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what he has got me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ erns started playing time 2008 / 2009 with X@@ av@@ i .
&quot; X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bav@@ arians across the entire distance on the grass , switched the reds ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the king &apos;s victory triumph at the end . &quot;
matt Dam@@ on plays variety in film creation
matt Dam@@ on confronted the African film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on the diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
&quot; during a succession of Sunday Night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , experienced actor Brown interrupted the need for alternative perspectives , while referring to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project . &quot;
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it with the occupation of the film and not during the occupation of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot;
&quot; brown re@@ acted shocked , with offen@@ ded un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian had soli@@ di@@ fied . &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to ask people to think about it - whoever will be the director - how they treat the figure of the Harmony , &quot; Brown first said . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a mare , beaten by her white p@@ im@@ p . &quot;
the producer of Dear White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for directing rights to the film . Dam@@ on replied that her direction &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want .
&quot; after the discussion was broadcast , the Social Media explo@@ ded before dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments . &quot;
&quot; Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni squee@@ zed his anger over the clip , writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO KNO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the twe@@ et earned more than 5,000 re@@ twe@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its release . &quot;
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the head of social discussion .
&quot; after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white polic@@ eman , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement achieved a nationwide impact and urged leg@@ is@@ lators and authorities to stop discrimin@@ atory practices against colour content . &quot;
&quot; in February , the singer Prince made an all@@ usion to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards . &quot;
&quot; albums still matter , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot;
&quot; like books and black life , albums still have their meaning . &quot;
&quot; in recent times , leaders of the Movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter have published an explanation , namely reaction to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a group of hate . &quot;
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot;
&quot; recently , it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crowned First Champion
professional sports climbing and guidance Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete who won the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; the competition show , which just completed its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who finished all stages of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season finale there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , until the finale . &quot;
&quot; for the last task , climbing on a 75 foot @-@ long climbing rope belonged to 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time with which he was the first ath@@ lete to complete the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke to E ! news after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 million . &quot;
&quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or had life , &quot; Isaac e said ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot;
so suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the director , K@@ ent We@@ ed , sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the finale and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , did not receive any prize money . &quot;
&quot; according to the rules , the money goes to the fastest person . &quot;
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; how much money is a wonderful price and changes life , it receives the great rati@@ fication . &quot;
I don &apos;t think he won any gru@@ dge about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; If I should be struck by someone , then I am glad that it is Isaac . &quot;
and I think Isaac felt as if they had changed the roles .
&quot; America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or was extended for an eighth season , the shooting will start in spring 2016 . &quot;
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers are on the last place in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers have been reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but on Tuesday played perfectly against Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field . &quot;
the tw@@ ins wasted a chance to climb up in a half of the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League wild@@ card .
&quot; for Detroit , albeit only for an evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word that was so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all victories are fun no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers manager Brad Aus@@ m . &quot;
&quot; tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support , when Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in sixth and then once again in ninth place . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck 6 times in the 1 / 3 cour@@ ings and made three races possible .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to quit this year strongly , &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw in the bull@@ pen every game , and so I want to go all concentrated in the game . &quot;
&quot; the designed tiger hit Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August . &quot;
it was the first three @-@ hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle Navy on 6 July .
&quot; he sw@@ ung his sleep well , &quot; &quot; said Aus@@ m . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at the ( punch training ) , looked clearly better at the bull@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three R@@ uns in the back@@ yard at the end of the seventh session , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to the game . &quot;
centre Fiel@@ der B@@ yr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ ds Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
&quot; Har@@ dy over@@ ran the wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , before the designated R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who had a two @-@ run escape from the righ@@ th@@ anded Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of runners and the closing @-@ run on the second , Ver@@ hagen directly brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a Double Play . &quot;
it was the 27th time in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe struck a double play
&quot; after Detroit added a Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth downtown , Wall created an R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; however , the right @-@ handed one stab@@ bed S@@ ano at three Pit@@ ches for his fifth save . &quot;
Detroit at the start of the game benefited from a still non @-@ mo@@ ve@@ able Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers scored three rounds in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been deleted before the game from the vulner@@ ability list after having been missing more than a month because of a back pain .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for , &quot; &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches because in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first place , Hus@@ hai gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler . &quot;
a Two Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought to the game Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z who made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; in the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z achieved his 0 @-@ 21 successful series with the Run@@ ners in the scor@@ ing position .
&quot; the third bass player Nick Castell@@ anos followed a single on the right side , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to reach the third , which ended the threat . &quot;
&quot; on the second , the Tig@@ ers scored a One @-@ Out Double from Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two Out Single from Center @-@ Fiel@@ ds Anthony GO@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; that was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he did not beat well , but he got the right place . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the rel@@ ever right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter . &quot;
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four stri@@ ke@@ outs .
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired because of an injury to the throwing shoulder .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the shoulder of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 .
&quot; San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list because of a shoulder @-@ breaking , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with San@@ che@@ z out of the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris is cancelled from the vulner@@ ability list to fight against the T@@ wins . &quot;
&quot; Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers , since he was purchased in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30th &quot;
he has been missing in the right hip since the 20th of August .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will end their series of three games at the Target Field on Wednesday
&quot; Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 ) &quot;
hundreds of refugees are supposed to perish in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; the people anger@@ ed in it should then be accommodated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the city of Wiesbaden exc@@ laimed on Tuesday evening . &quot;
it comp@@ uted with 450 to 750 incoming refugees .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital have been prepared for this case in recent days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily stop there .
they should then be distributed to other municipalities .
&quot; in the past ten days alone , according to the government pres@@ idency of the government of Gi@@ essen , 7@@ 500 people arrived in H@@ esse . &quot;
&quot; due to the large number of refugees , Frankfurt and Han@@ au have also set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls . &quot;
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
&quot; the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German involvement in Syria for a possibility . &quot;
&quot; I believe the decisive thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
he accused the European states of &quot; collective thinking . &quot;
four years ago it was said that the cup of military participation in Germany has passed .
&quot; now the conflict ends crashing in front of our front door , &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid to refugees .
Austria controls at southern and eastern borders
&quot; after Germany , Austria has again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders . &quot;
&quot; the Austrian Minister for the Interior , Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , declared on Tuesday evening in Austrian TV station ORF , after Hungary no one is sent back . &quot;
&quot; also , Germany did not send refugees back to Austria . &quot;
&quot; no , this is agreed , &quot; she explained . &quot;
&quot; on the question of an agreement that Germany could accommodate a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , there have already been discussions between the General Director of Public Security and representatives of Germany . &quot;
she did not call for concrete figures and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
&quot; in the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees came to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan route from Hungary . &quot;
their goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann requested a special summit for next week with several other EU leaders .
Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
the EU states have so far failed to agree on concer@@ ted action in the crisis .
&quot; the EU interior ministers intend to take a new trial for a binding distribution of more than 120@@ ,000 refugees at a special meeting on Tuesday ( 22 September ) . &quot;
&quot; in view of the strong refugee transport in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people . &quot;
&quot; the Federation will manage this jointly with the L√§nder , Merkel announced on the late Tuesday evening after almost four hour consultations with the Prime Ministers in the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Merkel under@@ lined , those people who needed protection are also compla@@ ining . &quot;
but who does not have a lead perspective can &apos;t stay in Germany either .
this conception was expressed in the round .
&quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; &quot; huge effort &quot; . &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck in the Balkan route .
Hungary closed its 175 km border to Serbia in the night of Tuesday .
&quot; a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced that the border to Romania had to be sealed with a fence . &quot;
this neighboring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
&quot; Hungary wants to prevent smu@@ g@@ gling smu@@ g@@ gling over Romania , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence . &quot;
the Romanian government promptly condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had crossed the fence .
&quot; in Turkey , meanwhile , e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported thousands of other migrants on the way to the Greek border . &quot;
space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
under the ice @-@ p@@ anz@@ er of the Satur@@ n@@ moon En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us a global ocean waves .
this includes researchers from sight@@ ings of the space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the moon turns easily on its orbit around the ring planets . &quot;
&quot; although this do@@ ve movement is only small , but still too big for a continuous cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is called a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US state New York ) from Tuesday . &quot;
the researchers present their analyses in the journal &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
it was already longer known that under the ice ceiling of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us there must be liquid water .
&quot; thus &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; already discovered ice vul@@ can@@ es at the south pole of the Satur@@ n@@ moon in 2006 , sp@@ itting water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feeding the so @-@ called E @-@ Ring of Saturn . &quot;
&quot; at least at the South Pole , there must be a underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed then . &quot;
&quot; the extent of the hidden ocean , however , was not cleared . &quot;
R@@ ama absent in 1860 M√ºnchen several weeks
the 1860 M√ºnchen has to ab@@ stain from Val@@ det R@@ ama for about a month .
an examination showed an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury in the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .
R@@ ama compla@@ ined about pain in the beginning of the week .
&quot; according to Munich Lion , the diagnosis &quot; is expected to be four weeks of forced break . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is hard for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ ald loss . &quot;
&quot; of course , we have to think about it now , &quot; said sports director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ g√º@@ n of the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper with a view to the possible obligation of a uni@@ form@@ less professional . &quot;
&quot; however , the six@@ ties first presented a defensive man as a training guest . &quot;
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract at the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; at present , the Cro@@ at has &quot; the opportunity to prove his skills . &quot; &quot;
&quot; after his conc@@ ussion , Tor@@ j@@ √§ger Rub@@ in Ok@@ ot@@ ie can return to the team training next week . &quot;
&quot; already on Thursday , the Austrian national player should get into running training . &quot;
Ok@@ ot@@ ie was injured in the game at Fort@@ una D√ºsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) in a violent collision at the head .
&quot; against the first fears , however , he remained without a serious cens@@ orship . &quot;
no diet fruit - man@@ goes contain much sugar
man@@ gos are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
but he who wants to pay attention to his slim line is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
&quot; for man@@ gos , they contain a relatively large amount of sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose . &quot;
&quot; the exotic fruits are healthy : in them B vitamins and vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ goes contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor beta @-@ carot@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; those who eat the fruits will thus support vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body . &quot;
&quot; when buying , man@@ goes should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant to smell . &quot;
the colour alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ goes can taste delicious .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
&quot; then , of course , they taste pure or in sweet foods . &quot;
&quot; a man@@ go , however , also gives hearty dishes a special touch . &quot;
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
&quot; a man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well to fish , poultry , lamb and game . &quot;
&quot; the US parcel service U@@ PS returns up to 9@@ 5,000 aid for the Christmas business in the United States . &quot;
&quot; the company has already begun recruitment of seasonal workers , U@@ PS announced on Tuesday . &quot;
especially drivers are sought .
&quot; last year , U@@ PS had already increased its workforce for the holiday season by 9@@ 5,000 people . &quot;
&quot; given the bo@@ oming online business , U@@ PS and its competitor F@@ ed@@ Ex have been taking precau@@ tions since last year to be ready for the Christmas business . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , bel@@ ated deliveries had brought harsh criticism to the pack@@ et service . &quot;
&quot; first storm @-@ storm , then striking cold front &quot;
&quot; in the coming night , in the valleys of the Alp@@ enn@@ ord@@ seite of F@@ √∂hn winds through , like Met@@ e@@ o@@ Schweiz on Tuesday r@@ ushed . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday and on the night to th@@ urs@@ day , the hair @-@ dryer partially blows with storm @-@ strength through the tor@@ so @-@ valleys . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ √∂hn@@ ende on Thursday morning we cross a distinctive cold front , which brings powerful rainf@@ alls , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature decline . &quot;
&quot; as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low@@ pressure area across the British Is@@ les in a powerful south @-@ west current . &quot;
on the side of the mountain@@ side the fo@@ eh@@ n breaks through the valleys on the night .
&quot; as a result , the F@@ √∂hn blow up until Thursday morning in the bo@@ oms of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and partly in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with over 100 km / h . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ √∂hn is capable of penet@@ rating to the adjacent centre of the Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and on the mountains there are even hurri@@ can@@ es of over 120 km / h possible . &quot;
&quot; while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ ming hair dryer ensures summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity begins to st@@ ow at the mountain@@ side . &quot;
&quot; here rain falls , that lasts until Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; in sum , in the next 48 hours south of the Alps , some 100 litres of rain per square meter have to be expected in the next 48 hours . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning the blow dryer leaves the air , as a result , a cold front rolls from west to east with a strong , partly clou@@ dy rain from west to east . &quot;
&quot; along with the cold front , the wind refres@@ hes strong to stor@@ my , and the temperatures go back significantly . &quot;
&quot; the following days are present in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the South , on the other hand , it will be sun@@ nier and warmer at the weekend with up to 25 degrees . &quot;
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
&quot; almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther place in Rome . &quot;
&quot; in the presence of city president Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino , a previously nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was christ@@ ened on the name of the German Re@@ former . &quot;
&quot; at the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now honoured as the &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot;
the park is located right next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um in the middle of Rome .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the working community of the Protestant churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could often only live in secret for centuries as a minority . &quot;
&quot; in a symbolic way , the square becomes visible that its tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome . &quot;
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) considered himself as a young August@@ ine mon@@ k at the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 for a few months in Rome .
&quot; at that time , he found the city as a ruined sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
&quot; according to historians , his negative impressions are likely to have reinforced him in his later fight against Rome . &quot;
Luther had then initiated the division of the oc@@ ci@@ dental church with his thes@@ es against the ab@@ let trade .
hammer artist invested three years into the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gil@@ ded ) Dor@@ nen@@ kr@@ one is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt had painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which has now appeared with magnificent pictures . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , who in 150 motifs formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas . &quot;
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
&quot; on the contrary : adapted to the respective topics , it can be quite glo@@ omy . &quot;
&quot; for about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his Bible project for which he made a subjective @-@ artistic selection from the many subject areas of the &quot; book of all books . &quot; &quot;
&quot; cycles have ar@@ isen that dedic@@ ate themselves to topics such as cross@@ roads , pla@@ gues , bi@@ ds or pat@@ ernity . &quot;
&quot; with this , he has spontaneously fascinated several partners : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its focus on art books . &quot;
&quot; and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who , on the basis of painting , dealt with the respective Bible passages . &quot;
&quot; he interpreted the Bible passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and thus translated into today , in current context . &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible quote by Martin Luther and one set of the artist who formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts on the particular situation .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
&quot; thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old gives twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high level of in@@ timacy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately triggers for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict protest@@ ant ruler . &quot;
&quot; then the education took place with the cane , &quot; &quot; recalls Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot;
I have tried to work up to bring me back to the Lord &apos;s father .
&quot; his second concern is to revi@@ ve art again in a quick@@ y time : &quot; the perception of visual worlds is today shaped by advertising , and that is loud . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is displaced there .
artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewer to &quot; &quot; fall into the pictures &quot; , &quot; let them appear , discover and feel what power they have : &quot; &quot; the picture is looking for its counterpart . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost stood on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; &quot; ever &quot; &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art has been : &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
&quot; I did not pay attention to the fact that the Bible is fully compreh@@ ended , but also chosen for him as well as mysterious themes . &quot;
&quot; this was no cooperation at eye level , &quot; Alt@@ ep@@ ost says : &quot; here is the pictures , the text only explains . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for Hans M@@ √∂h@@ ler of Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts paintings speak for M@@ √∂h@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and that of responsibility .
&quot; a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas prints - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung on November 15th . &quot;
start of construction for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn ( BM@@ X )
&quot; plans made , space found , company commissioned , ground rule model@@ ed for a circuit : one year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X track was finished again . &quot;
&quot; failures in politics and administration ensured that it was dr@@ ink@@ able , especially with residents who did not want the railways . &quot;
&quot; so , hill down@@ wards , new place looked for - now with formal planning and application for building permission . &quot;
&quot; the approval will be received in October , the first joint author Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck could now communicate in the children &apos;s and youth committee . &quot;
&quot; I hope this year will happen again , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it should then be started without a &quot; &quot; further pause &quot; &quot; with the work at the former indoor swimming pool . &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies engagement for refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B wi@@ dens its commitment to refugees by 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga is setting a clear sign on the weekend . &quot;
football responds to the worsen@@ ing situation in Germany and ass@@ ures its help in tac@@ kling the pending problems .
&quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; no one can say in principle , that doesn &apos;t matter to me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; this must interest each individual to get a grip on this subject , &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he will discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively . &quot;
&quot; I am next Wednesday in the Chanc@@ ellery and meet the Minister for State , Mrs √ñ@@ zo@@ ƒü@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the topic will surely play a central role , &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot;
football could and will help .
but the decisive turn@@ out must be the policy .
&quot; for this reason , the German Football Association has extended its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; four years . &quot;
&quot; the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; &quot; stated Ni@@ ers@@ bach on the ver@@ ge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
some of the Bundes@@ liga support this program as well .
&quot; already on this weekend , the 36 professionals put a clear sign on the left tri@@ cot instead of the usual sponsor@@ ing logo ( Her@@ mes ) the im@@ print &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help wherever and how they can , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen sporting director Ru@@ di V√∂l@@ ler in the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the drama of refugees goes to everyone , nobody can om@@ it away . &quot;
&quot; we can do football feder@@ ations , no , we must use our charism@@ a , influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly , &quot; said Her@@ tha manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent mark of the League . &quot;
the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale to qualify for the European Championships against Hungary this Friday .
&quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; a large community of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 licensing agreements in their places would have started their own projects is great .
just as great is that small and small clubs are active .
the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; we spent is lived in football .
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in this and next year , together with the German Federal Government , the association will provide 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees in cooperation with the German Federal Government . &quot;
&quot; the clubs have already called the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach reported . &quot;
reports : CEO of SAP is losing an eye in case of an accident
&quot; according to several reports , the head of the board of Europe &apos;s biggest software corporation , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has lost the left eye through a fall in early July . &quot;
&quot; during the accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA , he fell on a water glass after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is almost bled , impot@@ ent , then dra@@ gged out into the street - that he told us last week , &quot; quoted the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could pursue his work .
&quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot;
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; fully operational . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with the &quot; S√ºd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday issue ) , Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced that he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to lead the software company . &quot;
&quot; I am full for SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said : &quot; everyone can happen that way . &quot;
it is important to stand up again when you fall .

football : Bv@@ B without Re@@ us against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
&quot; at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us in the first group play of the Europa League have finally broken . &quot;
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the football Bundes@@ liga in the du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19@@ .00 hrs / Sky ) .
&quot; we cannot fall back on it , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ game against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B coach left open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in view of the high load of its professionals , the Tu@@ chel will not only change its ancest@@ or position on the Re@@ us position . &quot;
so he announced a change to the goal position .
therefore Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of master keeper Roman natur@@ ki .
&quot; he trained at an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion . &quot;
&quot; however , if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is used in all Europa League games in the future , Tu@@ chel has left open . &quot;
&quot; with a high probability , he will also contest the second game . &quot;
&quot; the for@@ en@@ sic statement by Mit@@ spiel@@ Re@@ us that the final entry for the BV@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , means that central @-@ field player Julian Wei@@ gl believes : &quot; &quot; this is not so wrong with Marco . &quot;
I think we have a good chance to pick up the title .
robot au@@ tos : government wants leadership role for Germany
&quot; according to the German government &apos;s will , Germany should be a technological leader in the change of the car . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet adopted a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the Autom@@ esse IAA from a &quot; new mobility era . &quot;
&quot; automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and provide less traffic , Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said . &quot;
he also wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 countries who also come together with representatives of industry at the IAA .
&quot; among other things , the strategy paper of the ministry of transport emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and rapid change to digital radio communications . &quot;
testing of new technology is currently underway on the free@@ way 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; in order for the driver to &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks arise , &quot; &quot; the Federal Government wants to check the legal framework conditions and , if necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; for example , Germany wants to employ approximately internationally that the permissible maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is raised from 10 to 130 km / h . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Federal Government wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention which so far only fores@@ ees man as a driver . &quot;
&quot; in automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more passengers . &quot;
&quot; the technology is based mainly on sensors and cameras , which capture the environment and process data in seconds . &quot;
&quot; according to a study conducted by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible . &quot;
&quot; however , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads are expected to be expected only far after 2020 . &quot;
the value added in the area of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions in Germany estimate the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; the digital networking of passenger cars can lead to greater security and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said SPD traffic politi@@ cian S@@ √∂ren Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
&quot; however , the question of liability in accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clari@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; the Germans , however , are still skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans . &quot;
&quot; a survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday , commissioned by the For@@ sa Institute , concludes that only eight percent of the Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years . &quot;
&quot; in France , 21 percent of those surv@@ eyed expect up to 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars , 33 per cent in the US . &quot;
&quot; in any case , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle . &quot;
&quot; after a survey of the digital state of Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire trip on all roads . &quot;
&quot; on the motorway , this could at least imagine 15 percent in flowing traffic , in traffic jam 45 percent . &quot;
good every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances under any circumstances .
Bol@@ l says team and double start at table tennis
&quot; after this year &apos;s title fight , the D√ºsseldorf @-@ based D√ºsseldorf will only be able to beat the single one in the single one from September 25 to October 4 . &quot;
the final decision shall be made at the latest on 22 September .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; the boys experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough to get the title without Timo , &quot; &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ trainer J√∂rg Ro@@ √ü@@ kopf during the European course in D√ºsseldorf . &quot;
Bol@@ l was at that time on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed sponsor@@ ing date in China .
the 34 year old German master is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; without Timo is the disadvantage , we are no longer such a clear favourite , &quot; explained Ein@@ zel @-@ Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot;
&quot; Ham@@ el@@ ner , who introduces the S@@ etz@@ der in J@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded the Euro 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at . &quot;
&quot; at that time Timo was also missing , and we became European champion . &quot;
&quot; we should ori@@ ent this by ori@@ enting ourselves , &quot; explained the World Ranking Fi@@ fth . &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : window mannequins which look frigh@@ tening human thanks to video projections .
&quot; they bear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who among other things became the big star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; today , I can no longer say that I am the en@@ f@@ ant of Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; in the past it was ble@@ ached , meanwhile it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen at the Kunsth@@ alle of the Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung in the Kunsth@@ alle of the Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , on September 18 , it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his attitude towards a show over his person . &quot;
&quot; actually he was on the other hand , because : &quot; &quot; for me , an exhibition sounded a bit after death , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; when you die , you come to the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ der . &quot;
&quot; it concerns tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society . &quot;
the exhibits give an insight into the work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
&quot; the show is not built up chron@@ ologically , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ed Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk , for which much effort was carried out : to dev@@ ote the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was dedicated . &quot;
&quot; the makers , according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , have car@@ ded 14 tonnes of material to Munich . &quot;
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was a special delic@@ acy : a leather pants outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers alter Ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , tender modifications of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) , he took on his ted@@ dy bear and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; to play with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him . &quot;
he later contributed to designing fashion .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and saw the designs of other designers as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
&quot; but later , I bought them , of course . &quot;
&quot; for his first own fashion show , he did not have to pay the models . &quot;
&quot; they got nothing , but were allowed to keep the clothes . &quot;
Je@@ wel@@ ry instead of a curtain - P@@ lau@@ ener tip as a fashion niche
&quot; in the past , it went to the long stit@@ ching machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make meters . &quot;
&quot; the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips were created in large quantities for customers , which they used for example for blankets and she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this is no longer working today , &quot; explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the P@@ lau@@ en fashion division . &quot;
&quot; instead , fashion is again important . &quot;
&quot; in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ en peak , fashion played a major role , was then displaced by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories such as bags and in regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans toward past stal@@ ks , is an increasing order potential . &quot;
those who do not use ni@@ ches in the textile industry are no longer on the market .
&quot; with us , they are already doing the half of all orders . &quot;
&quot; together with nine other companies , Mo@@ du@@ ke P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ en Peak and embroi@@ dery . &quot;
only they are allowed to carry the protected label .
&quot; over the past 15 years , some 80 percent of sales have been broken away . &quot;
private specialist shops and wholesale trade almost no longer exist .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
&quot; nowadays , mass production is much cheaper in the Asian region and is sold almost exclusively by chains . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the export is weaker , up @-@ to @-@ date to Russia and the US . &quot;
so there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association also tries to score with environmental awareness , as explained by C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from the Nit@@ ri@@ le in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we have a seal of quality which shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt added : &quot; this also applies to the materials used .
&quot; graduate designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the University of Applied Arts in Z@@ wick@@ au , Germany - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and special@@ ises in embroi@@ dery and lace . &quot;
&quot; to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
it takes time and courage .
&quot; there is a conflict of tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that must first of all think economically , &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , an existing design is often only slightly varied to maintain a customer base . &quot;
&quot; a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter re@@ vit@@ alized the historic snow@@ ball tip . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the machine sticks small spheres at some places . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ lau@@ en Gold@@ schmi@@ ede@@ master@@ in Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ √üe was inspired by it : &quot; before , I could not start with the traditional P@@ lau@@ ener peak . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
&quot; in a complex process , it shapes the pattern in silver . &quot;
&quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of &quot; &quot; P@@ lau@@ ener &quot; &quot; - young and old , &quot; &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; it also supplies to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and its surroundings and who would like to mem@@ or@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; in this way , I see my jewellery as modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ en peak . &quot;
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
&quot; legends should not be touched , but Disney has yet dar@@ ed to make a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; however , it is not a new movie but a kind of sequ@@ el that takes 20 years after the first film with the magic child girl . &quot;
it is about the experiences of the N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the Great Depression in England .
those who play P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
&quot; but the director is already standing : Ro@@ b Marshall , recently with &quot; &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; &quot; in the cinema . &quot;
XI ur@@ ges to open the economy wide for the world
&quot; the economy needs to open wide to promote growth , said President Xi Jin@@ ping on Tuesday of a group charged with the reform of the reform . &quot;
&quot; China should strive to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Command Group for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; promoting new foundations and driving reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , &quot; &quot; said Xi . &quot;
&quot; the Leadership Group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list on the regulation of market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the population reporting system . &quot;
&quot; after the statement , a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment . &quot;
the system is gradually being tested and improved by test programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance as it has a greater role in the allocation of resources to the market , ensuring a right @-@ state business environment and designed the market more open , the statement said . &quot;
the government will also lo@@ osen controls on the powers transferred to the companies and ensure that companies decide how to manage their businesses .
the statement also stated that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
&quot; as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas are opened for private investment . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; moreover , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and making the application process easier . &quot;
&quot; to guarantee lawyers &apos; right to exercise their activities , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot;
Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated in the meeting as announced in a statement issued after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury limit value in predat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predat@@ ory fish and thus exploit the consumers a significantly higher dose of the nerve .
&quot; the consumer organization F@@ ood@@ watch , which has a corresponding working paper of the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of inf@@ alli@@ ble industrial and environmental policy are handed down with full force on pregnant women and to@@ dd@@ lers , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t of F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t , the limit values of the nerve @-@ po@@ ison@@ ous for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish , should be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish . &quot;
&quot; however , large predat@@ ory fish are already so heavily bur@@ dened with mercury , that approximately 50 per cent of the catches cannot be sold on the basis of the existing limit values . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be un@@ available . &quot;
&quot; in return for this loos@@ ening , the EU wants to ag@@ grav@@ ate the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; F@@ ood@@ watch described this as &quot; &quot; trick &quot; &quot; because smaller grav@@ ey@@ ards , such as car@@ ps , are usually so low that they already comply with the planned maximum values today . &quot;
&quot; the lowering in Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de distra@@ ction maneu@@ ver that helps the economy alone , &quot; says Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t . &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans . it is especially rich in predat@@ ory fish over the food chain .
&quot; the German government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; already small amounts can cause &quot; &quot; un@@ born damage to the nervous system &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Federal Environment Ministry declared on its homepage with regard to current maximum values , however , that a &quot; health hazard to the general population &quot; is not expected . &quot;
mercury is primarily caused by coal combustion in the environment .
&quot; according to a written information by the Federal Environment Ministry , the German coal @-@ fired power stations run over six tons of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total quantity reported in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mercury in fish , for example , in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; &quot; permanently and extensively crossed &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; had quoted from the paper in March . &quot;
&quot; last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish were already among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF . &quot;
