&quot; customs authorities take a description of the cargo loading of a road vehicle , a truck or a container at a transit point or on the way , so they must be noted on the corresponding trunk leaves and on the remaining sections remaining in the Car@@ net TI@@ R and the type of checks carried out . &quot;
&quot; if customs contracts in other cases are injured or damaged in the articles 24 and 35 or are damaged or damaged without breach of customs agreements , the protocol contained in Anne@@ x 1 will be included in the Car@@ net TI@@ R protocol ; the internal regulations of the law remain un@@ affected . &quot;

&quot; ( 2 ) The same applies to the part of the route , on which the holder of the Car@@ net TI@@ R in the territory of a contracting party does not use the Car@@ net because a simpler procedure for customs clearance or the use of such a procedure is not required . &quot;

the clearance points of each contracting party recognise the customs agreements and / or in@@ dem@@ n@@ ity signs established by the competent authorities of the other contracting parties .
&quot; however , they may additionally attach customs closures and / or nut marks , but must be noted on the Car@@ net @-@ TI@@ R sections used in their country , on the corresponding stem @-@ sheets and on the remaining sections remaining in the Car@@ net TI@@ R . &quot;
&quot; the customs authorities must remove customs agreements or remove non @-@ call@@ ers at a transit point or on the way because of a sh@@ ading of the goods cargo , so they will mem@@ ori@@ ze the newly attached customs closures and / or ne@@ bul@@ osity marks on the corresponding trunk leaves and the remaining sections in the Car@@ net TI@@ R . &quot;

&quot; a satisfactory proof has been provided by the customs authorities that the goods listed in the commodity manifest of a Car@@ net TI@@ R have been lost or lost or that they are missing due to their nature through natural sw@@ ings , so that exemp@@ tion from the usual wi@@ ese will be granted to considerable duties and duties . &quot;

&quot; B ) The community and the concerned states take the necessary steps to ensure that the inspec@@ tors of the organization , according to their agreement , can actually perform tasks . &quot;
C ) The visits and activities of the inspec@@ tors of the organisation are established in such a way that the possible har@@ ass@@ ment and distur@@ b@@ ance for the community and the states and for the peaceful nuclear activities underlying the inspection are as low as possible ;
II ) to ensure the protection of industrial secrets and others to the inspec@@ tors of the organization for the knowledge of confidential information .
&quot; every state is opposed to the organization , including its assets , funds and assets , as well as to their inspec@@ tors and other officials , the tasks of this Convention , the corresponding provisions of the agreement on the pr@@ ero@@ g@@ atives and liber@@ ations of the International Atom@@ ic Energy Agency . &quot;
&quot; the security measures under this agreement will be terminated in relation to core material , if the community and the organization realize that the material is consumed or dil@@ uted in a way that it is no longer usable or practically non @-@ ref@@ und@@ able under the point of view of the security measures of Bel@@ ang . &quot;
&quot; the Community noti@@ fies the organization according to the provisions of this Convention , the transfer of nuclear material from the States , which is subject to the safegu@@ arding measures under this Convention . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the recipient state , as envis@@ aged in this Convention , the securing measures for this Convention shall be terminated . &quot;
&quot; the organization carries out documents from which each passing and , if necessary , the re@@ use of the securing measures to the given core material . &quot;
&quot; in case of non @-@ nuclear activities such as the manufacture of alloys or ceramics , the association ends with the organization of such use of the material under which circumstances the securing measures can be terminated in relation to this material . &quot;
&quot; II ) that , during the duration of the non @-@ use of the securing measures , the material is not used for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear arsen@@ al bodies . &quot;
B ) The organization and the community make a provision that the securing measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall not be applied for as long as the core material is used in such activity .
&quot; in the scheme , as far as possible , how long and under what circumstances these securing measures are not applied . &quot;
&quot; in any event , the safegu@@ ards planned in this agreement will once again be applied once the core material is returned to a peaceful nuclear activity . &quot;
the organization is kept on the ongoing basis of the total amount and the composition of the material contained in the state or the concerned states and on any passing of such material from this state or these states .
&quot; this explains their understanding as quickly as possible ; it only extends to matters such as temporal and proced@@ ural provisions and agreements for reporting , but does not include a endor@@ sement or a secret knowledge of the military activity and does not apply to the use of the core material . &quot;
&quot; the organization , the community and the states bear the costs that each of them grow in carrying out their respective obligations arising from this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the community , the states or persons who are subject to their sovereign power , however , inc@@ ur extraordinary costs as a result of a special request of the organization , so the organisation reimbur@@ ses these costs , provided that it has agreed beforehand . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the organization carries the costs of all additional measurements and sampling required by the inspec@@ tors of the organization . &quot;
&quot; the Community and States make sure that the liability for nuclear damage , including insurance or other financial security , may be used in accordance with their laws and other provisions , to the organisation and its officials for the purposes of carrying out this Convention in the same way as to the nationals of the states . &quot;
any claim that the community or the state against the organization or the organization against the community or the state for damages - except for damages arising from a nuclear incident - shall be regulated in accordance with international law .
&quot; after examining the relevant information submitted by the General Director , the Council is not able to verify that no core material , which must be subject to securing measures under this Convention , shall reimbur@@ se the reports provided in Article X@@ II ( C ) of the Stat@@ utes and , if necessary , take the other measures provided there . &quot;
&quot; in such steps , the Council takes into account what mass was acquired by the applied security measures , and offers the community or the state - as far as each of the two parties concerned - every reasonable opportunity to grant the Council the necessary security . &quot;
&quot; on request of the organization , community or state , consultations are held on questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the States are entitled to seek out from the Council , that questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be examined by the Council . &quot;
the Council invites the community and the affected state to take part in the discussion of such questions by the Council .
&quot; disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention , and which are not agreed in the negotiation path or by another by the organization , the community and the states , shall be lod@@ ged on the request of a party to appoint a arbit@@ ral tribunal which consists of five arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the community and the states design@@ ate two arbitr@@ ators , the organization also names two arbitr@@ ators , and the four arbitr@@ ators named arbitr@@ ators elect a fifth , who leads the chair@@ manship . &quot;
&quot; if the Community and the States or the organization have not named two arbitr@@ ators within thirty @-@ three days after the request for an arbit@@ ration , the community or organization may seek to appoint the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint these arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
the same procedure is applicable if within thirty days after nam@@ ing or appo@@ inting the fourth arbitr@@ ator the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been elected .
a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal shall be competent and all decisions require the consent of at least three arbitr@@ ators .
&quot; the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal shall be binding for the organisation , the community and the concerned states . &quot;
&quot; this Convention shall apply to non @-@ nuclear dis@@ armament states , the contracting party of the contract and become members of the association , in force , i ) if the relevant state of the organization states that its procedures for the entry into force of this Convention are concluded . &quot;
&quot; II ) If the community of the organization states that it is able to apply its security measures in relation to this state , for the purposes of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The organization , the community and the states consult each other on the request of one of the Parties to change this Convention . &quot;
&quot; B ) All changes require the consent of the Organization , the Community and the States . &quot;
C ) The General Director instruc@@ ts all member states of the organization immediately from any change in this Convention .
&quot; a ) This Convention enters into force on the day , in which the organization of the Community and the States receives the written notification that their procedures for entry into force are concluded . &quot;
B ) This Convention shall remain in force as long as the States are the contracting party of the contract .
the term &quot; Convention &quot; used in this agreement means the Convention and the Protocol .
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to specify the procedures to be applied in the implementation of the provisions of Part I on security measures as required .
&quot; the aim of the safegu@@ arding measures laid down in this agreement is the timely detection of significant quantities of core material of peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear arsen@@ als for unknown purposes , as well as deter@@ rence from such a bran@@ ching by the risk of early detection . &quot;
&quot; in order to enrich the target defined in Article 28 , material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , combined with spatial input and observation as important supplementary measures . &quot;
&quot; the technical conclusion of the examination by the organization is carried out by an explanation , in which material quantity not proven for a particular period of time is specified for a specific time period , indicating the level of accuracy for the specified amounts . &quot;
&quot; when performing their follow @-@ up examinations , the organization makes after Article 3 full use of the security system of the Community . &quot;
the accounting and control system of the Community for Nu@@ clear Material in accordance with this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
&quot; when applying its security measures , the Community of de Proced@@ ures and Meas@@ ures will make use of de procedures and measures of the following manner and , as far as necessary , anticipate how they are more determined and useful in the supple@@ mental agreements : &quot;
&quot; a ) a measuring system for determining the amounts of preserved , produced , offset , lost , lost or otherwise removed from the stock , core material and inventory ; &quot;
B ) assessing the reprodu@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ;
&quot; C ) Proced@@ ure for determining , checking and evaluating differences in the measurements of sender and recipient ; &quot;
e ) procedures to evaluate the accumulation of non @-@ measured continu@@ ances and losses measured ;
&quot; F ) a protocol - and reporting system , which indicates the core material inventory and the changes of this stock , including the inputs and outputs of the material balance zone ; &quot;
g ) precau@@ tions to ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Proced@@ ure to reimbur@@ se reports to the organization in accordance with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the security measures under this Convention do not extend to material mining or ore processing .
&quot; B ) Ur@@ an - or th@@ ori@@ um@@ containing material , which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described under letter c ) , will be introduced into the States , so the community of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material , unless it is introduced for specifically non @-@ nuclear purposes ; &quot;
&quot; C ) relies on core material that is suitable for fuel production or is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , the plant or process phase where it is produced , or is this core material or other , in a later phase of the nuclear fuel cycle produced in the States , it is subject to the other securing measures mentioned in this agreement . &quot;
&quot; a ) The safegu@@ arding measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be terminated for nuclear material under the conditions mentioned in Article 11 . if the provisions mentioned in Article 11 are not fulfilled or desired , the organisation and the community consult each other via the application of appropriate securing measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The safegu@@ ards envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 13 , provided that the organisation and the Community agree that this core material is practically non @-@ ref@@ und@@ able . &quot;
&quot; on request of the Community , the organization fre@@ es the following core material from the security measures following this agreement : &quot;
a ) special spl@@ itting material when used in gram or smaller amounts as a sensor in instruments ;
&quot; B ) Nu@@ clear material , if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities according to Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and &quot;
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 which is over 80 % .
&quot; on request of the Community the organization fre@@ es the core material , which would otherwise be subject to securing measures under this agreement , from these hed@@ ging measures , provided that the entire material delivered in the States is no longer at any time as a result of this article in the States . &quot;
a ) a total of a kil@@ ogram of special p@@ alli@@ ble material consisting of one or more of the following materials :
&quot; ( II ) Ur@@ an with enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calcul@@ ates through multip@@ lication of its weight by enrich@@ ment , &quot;
&quot; ur@@ anium with a enrich@@ ment , which is below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the nature ur@@ anium , calcul@@ ates through multip@@ lication of its weight with the five @-@ fold square of the enrich@@ ment ; &quot;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) Tw@@ enty metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
&quot; delivered core material together with core material , which is subject to the protection measures under this agreement , shall be processed or stored , so precau@@ tions for the re@@ use of the securing measures are met on that material . &quot;
&quot; the association meets with the organization of supplementary agreements , which in the scope which is required for the successful and effective provision of the tasks of the organization according to this agreement , in particular determine how to apply the procedures established in the Convention . &quot;
the supplementary agreements can be extended or changed without alter@@ ing the agreement between the organization and the community .
&quot; the organization , the community and the states undertake all efforts so that these agreements can enter into force within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organisation , the community and the states . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the initial report mentioned in Article 62 of the initial report , the organization will carry out a summari@@ zed inventory of the core material contained in the states , regardless of its origins , and continues to carry on this inventory based on the subsequent reports and the results of their review . &quot;
&quot; between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organization ( Organisation ) &quot;
&quot; the EW@@ G has decided to contribute to the special action programme established at the conference for international economic cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low in@@ comes , whose development is ham@@ pered by general resource transfer problems . &quot;
&quot; C ) It is the objective of the E@@ EC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months of the entry into force of the agreement , and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal . &quot;
D ) The E@@ EC and the organization have consul@@ ted each other about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the middle @-@ ties to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
&quot; to this end , the organisation of the E@@ EC has presented a table from which it is evident how to apply the criteria set out in this Agreement . &quot;
&quot; the organization direc@@ ts a special account under the name &quot; &quot; Special Respon@@ sive Account &quot; &quot; which is made up of the funds that the Member States have to contribute to the special action account ; this account is governed by the organization as administrator , and only to the purpose specified in this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
the special transaction account is managed separately and separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
&quot; the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment shall be made in the form of cash or non @-@ interest notes issued by the member state , which are to be paid on demand in the currency of the respective state at the order of the organization as the administrator of the special transaction account and to deposit at the depos@@ iting point of the organization in the country concerned . &quot;
&quot; B ) The payment shall be made in two install@@ ments , namely i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the contribution within 30 days after entry into force of this agreement or to another between the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker . &quot;
&quot; II ) the second in the amount of the remainder of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or another date agreed between the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker , taking into account the dates required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans . &quot;
C ) Every Member State may be entitled to make payments before the above dates .
&quot; in accordance with the usual procedures , the bai@@ li@@ ff takes approximately proportional draw on the cash or the school junk to cover the expenses for the special transaction bank and balance the special transaction account in an appropriate manner . &quot;
&quot; in the granting of these loans , the car@@ et@@ aker can be derived from the following factors according to the E@@ EC conditions : &quot;
to the extent that international economic factors contributed to the current and fores@@ eeable economic problems of the country ;
VI ) the composition and tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its further lending capacity to loan conditions without dis@@ counted rates ; and
VII ) the extent to which the problems of the concerned countries can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
&quot; any special transaction loan is used to fund a clearly defined and rapidly exp@@ and@@ able development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral project ) , regardless of whether it is to the loan program of the organization , which is considered , approved and administr@@ ated for the purposes of the organization funded by the organization , with the aim of the bi@@ ble to be taken into account in the letter b ) . &quot;
&quot; the funds of the special transaction account must not be used instead of ordinary funds from the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organization , which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organization on the day of entering into force . &quot;
&quot; apart from Section 4 , special transaction loans are subject to the same provisions that apply to the development loans granted by the organization ; they are therefore ref@@ und@@ able at ten years of age in 50 years . &quot;
&quot; special transaction loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States , and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies . &quot;
amounts to pay this watch are to be paid directly to the organization they retain .
&quot; each special transaction is issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in which the origin of the funds is stated in particular . &quot;
&quot; the proceeds from any special transaction bank can be used for expendi@@ tures in the currency of the bene@@ fici@@ ary or for goods or services , which are manufactured respectively ( i ) in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries , which are members of the organization and that may be the recipient of a special transaction loan at the time of loan guarantee . &quot;
&quot; payments of a special transaction bank are transferred to the special transaction account , and the amount paid in the currency of a member state is to be transferred back as soon as possible from the administrator to the Member State concerned . &quot;
&quot; the Administrator obli@@ ges the E@@ EC to complete all of the special transaction loans , through the projects and programs approved by the directors in preparation for the audit by the directors . &quot;
&quot; during the period of payment of the special transaction bank , the administrator teaches the E@@ EC quarterly on the development of the special transaction loan and the expenses made for this purpose . &quot;
&quot; as soon as possible after completion of the financial year , the administrator transm@@ its a detailed account of the special transaction account with a statement from the external audi@@ tor of the organization for this statement . &quot;
&quot; as soon as possible , the manager of the E@@ EC transm@@ its a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special transaction bank after full payment of the special transaction bank . &quot;
&quot; the administrator creates and performs appropriate records and accounts , from which the contributions to the special transaction account , the amounts payable to the account and the payments paid from the account , and the withdraw@@ als paid to the Member States . &quot;
the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker work closely together to achieve the goals of this agreement .
&quot; to this end , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker to the full issue of the means of the special transaction from time to time provide an exchange of ideas about the status of the special transaction , the progress of the programmes or plans financed by special action figures and on all other questions concerning the provisions of this Agreement . &quot;
&quot; this agreement was not entered into force on December 31 , 1978 , or at a later date , which the E@@ EC and the organization , if necessary , entered into force , so the agreement and all the obligations of the parties with immediate effect are due . &quot;
&quot; if the total capital amount of all of the recipients is ref@@ unded in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this Agreement and re@@ mitted to the Member States , this agreement and all the obligations of the parties shall be terminated with immediate effect . &quot;
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the E@@ EC in accordance with the proced@@ ural rules of each party .
the governments of the Member States notified the General Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities to conclude the proceedings in question .
the General Sec@@ retariat guides these noti@@ fications along with a Noti@@ fication on the proper authorization of this agreement by the E@@ EC to the organisation .
this agreement is effective and enters into force on the first day of the month following the day of receipt of the mentioned noti@@ fications in the organization .
&quot; this agreement is written in two manus@@ cripts written in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch . &quot;
&quot; whereas the agreement should be concluded in the form of a letter change to the amend@@ ment of the Anne@@ x A of the Protocol no . 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) , HA@@ T has issued the following : &quot;
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics
&quot; EURO@@ P@@ Ä@@ IS@@ CHE Atom@@ ic Community , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after called &quot; Commission . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Switzerland , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Bundes@@ rat . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this program includes the creation of a large test facility , the J@@ ET project ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation are named after Chapter V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty - herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Joint Company J@@ ET . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for several years , Switzerland has been involved in research in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics , and is well acquainted with the area concerned . &quot;
&quot; up to the practical use of controlled nuclear fusion to carry out extensive work , it is in the interest of the contracting parties of the present agreement to sum@@ mar@@ ise their respective efforts to avoid unnecessary over@@ laps and to accelerate their respective research activities which have gained a higher priority due to the energy crisis - &quot;
&quot; this agreement will enable every contracting party to achieve the greatest benefit by combining its research efforts in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics from the funds provided for the mutual research work , i.e. , the cost @-@ competitive electricity generation by using the controlled nuclear fusion reaction . &quot;
&quot; to achieve the target of the present agreement , the contracting parties associate their respective research programmes defined in Anne@@ x I and II , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom Programme &quot; and &quot; Schweizer Programme . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure effective cooperation , the Swiss programme takes over the long @-@ term goals and forms of co @-@ operation of the Eur@@ atom program ; it will be expanded or changed according to review by articles 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present agreement , which may include new activities relevant to the Eur@@ atom program . &quot;
&quot; each time the contracting parties accept a new program , this will take place in the place of the programs listed in Anne@@ x I and II . &quot;
the association designated in paragraph 1 is realised by : - Ap@@ propri@@ ate participation of each of the contracting parties during the preparation and implementation of the programmes of the other party ;
&quot; - Exchange of personnel among the relevant laboratories in the Eur@@ atom Member States , Switzerland and the third countries , with whom Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , as well as the laboratories working on the Eur@@ atom program ; &quot;
- mutual right to access to the scientific and technical results of the respective programs .
&quot; as part of the target of the present agreement , Switzerland particip@@ ates in the J@@ ET project . &quot;
&quot; in view of the association agreement intended in Article 2 of this Agreement , the Parties concluded an association agreement , which is as far as possible to those between the Commission and the States and companies or individuals , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Associ@@ ated Organ@@ s , &quot; with regard to the realization of the Eur@@ atom program . &quot;
&quot; with the same objective , Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland is involved with the time of the entry into force of the present agreement on the promotion of personnel exchange , which is concluded between the Commission and the Associ@@ ated Organ@@ s , herein@@ after called &quot; Agreement on Human Resources Exchange . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with regard to J@@ ET &apos;s involvement in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland is part of the current agreement on J@@ ET , whose statutes it accepts . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland can become a contractual partner of any contract with the exception of association agreements or other similar contracts concluded by Eur@@ atom during the validity of the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; the organs , which are contracted to carry out the association intended in Article 2 of the present agreement , are described in Article 5 to 10 of this Agreement and in the Association Agreement . &quot;
&quot; the association agreement , in particular , includes the sub@@ stitution of a steering committee , the responsible representative of the Commission and the Council of the Federation . &quot;
&quot; - to monitor the development of research work , so that the best possible results can be achieved in accordance with the goals of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; Switzerland is represented by a maximum of two delegates in the connection group , which is used as part of the Eur@@ atom program , in the following &quot; VG . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the VG , which has to ensure the exchange of information and cooperation in all questions concerning the ongoing or planned programs and activities in the area of the Eur@@ atom program , assumes this task with respect to all research and development activities that this agreement relates . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it promotes cooperation and coordination between the associated organs and is aimed at the joint aim of the two parties involved in the Eur@@ atom Programme and the Swiss programme as well as on the joint goal specified in Article 1 of the present agreement , while the scientific and technological developments in the world are du@@ ly taken into account . &quot;
&quot; according to its Rules of Proced@@ ure , the VG ap@@ points one or more Swiss representatives in the advisory groups created within the framework of the Eur@@ atom program whenever the relevant Swiss authorities seek . &quot;
&quot; the counselling groups , which the VG research proposals submit to the best possible scientific results for the Eur@@ atom program , take this task with regard to all research and development work that is taken into account in this agreement . &quot;
&quot; as part of the Eur@@ atom program , Switzerland is represented by the director of one of the participating laboratories . &quot;
&quot; the Committee of Directors to monitor the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program and which is responsible for optimal use of the capacity of laboratories , which are involved in the work carried out within the framework of the program , provides this task with respect to all research and development activities that fall under the present agreement . &quot;
he is responsible for the best possible use of the personnel and for the exchange of the same between the laboratories involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program and the Swiss programme .
a Swiss representative is entitled to participate in the meetings of all coordination committees in the framework of the Eur@@ atom program .
&quot; the coordin@@ ating committees , which have appropriate proposals for the best use of the means , personnel as well as the knowledge and skills involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program , take this task in the respective area with regard to all research and development work that fall under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; the BA@@ F is responsible for the core and energy research of each Member State of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and any third country . &quot;
&quot; on request of the Commission , the BA@@ F advises the Commission on the implementation of the programme and any changes in the exec@@ utions as well as the preparation of the future programmes and the determination of their total size , coordination and integration of national activities at community level in the merger . &quot;
&quot; the opinions of the BA@@ F , the VG , the Direc@@ torate Committee , the Advisory Group and the coordination committees have a consult@@ ative character . &quot;
the statement of the VG to the urgent actions is compulsory ; the same applies to the committee of directors in the field of personnel exchange .
the representatives of the two parties are working on the work of all technical advisory boards or all administrative bodies created for the purposes of the present agreement .
Switzerland &apos;s financial contribution to the Eur@@ atom program in accordance with this agreement is set annually on an amount that is at the same rate as the gross domestic product of Switzerland to the total gross domestic product of Eur@@ atom and Switzerland in the previous year .
&quot; regarding the J@@ ET project , this financial contribution refers to Eur@@ atom &apos;s participation in the joint venture as soon as it is established . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Switzerland transfers the amount of J@@ ET to the Common Utility J@@ ET , which is to be determined in accordance with the financial terms of the stat@@ ute of this common company . &quot;
&quot; the financial contribution , which Eur@@ atom provides to finance the work as part of the association agreement and the agreement on human exchange , is calculated on the same basis , which is normally used to calculate the Eur@@ atom contributions to the financing of the works , which are carried out due to the corresponding contracts . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the Commission informs the Federal Council about the amount to cover the expenditure within the framework of the Eur@@ atom program for the year . &quot;
the Federal Council pays the amount due to this article as follows : 7 / 12 before the 15 . January and 5 / 12 before the 15 .
July . the other payment options for the financial contributions of Switzerland and Eur@@ atom in accordance with this article are specified in Anne@@ x III to the present agreement .
&quot; Switzerland sei@@ zes all necessary measures to prevent Eur@@ atom from duties or other duties , as well as import restrictions and restrictions on the part of the items financed by Eur@@ atom , which are to be used in Switzerland for activities within the framework of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in this country , imported or acquired items may not be disposed of or free of charge in this country unless approved by the Federal Council . &quot;
these liber@@ ations are not applicable to rest and pensions that are paid to these people .
&quot; the provisions on access to the knowledge provided in Article 2 Section 1 of the present Agreement shall be governed by Article 14 and 15 of this Agreement , in the Association Agreement and in the Agreement on Human Resources Exchange . &quot;
the provisions on access to the knowledge that apply to J@@ ET &apos;s joint venture in Switzerland are regulated in Article 14 of this Agreement and in the Charter of the Joint Company .
the right of each contracting party to access to the knowledge of the other party is an essential part of this agreement .
&quot; - the exchange of personnel among the participating laboratories in Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and the associated third countries ; &quot;
&quot; - appropriate consideration of companies in Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and the associated third countries in awar@@ ding contracts for the implementation of the two associated programs according to the principle of the best possible exploitation of the amounts used . &quot;
&quot; the knowledge gained during the validity of this agreement in Eur@@ atom and in the associated organs in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics , will be provided by Switzerland and individuals or companies that justify access to these knowledge under the same conditions as the Member States , persons or companies of Eur@@ atom . &quot;
&quot; the knowledge gained during the research activities in Switzerland will be communicated to the Member States of Eur@@ atom and the associated third countries , as well as individuals or companies , who are conducting research or production activities in a Member State of Eur@@ atom or affiliated third @-@ state , who justify access to this knowledge . &quot;
&quot; the parties share this knowledge to other states , persons or companies only if a trade agreement is made between the parties , unless these persons or companies operate in Switzerland research or production activities that justify access to this knowledge . &quot;
&quot; if the knowledge specified under section 1 and 2 of this article is protected by patents , these patents may be used by the Member States of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland , the associated third countries and individuals or companies located in the respective countries for research purposes in pursuit of the goals of this agreement . &quot;

&quot; I honor you to confirm the consent of the Community on these changes , and propose to you as an appointment for entry into force 1 January 1978 . &quot;

I honor you to confirm the receipt of your present letter with the following wording :
I would be grateful if you would confirm the consent of your government to the above . &quot;
agreement in the form of a letter exchange between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the mobil@@ isation of the demands of the Member States within the medium @-@ term financial advisory board
the BI@@ S could close stand@@ by loan agreements with central banks of credi@@ tor countries if the banks provide a corresponding application .
&quot; the agreement could be concluded by the total amount of the contribution paid by the credi@@ tor to the mechanism paid by the credi@@ tor , and within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion invo@@ icing units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future delivery funds of the member countries . &quot;
&quot; even now , however , some conditions are mentioned below , for whose application the BI@@ S would be ready . &quot;
&quot; with each stand @-@ by credit , the BI@@ S would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of renew@@ als , but without exceeding five years . &quot;
&quot; in the opening of the loans , as well as in the extension of any extension , the BI@@ S would calculate a credit opening commission . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , it would be agreed that the first drawing should not be made before the exp@@ iry of a month after termination of the Stand@@ by agreement so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to their own liquidity . &quot;
&quot; the draw would take place in the currencies available at the BI@@ S at the end of the agreement , most likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods that would take into account the funds of the bank , presumably three or six months . &quot;
&quot; the conditions would correspond to those applied to the BI@@ S at the time under similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would largely correspond to market rates . &quot;
&quot; if the BI@@ S has to obtain the necessary funds on the market itself , then the interest rate coming to the application could reach a maximum that corresponds to a corresponding margin of higher Li@@ bor . &quot;
I would be grateful if you would give me the consent of the Council of the European Communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BI@@ S could close stand@@ by loan agreements with central banks of credi@@ tor countries if the banks impose a corresponding application . &quot;
I would be grateful if you would give me the consent of the Council of the European Communities .

in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine@@ an Republic on the trade with H@@ amm@@ el and lamb
&quot; I honor the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to set provisions on the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat flesh from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the joint market organisation for sheep and goat &apos;s meat from the community . &quot;
&quot; - fresh or cooled h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ; &quot;
&quot; as part of this agreement , export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the community are set to the following annual amount : 20,000 tons , expressed in slaugh@@ ter@@ body weight ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Argentina is required to ensure that the quantity of the annual quantity did not exceed the agreed amount and is carried out according to traditional quot@@ ations ( frozen or cooled ) . &quot;
&quot; should a change in the offer form be possible as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement consult each other before introducing such a change in the committee referred to under the number 10 to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community takes the safeguard clause , it comm@@ its itself to ensure that the access to Argentina &apos;s access to the common market is not affected by this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the imports from Argentina exceed agreed quantities in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Argentina for the rest of the year . &quot;
the community is obliged to limit the exhaus@@ tion to imports of products collected by this agreement on a 10 b.@@ H ho@@ e . ad val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; with the entry of new Member States , the Community in consultation with Argentina changes the quantity set by number 2 according to the scope of Argent@@ inian trade with each new Member State . &quot;
&quot; the import charges for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; in this context , the number 5 shall be taken into account . &quot;
&quot; the total quantity , named under number 2 , is determined by the day of the accession of Greece to the community to 23 000 tonnes of slaugh@@ ter@@ body weight . &quot;
&quot; the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development , which could compromise the marketing of Argent@@ ine@@ an h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat on the common market within the agreed quantities . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the Community makes arrangements so that the shipments of frozen meat in frozen meat are not under@@ mined because of the implementation of the Ord@@ in@@ ance in the Par@@ agra@@ ph of Argent@@ ine H@@ amm@@ el and lamb . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual application of re@@ funds or other remedi@@ al measures for the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb , as well as the slaugh@@ tering of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs , is only at prices and conditions that comply with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional proportion of the community in world trade with these products . &quot;
&quot; these terms can be interpreted in a way that is compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T , and in particular Article 10 ( 2 letter c ) of the Convention on the interpretation and application of Article VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the Universal Custom@@ s and Trade Agreement . &quot;
&quot; Argentina guarantees compliance with this agreement , in particular by granting export lic@@ ences set out in this agreement for the products mentioned under the number 1 . &quot;
&quot; the Community , on its part , obli@@ ges itself to meet all necessary precau@@ tions , so that the distribution of import lic@@ ences for the aforementioned products with origin in Argentina will be made dependent on the presentation of an export licence , which is assigned by the competent authority designated by the Argent@@ ine@@ an government . &quot;
the details of the application of this system are determined in such a way that the position of a security deposit for the issu@@ ance of import license may be wai@@ ved .
&quot; in terms of implementing provisions , the competent Argent@@ ine@@ an authority of the competent authority of the community in regular intervals reports the amounts given to the export lic@@ ences ; these data may , if necessary , en@@ code according to destination country . &quot;
the committee is responsible for ensuring that the agreement is properly applied and works smoothly .
&quot; it regularly reviews the tendency of the H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat market of both parties and on the world market as well as the sales conditions in these markets , including conditions that are of importance to the goal named above . &quot;
&quot; the Committee shall ensure that the proper use of this agreement will not be affected by the fact that products from H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat will be carried out under the agreement , under the agreement , not mentioned . &quot;
the committee will discuss all questions arising during the implementation of this agreement and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities .
the provisions of this Agreement shall apply without prejudi@@ ce to the rights and obligations of the parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .
the annual amount specified under number 2 is valid for the period from 1 January to 31 December .
&quot; the amount that comes from the entry into force of this agreement , up to 1 January of the following year , is determined in proportion to the total annual amount and takes account of the seasonal nature of the trade . &quot;
&quot; this agreement applies to the areas where the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Argentina on the one hand . &quot;
&quot; it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; after that date , it remains in force , subject to the right of every party , to termin@@ ate it in writing with a period of one year . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the provisions of this agreement will be reviewed by the two parties before 1 April 1984 , with regard to changes they consider necessary to be deemed necessary . &quot;
I would be grateful if you would like to express the consent of your government .
I honor to confirm the receipt of your present letter with the following wording :

&quot; human thorou@@ gh@@ bred can only be shipped in containers , where the temperature can be kept at 4 C to 6 C during transport . &quot;
&quot; the preparations mentioned in Part II of this Protocol must be sterile , ap@@ y@@ rogen and non @-@ toxic . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to add the consi@@ gn@@ ments necessary to the in@@ fusion , as well as the sol@@ vents for dry preparations . &quot;
human thorou@@ gh@@ bred is taken from a healthy person and blood is mixed with a suitable anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant .
C ) which are not free of diseases transmitted by blood trans@@ fu@@ sions as far as this can be ensured by simple medical examination and medical history .
&quot; the blood is as@@ ep@@ tic ; the blood is gli@@ de through a closed , sterile tube system into a sterile bottle , into which the anti@@ co@@ agulation solution was merged before steri@@ li@@ zing . &quot;
&quot; once the blood is removed , the bottle has to be closed immediately and cooled to a temperature of 4 C to 6 C . afterwards , it must be opened immediately before using the blood . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ co@@ agulation solution may not be more than 220 ml per litre of human thorou@@ gh@@ bred , and the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration may not drop 97 g per litre . &quot;
the blood group after the A @-@ B @-@ 0 system is to be determined by hand of the blood cells and the serum ; the determination of the R@@ h factor is carried out by examining the blood cells at a new sample of the don@@ or @-@ blood .
&quot; as far as there are standardized or recommended procedures for blood group determination in individual countries , these are applicable . &quot;
&quot; the term &quot; &quot; R@@ h @-@ negative &quot; &quot; is only to be used if specific investigations have yiel@@ ded the absence of the anti@@ gens C , D , you and E . &quot;
the blood exchanged for this agreement should only be used for recipients of the corresponding AB @-@ 0 group .
&quot; human thorou@@ gh@@ bred is to be stored in sterile , closed bottle against micro @-@ organisms and until its use is permitted at a temperature of 4 to 6 C ; higher temperatures are permitted only during the time required for testing and transport , which must be at most 30 minutes to cool off immediately to 4 to 6 C . &quot;
&quot; a concentrate of human red blood cells is a unit of human thorou@@ gh@@ bred , from which the greatest part of the plasma has been removed . &quot;
it contains all red blood cells of the unit from which it has been extracted ; other blood cells can be present or may have been partially removed .
the liquid content of the concentr@@ ates consists of either the remaining plasma or a suitable is@@ ot@@ onic artificial wat@@ ery solution that was added after the plasma was removed .
&quot; the volume of red blood cells should be between 65 and 75 % of the total volume of the product ; however , a higher concentration of red blood cells is used , so the approximate percentage of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te volume ( ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t ) is to be indicated on the label . &quot;
&quot; all processes required for production must take place under as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . the sealing needs to be carried out using a sterile , closed system and only by pressure . &quot;
&quot; an artificial wat@@ ery solution has been added , so on the label its volume and composition must be stated . &quot;
&quot; the human dry plasma is obtained through drying of the liquid , which is deposited at the top of the centri@@ fu@@ gi@@ ation or sedi@@ ment of the human body . &quot;
&quot; the human dry plasma is obtained by cold @-@ drying or any other method , by which a den@@ atur@@ ation of the proteins is avoided . &quot;
&quot; the dry product can easily be dissolved in a quantity of water , which corresponds to the quantity of liquid that is produced when producing the substance . &quot;
&quot; the protein concentration of the solution won should not be less than 45 g per litre , and the solution must not have visible signs of ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis products . &quot;
donations in which ( using a cream sample ) have been found to include a hazardous content of is@@ ha@@ em@@ oly@@ s@@ ine or immune hem@@ ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ine are excluded .
&quot; if the plasma is not mixed and frozen within 48 hours after the blood withdrawal , the ster@@ ility of each unit must be detected in a quantity of at least 10 ml . &quot;
&quot; in order to eliminate the harmful effect of the bacterial growth products in plasma , blood donations , the signs of a bacterial infection , are not used ; the ster@@ ility of each donation must be proven in a quantity of at least 10 ml . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the risk of transmission of viral hepatitis , there are mixtures that do not contain more than 12 donations , or to apply other methods that are known to reduce this risk in a comparable way . &quot;
&quot; one of the liquid quantity demanded in the production of plasma is to add corresponding water quantity ; the substance must be completely dissolved within 10 minutes , 15 to 20 C . &quot;
&quot; a given quantity of plasma is dissolved in the quantity of water , which corresponds to the quantity of liquid produced from which it was produced ; the solution is subjected to the following tests : &quot;
&quot; a sufficient amount of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ chlori@@ de or calcium chlori@@ de can be used for 1 ml solution , thus acceler@@ ating ; the process can be accelerated in the brood @-@ furnace at 37 C . &quot;
&quot; due to the 24 @-@ hour drying process in the presence of phosph@@ or pent@@ oxi@@ des under a maximum of 0,@@ 02 mm of mercury , weight losses may not occur over 0.5 % in the human dry plasma . &quot;
&quot; human dry plasma is stored in a nitrogen atmosphere or in an empty room in a sterile , sealed bottle under exclusion of any micro @-@ organisms and after the possibility of any moisture ; it is to be protected from light and to keep at a temperature below 20 ° C. &quot;
human alb@@ um@@ in and frac@@ tions made of human plasma proteins are preparations of the protein component consisting of about 60 % of the total protein mass of the plasma of the human body .
&quot; regardless of whether the final product should be fluid or dry , the preparation must be heated to 60 C ± 0.5 C for 10 hours after adding a suitable stabili@@ zer in the final container to in@@ activate the patho@@ gen of the viral hepatitis . &quot;
in preparations made from human alb@@ um@@ in at least 95 % of the weight of the existing proteins alb@@ um@@ in must be alb@@ um@@ in .
&quot; in both preparations , no more than 10 mg of immuno@@ glob@@ ulin G per gram of the product may be present . &quot;
&quot; if the end product is frozen , it must contain at least 950 mg of protein per gram of the product . &quot;
&quot; if the fraction of human plasma proteins is produced as a solution , it must have a total protein concentration between 45 and 50 g per liter . &quot;
&quot; if human alb@@ um@@ in is produced as a solution , it must have a total protein concentration of at least 45 g per liter . &quot;
&quot; comparative measurements of vis@@ cosity and clou@@ ding as well as centri@@ fu@@ ging with ultra@@ centri@@ fu@@ ge and electro@@ ph@@ or@@ esis , which are carried out before and after heating to the solutions , may not give evidence of den@@ atur@@ ation of dissolved proteins . &quot;
&quot; after heating up to 57 C and six @-@ level bulk solids in a mechanical seal machine at this temperature , the solution must be completely free of visible particles . &quot;
I ) The precip@@ itation tests with specific anti@@ sera have to show that only human plasma proteins are contained in both preparations ;
&quot; the electro@@ ph@@ or@@ esis indicated by free floating particles below acceptable and suitable conditions must show that the protein fraction , which is the mot@@ ility of the alb@@ um@@ ina component of normal human plasma , is at least 95 % in preparations made from human plasma proteins at least 85 % of the protein mass . &quot;

the ti@@ ter is measured by repeated di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to the double in a suitable medium .
the ti@@ tr@@ ation is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution is calculated solely by the volume of blood flow in@@ und@@ ations in the total volume .
&quot; for anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents used on object carriers , the activity is expressed through time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier . &quot;
&quot; the World Health Organization has set up international standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood group determination International standards , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity are elabor@@ ated at present standards . &quot;
&quot; according to definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the Tit@@ ans observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination of most specific@@ ity is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ ists , which is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te in@@ fusion . &quot;

the exp@@ ir@@ ation date for dry re@@ agents on the label is based on the results of the durability tests ; it is approved by the state supervisory authorities .
&quot; dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is closed so that no moisture can penetrate . &quot;
&quot; a dry re@@ agent may lose at most 0.5 per cent of its weight , if it is tested by further drying over phosph@@ or@@ us @-@ oxy@@ de at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg in 24 hours . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent state authority can determine that the re@@ agent ( or the sol@@ vents delivered with the dry re@@ agents ) is added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , provided that the re@@ agent and the added substance continue to perform the requirements for specific@@ ity and effectiveness . &quot;
sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg protein nitrogen per ml fluid or re@@ dissolved serum .

&quot; the re@@ agents for the international exchange of blood group determination should not be colored arti@@ ficially , at least until an international agreement reached through a unified system . &quot;
&quot; re@@ agents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities , that the re@@ agent in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells . &quot;
the quantity in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has written records on all stages of production and controls of re@@ agents for blood group determination .
&quot; appropriate rehear@@ s@@ als of all re@@ agents are to be kept from the laboratory for a long time , until some lik@@ el@@ ihood can be assumed that the batch is no longer used . &quot;
&quot; re@@ agents used for blood group determination can contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective part , the others are the necessary aids to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain the stability of the re@@ agent . &quot;
&quot; for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are classified according to the origin of their active part in three groups . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain only substances of human origin , or that animal or plant re@@ agents cannot contain substances of human origin . &quot;

&quot; whereas for the Member States of the European Economic Community the obligation to grant this liberation to the jurisdiction of the community falls , which , according to the agreement , has been established by whom it has the necessary powers ; &quot;
&quot; from this point on , a state cannot become a contracting party of the Convention without becoming the contracting party of the Additional Protocol . &quot;
&quot; the Secretary General of the Council of Europe notes the Member States of the Council of Europe , all states assigned to the Convention and the European Economic Community of any acceptance or objection in the sense of Article 2 , as well as the date of the entry into force of this additional protocol in accordance with Article 2 . &quot;

&quot; in the weighing that it is appropriate to simplify the handling of goods between the Community and EF@@ TA countries as well as between the individual EF@@ TA countries , in particular by introducing a uniform management document , &quot;
&quot; in the discretion of this Convention , it shall not be con@@ stru@@ ed to include the contracting parties from their obligations arising from other international conventions . &quot;
&quot; in this agreement , measures are set to simplify the flow of goods between the Community and the EF@@ TA countries and between the individual EF@@ TA countries ; in particular , a unified management paper ( herein@@ after referred to as herein@@ after referred to as herein@@ after referred to as &quot; &quot; shipping method &quot; &quot; ) is introduced . &quot;
the contractual obligations associated with the goods traffic between the contracting parties are gro@@ unded by means of a uni@@ denti@@ cide for which preliminary prints are to be used in Anne@@ x I to this Convention .
&quot; depending on the case , the document paper is used as an application or paper for export , shipping or import . &quot;
&quot; - to carry out the legal provisions in force in accordance with the contracting party , whose application would not be guaranteed with the sole use of the uni@@ formity . &quot;
&quot; - to be required by the parties involved , so that they may be eligible for the enjoyment of a part or a certain relief . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This convention hin@@ ders the contractual parties not to apply simplified procedures , even using data processing , with regard to further facil@@ itation for the parties involved . &quot;

&quot; under H@@ IN@@ WE@@ IS DA@@ RA@@ U@@ F that , from its cultivation , depend on the existence and standard of living of millions of families , which in turn are entirely dependent on the measures necessary to maintain and extend the consumption of olive products in the producer countries themselves and in non @-@ generating consumer countries ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to DA@@ RA@@ U@@ F , olive oil and table oli@@ ve@@ forms represent essential substances in the areas where olive growing is common ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to DA@@ RA@@ U@@ F that the essential feature of olive production is the ir@@ regul@@ arity of harv@@ ests and market supply and that this leads to fluctuations in production , prices and export revenues , as well as to very different producer revenues ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to DA@@ RA@@ U@@ F that this causes all the particular difficulties which the interests of producers and consumers seriously harm and je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze the general policy of economic growth in the countries , which are in zones where the olive growing is common ; &quot;

( D ) to investigate and facilitate the use of the necessary measures in respect of the other products of the olive tree ;
&quot; III ) to reduce the production costs of the products made from it , in particular the olive oil , in order to improve the position of this oil on the overall market for cur@@ able vegetable oils , &quot;
&quot; IV ) to improve the situation of the olive industry with respect to the environment in accordance with the recommendations of the United Nations Conference on the Environment of Man , in order to remedy possible har@@ ass@@ ment ; &quot;
