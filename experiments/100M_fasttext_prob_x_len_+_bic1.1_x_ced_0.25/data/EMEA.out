this document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the application of the drug .
&quot; if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the package leaf@@ let ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you would like further information on the basis of the recommendations of the CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as a 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg , and 30 mg tablets , 10 mg , 15 mg , and 30 mg of processed tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution for intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. wir@@ ls thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( listening or seeing things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , a psych@@ ic disorder where patients alternate man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal mood ) alternating with periods of normal mood . &quot;
abili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and for the prevention of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the drug in the past .
the injection solution is used for fast control of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders when the oral intake of the drug is not possible .
&quot; in both diseases , the solution can be used for inser@@ ting or the melting tablets for patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time , which are broken down as well as Abi@@ li@@ fy , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; this im@@ pairs the signal transmission between brain cells through &quot; &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters &quot; , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of nerve cells to each other . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is probably mainly known as a &quot; partial ag@@ ony &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but in a lesser degree than the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter works to activate the recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; as dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , thereby reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing their recur@@ rence . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy , which prevents recur@@ rence of symptoms , was studied in three studies of up to one year . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases that suffered from increased un@@ rest , over a period of two hours with a placebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo to prevent recur@@ rence , to 160 patients in which the man@@ ic symptoms were already stabili@@ zed with Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study of 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that suffered from increased un@@ rest with that of Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
&quot; in all studies , the change in the symptoms of patients was examined using a standard dial for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment . &quot;
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the enam@@ el tablets and the solution for absor@@ bing ( recording ) .
&quot; in both studies with the injection solution , patients who received Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg received significantly greater anxiety than the patients receiving placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the application for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy was more effective than placebo in four of the five short @-@ term studies of man@@ ic symptoms . &quot;
&quot; moreover , up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo , Abi@@ li@@ fy prevented the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and when administered in addition to an existing treatment . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 mg doses were also more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased un@@ rest and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy ( observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disorders ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , drow@@ sin@@ ess ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , drow@@ sin@@ ess ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of Abi@@ li@@ fy in treating schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in patients with predominantly man@@ ic episodes , and in which the man@@ ic episodes discussed the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to the risks . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the Committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of injection solution in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , if oral therapy is not appropriate , compared to the risks . &quot;
&quot; in June 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . a permit for the placing of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the entire European Union . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients with predominantly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes related to treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at an maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once a day regardless of meals .
&quot; increased efficacy in doses above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose . &quot;
&quot; the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , independent of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; with regard to the greater sensitivity of these patients , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induction is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic disorders and aff@@ ective disorders , and was reported in some cases after onset or after a change of anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in case of treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that there was no increased risk of suicide using Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole versus other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics in patients with bi@@ polar disorder .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including ac@@ cel@@ eri@@ zed and malign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
3 L@@ ate dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials which lasted a year or less there were occasional reports about during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole occ@@ uring dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia .
&quot; if symptoms and symptoms of a late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occur with Abi@@ li@@ fy , should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a M@@ NS or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including Abi@@ li@@ fy , must be removed . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in cases related to sei@@ zur@@ es . &quot;
&quot; ( 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psych@@ oses associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole had an increased risk of dying compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; however , there were in one of these studies , a study of fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti @-@ psych@@ otic agents , including Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events associated with Abi@@ li@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti @-@ psych@@ otic agents who allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ ses , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gy and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should regularly be monitored with regard to deterioration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is required when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with over@@ lying side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist family , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is not considered clin@@ ically relevant . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with healthy subjects , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and Par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar doses should be made . &quot;
&quot; with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ isers , the joint application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive metabol@@ isers . &quot;
considering the common gift of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with Abi@@ li@@ fy the potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient .
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; after replacing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be increased to the dose level prior to the onset of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are administered together with Abi@@ li@@ fy can be expected with a moderate rise in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
&quot; in clinical trials doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no significant effect on the metabol@@ ites of the sub@@ strates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ met@@ amorph@@ an / 3 method xy@@ morph@@ ine ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pr@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ met@@ amorph@@ an ) . &quot;
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
this drug may not be used in pregnancy due to the insufficient data base for safety in humans and due to the concerns generated in reproductive studies during animal studies unless the potential benefits clearly justify the potential risk of the fet@@ us .
&quot; however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned of serving dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on them . &quot;
the following adverse events were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) compared to placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : common ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; schiz@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study over 52 weeks , patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a total lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia compared to patients treated with hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % was 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 15.@@ 1 % in patients with op@@ i@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; in a controlled study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 2@@ 3,5 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol treatment . &quot;
&quot; in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo . &quot;
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
&quot; increases of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; side effects reported in connection with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , and their occurrence as reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole include malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia and var@@ ic@@ ose attacks , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies and since the market launch , un@@ intended or deliber@@ ate acute over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death . &quot;
&quot; although there is no information on the efficacy of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of over@@ dose because Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma level binding . &quot;
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated via the combination of a partial @-@ agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
&quot; in vitro , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a high aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 receptor and a moderate aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , for ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , for alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor . &quot;
&quot; with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in dos@@ ages ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks to healthy subjects , the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction of the binding of 11@@ C rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ ands , at the Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and on the put@@ file . &quot;
&quot; in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo . &quot;
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled trial in week 52 the proportion of respon@@ der patients receiving a response to the study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
&quot; current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study targets , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - depression rates , showed significantly greater improvement than in hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks on stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was significantly reduced in the rate of rel@@ ap@@ se , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % under placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an op@@ ium @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , less patients experienced a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca . ) . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a efficacy against placebo over 3 weeks compared to placebo . &quot;
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial more than 3 weeks with a fixed dose with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole versus placebo did not show superior efficacy .
&quot; in two placebo and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a efficacy compared to placebo in week 3 and an explan@@ atory effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 . &quot;
&quot; moreover , in week 12 Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of man@@ ia like lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , which in some cases did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ar mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum concentrations , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabil@@ isation phase prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar retreat , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se in man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; based on in vitro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for Deh@@ ydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ agulation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ yl@@ ation is cataly@@ sed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
the mean elimination of elimination is approximately 75 hours for ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole with extensive metabol@@ ites over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and at approximately 146 hours in &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ isers using C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , and in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients no gender dependent effects were observed . &quot;
a non @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics gave no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences regarding the eth@@ ni@@ city or the impact of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy subjects .
&quot; a single dose study in subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( child @-@ pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity . &quot;
&quot; the prec@@ lin@@ ical data , based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , did not allow the prec@@ lin@@ ical data to detect any particular danger for the human being . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions , which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , thus only limited or no meaning for clinical use . &quot;
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent side @-@ kidney toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pig@@ ment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ ma @-@ cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at a recommended maximum dose of 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 10 times the mean Ste@@ ady State Ex@@ pos@@ ure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
&quot; in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was observed as a result of the precip@@ itation of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , the concentrations found in the human bile at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 m@@ g. of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study more than 39 weeks in the g@@ all of monkeys , and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro sol@@ ubil@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 times the mid @-@ size Ste@@ ady State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

15 L@@ ate dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials which lasted a year or less there were occasional reports about during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole occ@@ uring dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated via the combination of a partial @-@ agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .

the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is 10 or 15 mg / day at an maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once a day regardless of meals .
&quot; patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing of Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets , may use the tray tablets as an alternative to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic disorders and aff@@ ective disorders was reported in some cases after onset or after changing an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy also in case of treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .

&quot; M@@ NS &apos;s clinical manifestations are high fever , muscle rigi@@ dity , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;

&quot; the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , independent of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have already received Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the therapy should be continued with the same dose . &quot;

it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated via the combination of a partial @-@ agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .

97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial more than 3 weeks with a fixed dose with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole versus placebo did not show superior efficacy .
&quot; in a relative bio @-@ availability study comparing the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in tablet form for healthy subjects , the ratio between the geometric C@@ MA@@ x mean value of the solution and the value of tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) . &quot;
99 Fur@@ ther@@ more a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was observed as a result of the precip@@ itation of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 times the mid @-@ size Ste@@ ady State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;
&quot; Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution is used for fast control of ag@@ gi@@ bility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if oral therapy is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; once clin@@ ically appropriate , treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution should be terminated and commen@@ ced with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; to increase the resor@@ ption and minimize the vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended under circum@@ vention of adi@@ p@@ ous regions . &quot;
&quot; a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0,@@ 7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status , taking into account the medicine used for maintenance or acute therapy ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; if an oral oral treatment is indicated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , see the summary of the features of the drug to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets , Abi@@ li@@ fy melt tablets or Abi@@ li@@ fy solution . &quot;
there are no studies on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution in patients with ast@@ er@@ iness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders that were different from schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
&quot; if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution , patients should be monitored with extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
studies on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including ac@@ cel@@ eri@@ zed and malign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials which lasted a year or less there were occasional reports about during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole occ@@ uring dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia .
&quot; M@@ NS &apos;s clinical manifestations are high fever , stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness , and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ ses , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gy and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should regularly be monitored with regard to deterioration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the intensity of the se@@ d@@ ation was greater compared to that of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study in which healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 15 mg dosage ) was administered intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly in healthy volunteers , and simultaneously received the lau@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dosage ) intra@@ muscular . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist family , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is not considered clin@@ ically relevant . &quot;
&quot; with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ isers , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - Prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; after replacing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be increased to the dose level prior to the onset of the accompanying therapy . &quot;

the following adverse events were more common in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
&quot; the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
107 The following adverse events occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) compared to placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( see section 5.1 ) :
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % was for patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo . &quot;
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
&quot; increases of CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; side effects reported in connection with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , and their occurrence as reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole include malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia and var@@ ic@@ ose attacks , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution associated with statisti@@ cally significant improvement in behavi@@ our@@ al / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and was similar to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as det@@ ox and behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in terms of ag@@ ility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm . &quot;
&quot; the mean improvement observed at the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score at the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5.@@ 8 for placebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe a@@ gi@@ ti@@ bility , a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the overall population , but a statistical significance could be detected because of a decreased number of patients . &quot;
&quot; in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) compared to placebo was a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms . &quot;
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled trial in week 52 the proportion of respon@@ der patients receiving a response to the study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
&quot; current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study targets , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depression rates , showed significantly greater improvement than in hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks on stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a significantly higher reduction in the rate of rel@@ ap@@ se , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) group and 57 % under placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an op@@ ium @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , less patients experienced a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca . ) . &quot;
&quot; 111 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , which in some cases did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ar mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum concentrations , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole revealed a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a 74 week extension in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabil@@ isation phase prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar retreat , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se in man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole AU@@ C is 90 % greater the AU@@ C after administration of the same dose as a tablet ; systemic exposure was similar to the two form@@ ulations . &quot;
&quot; in 2 studies with healthy subjects , the mean time until reaching the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after use . &quot;
&quot; the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated administration in systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , the 15 and 5 times over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intra@@ muscular . &quot;
in studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity following IV application there were no safety @-@ relevant concerns after mat@@ ernal exposure to 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
&quot; based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential the prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not reveal any particular danger to humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions , which exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans ; therefore , they have limited or no meaning for clinical use . &quot;
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent side @-@ kidney toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pig@@ ment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ ma cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 60 mg / kg / day ( 10 times the mean steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
&quot; in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was observed as a result of the precip@@ itation of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of 3- and 11 @-@ times the mean steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

&quot; the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study where 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer participated , of which about three quarters of which previously had an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine . &quot;
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole administration or as a mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the medication containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
&quot; in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of 2@@ 29 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane responded to the treatment compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients receiving conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; considering only the patients who were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between the efficacy indicators such as time to deterioration of the disease and survival . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
it may also not be used in patients who are breast@@ feeding or at the beginning of treatment low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) found that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective in patients with the first treatment being more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel and that in contrast to other pac@@ lit@@ axel chemotherapy drugs should not be given with other medicines to reduce side effects .
&quot; January 2008 , the European Commission granted the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited a permit for the placing of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients in which the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease has failed and is not indicated for a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils &lt; 0.@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of a week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in the following series .
&quot; in sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy degrees 3 , the treatment should be interrupted until an improvement is reached to grade 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles , the dose must be reduced . &quot;
there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustment in patients with mild to moderate reduction in liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies were conducted with patients with impaired ren@@ al function and there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustment in patients with impaired ren@@ al function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to insufficient data on harm@@ lessness and effectiveness .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ articles formulation of pac@@ lit@@ axel that could have significantly different pharmac@@ ological features than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ axel ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
&quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be immediately removed and a symptom@@ atic treatment is initiated , and the patient must not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ axel again . &quot;
&quot; in the patients no renewed Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated , until the neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ ous number has risen again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the plat@@ el@@ et number has risen again &gt; 100 x 109 / l . &quot;
patients with severe liver function disorders ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; while a cy@@ an@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity clearly associated with Abra@@ x@@ ane is not proven , cardiac events are not unusual in the indicated patient population , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart disease or lung disease . &quot;
&quot; if in patients with the administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea , these can be treated with the usual anti@@ ques and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating methods . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used for pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age , which are not effective contrac@@ eption , except the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ axel is unavoid@@ able . &quot;
women in child@@ bearing age should apply a reliable contrac@@ eption method during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised , during and up to six months after the treatment , no child can testify . &quot;
male patients should be advised against a sperm conservation before treatment because the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as ti@@ redness ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( frequent ) that can affect the transport efficiency and the ability to operate machinery .
the following are the most common and most important incidents of side effects that occurred in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the pi@@ vot@@ al phase III trial .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most conspic@@ uous important ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
&quot; in Table 1 , the side effects associated with the administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy have occurred in each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10 ) . &quot;
&quot; occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ atine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease : &quot;
&quot; dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gic , flat@@ ul@@ ence , tongue burning , dry mouth , painful g@@ ums , loose stools , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , sor@@ es in the mouth , oral pain , rec@@ tal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and ur@@ inary tract : &quot;
&quot; pain in the thor@@ ac@@ ic wall , weakness of mus@@ cul@@ ature , neck pain , pain in skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature , back pain , discomfort in limbs , muscle weakness Very frequent : &quot;
&quot; rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive , related case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients &quot;
&quot; as these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual incidence are possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events was established . &quot;
pac@@ lit@@ axel is an anti @-@ cryp@@ to@@ ot@@ ub@@ ules compound that promotes the transfer of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ bul@@ ations and stabili@@ zes mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by blocking their dep@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network that is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in medi@@ ates the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into the end@@ otheli@@ al cells and in the context of in @-@ vitro studies it has been demonstrated that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ axel by end@@ otheli@@ al cells .
it is believed that this improved trans@@ sen@@ d@@ otheli@@ al transport is convey@@ ed by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ alb@@ um@@ re@@ zep@@ tor and a pac@@ lit@@ axel accumulation in the area of the tumor occurs due to the alb@@ um@@ bi protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two single @-@ arm un@@ connected studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ized Phase III comparative study .
&quot; in one study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion for 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion for 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer . &quot;
&quot; this multi@@ center study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer , which received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ axel within 3 weeks , either in the form of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel 175 mg / m2 , or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 , as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ meditation ( N = 2@@ 29 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study , 64 % of patients had a com@@ promised general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases . &quot;
&quot; 14 % of patients had previously not received chemotherapy , 27 % had only one adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metasta@@ sis and 19 % due to metasta@@ sis and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment . &quot;
9 The results for overall response rate and time to progression @-@ free survival and progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients who receive &gt; First @-@ Line therapy are below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared with pac@@ lit@@ axel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy degree 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy towards the conclusion of bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the overall pac@@ lit@@ axel after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
&quot; the Ex@@ pos@@ ure Ex@@ pos@@ ure ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml , an@@ alog@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; 10 After IV administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ axel plastic concentration decreased in a multi@@ phase manner . &quot;
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates far @-@ reaching extra@@ vascular distribution and / or soft binding of pac@@ lit@@ axel .
in a study with patients with advanced solid tumours the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ axel were compared with intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent @-@ containing pac@@ lit@@ axel .
&quot; the Clear@@ ance of Pac@@ lit@@ axel was higher ( 43 % ) following a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel injection , and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) . &quot;
in published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers it is reported that pac@@ lit@@ axel is primarily met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and to two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ d@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ) .
&quot; after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative urine ex@@ cre@@ tion was 4 % of the total dose of 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel , indicating a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearing . &quot;
&quot; however , only a few data are available about patients aged over 75 years since only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis . &quot;
chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and light @-@ light protected over 8 hours .

member states must ensure that the owner of the per@@ missions for placing on the market is provided by medical professionals in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail pharmac@@ ies with the following information and materials :
&quot; • Training brochure • summary of the features of the drug ( specialist information ) , labelling and packaging inserts . &quot;
&quot; this means that ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological medicine approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active ingredient ( also called &quot; &quot; reference resin agents &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in patients with normal blood flow values , in which complications may occur in connection with blood trans@@ fusion , if bleeding is not possible before the procedure and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a doctor , who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases indicated for the medicine . &quot;
&quot; in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a blood donation , Ab@@ bad@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a vein . &quot;
&quot; the injection can also be done by the patient or his car@@ egi@@ ver , provided that they have given appropriate guidance . &quot;
&quot; in patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients receiving chemotherapy , hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) . &quot;
&quot; the iron values of all patients are to be controlled before the treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency exists , and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia can be caused by an ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ etal deficiency or that the body does not respond adequately to the body &apos;s ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced to the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
&quot; in the course of a major study with 4@@ 79 patients suffering from kidney problems , Ab@@ bad@@ amed was compared with the reference drug . &quot;
&quot; in all patients participating in this study , E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o was inj@@ ected into a vein for at least eight weeks before they were either switched to ab@@ se@@ amed or still received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of ab@@ se@@ amed under the skin were studied with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
&quot; in the study with patients suffering from kidney problems , ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values were maintained to the same degree as those patients who still received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , patients who still received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the starting value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effect of Ab@@ bad@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which may occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , st@@ inging mig@@ ra@@ ine headaches and confusion . &quot;
ab@@ se@@ amed may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
amed as inj@@ ections under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems as further studies are required to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions .
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for ab@@ se@@ amed according to the provisions of the European Union , evidence has been provided that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the company that produces ab@@ se@@ amed will provide information packages for medical professionals in all member states , including information on the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in August 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Medi@@ ce Medic@@ aid P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co . kg for the placing of ab@@ se@@ amed across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion demand in adults with solid tumours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ omas , or multiple my@@ el@@ oma , which receive chemotherapy and in which the risk of trans@@ fusion is due to the general condition ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ emia at the start of chemotherapy ) . &quot;
&quot; treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6,@@ 2 - 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , in case of planned larger surgical interventions ( 4 or more units blood in women ; 5 or more units blood in men ) . &quot;

hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) except for pedi@@ atric patients with ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; an@@ aes@@ th@@ esia symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and total disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition is required by the doctor . &quot;
an increase in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
&quot; due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values can be observed on or below the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration . &quot;
&quot; given this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to reach the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose required for controlling an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ a@@ emia .
the clinical results suggest that patients with a very low H@@ b ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
the clinical results suggest that patients with a very low H@@ b ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .

&quot; symptoms of an@@ emia and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and total disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition is required by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; given this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to reach the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose required for controlling an@@ emia .
&quot; if after 4 weeks of the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the recur@@ rence number ≥ 40.000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the bas@@ eline , the dose should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week . &quot;
&quot; if the increase in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the recur@@ rence rate of &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l is increased compared to the bas@@ eline , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week . &quot;
&quot; if after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the recur@@ rence number increased by ≥ 40.000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose should be maintained three times a week . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the recur@@ rence number increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , is an indication of the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy unlikely and the treatment should be canc@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood c@@ anned foods is required , should be given twice weekly for 3 weeks before surgery . &quot;
iron sub@@ stitution should be started as early as possible - for example a few weeks prior to the start of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program - in order to provide large iron reserves before the start of the se@@ amed treatment .
&quot; the recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ E. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this case , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be given pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg to 10 consecutive days , on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula needle , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rinse the hose and ensure adequate injection of the drug to the circulation . &quot;
&quot; patients suffering from the treatment with any ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pla@@ sia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive ab@@ se@@ amed or other ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin ( see Section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ia ) . &quot;
&quot; heart attack or stroke within a month prior to treatment , unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep vein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ n@@ esia @-@ known ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ ils ) . &quot;
&quot; the use of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in patients who are unable to participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program : severe coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease , peripheral arter@@ ial oc@@ clu@@ sion , vascular disease of the cardi@@ oti@@ des or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with recently occurred heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular event . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare has been reported about the occurrence of an anti@@ body @-@ medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; in patients with sudden loss of effect , defined as reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the reprodu@@ ci@@ bility should be determined and the usual causes for a failure ( iron , fol@@ ate or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , al@@ umin@@ escence intoxic@@ ation , infections or inflammation , blood loss and ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis ) are examined . &quot;
&quot; if the recur@@ rence rate , taking into account an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cytes &quot; index &quot; ) , is low ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row should be considered for the diagnosis of a PR@@ CA . &quot;
data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk of an anti @-@ body induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
&quot; 8 In patients with chronic kidney failure , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration in Section 4.2 . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies , increased mortality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating active substances ( ESA ) were given with a ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of more than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
controlled clinical trials have shown no significant benefit to the administration of epo@@ et@@ ins when the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration required to control the an@@ emia and the avoid@@ ance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the increase in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in should be about 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure .
&quot; in patients with chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically evident coron@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive heart disease , maintenance therapy should not be exceeded in Section 4.2 , the upper limit of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration . &quot;
&quot; according to present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which is not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
&quot; in tumour patients under chemotherapy , an 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa drugs and ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin response should be taken into account for the assessment of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa &apos;s therapeutic efficiency . &quot;
&quot; if the H@@ b increase is exceeded than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of Pati@@ ents with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ a@@ emia - dose adjustment with the aim of keeping the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) . &quot;
the decision to use re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk balance taking into account the patient &apos;s involvement which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
&quot; in patients who are intended for larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , if possible , prior to the onset of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa drugs , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia is examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; patients who undergo a greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic procedure should receive adequate th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis pro@@ phyla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , especially in case of underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it cannot be excluded that for patients with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an initial hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of &gt; 13 g / dl , there is an increased risk of postoperative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic / vascular events . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled studies , epo@@ et@@ ine did not prove that patients with symptom@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia improve overall survival or reduce the risk of tumour progression . &quot;
&quot; 4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy , hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration was targeted at 12 @-@ 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in@@ dosage can be adjusted to the increasing ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies on tumor tissues , there is no indication of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F regarding hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation . &quot;
&quot; th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial isch@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ coma , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , cardiac inf@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis . &quot;
the most common side effect during the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or worsen@@ ing of an existing hypertension .
an increased incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ vas@@ cul@@ ars ( see Section 4.4 and Section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients treated with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ins .
&quot; regardless of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations to th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications . &quot;
&quot; the derived epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ si@@ ated and , in terms of the amino acids and carbohydr@@ ate content , is identical to the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , which was isolated from the urine of an@@ em@@ ic patients . &quot;
it could be demonstrated using cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .
&quot; 3@@ 89 patients with hem@@ o@@ bla@@ stom@@ as ( 2@@ 21 multiple my@@ el@@ omas , 144 non @-@ Ho@@ d@@ g@@ kin@@ - lymph@@ omas and 24 other hem@@ o@@ bla@@ stom@@ as ) and 3@@ 32 patients with solid tumours ( 172 breast carcin@@ omas , 23 gastro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas , 21 gastro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas , 21 gastro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas , and 30 others ) . &quot;

survival and progression were studied in five major controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials and
&quot; in the open study , there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and patients . &quot;
&quot; in these studies , patients with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treated patients with an@@ a@@ emia in a consistent , statisti@@ cally significantly higher mortality rate than in controls . &quot;
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis and associated complications with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treated patients and in controls .
&quot; there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ical events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be ruled out . &quot;
it is not clear how far these results are transferred to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumour patients who are treated with chemotherapy with the aim of transferring a ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value under 13 g / dl as too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa provisions after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a slightly extended half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
&quot; after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than serum levels that are achieved following IV injection . &quot;
&quot; there is no cum@@ ulation : the serum levels remain the same , regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift . &quot;
( bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic kidney failure in humans and could be attributed to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
in a study of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients who were treated three years with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
&quot; 14 In animal experimental studies with approximately the 20@@ x of the recommended weekly dose , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , reduced to reduced fö@@ ld body weight , led to a delay in Os@@ si@@ fication and an increase in fet@@ al mortality . &quot;
these reports are based on in vitro findings with cells from human tumor tissue samples which are of uncertain significance for the clinical situation .

the treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of doctors who have experience in treating patients with the above indications .
&quot; the recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ E. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;

&quot; according to the &quot; CH@@ MP Guid@@ eline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal use , &quot; an updated R@@ MP should be provided at the same time with the next updated report on the harm@@ lessness of the drug ( Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report , P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • when receiving new information that may have influence on the current safety specifications ( safety speci@@ fication ) , the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or the measures to reduce risk reduction • within 60 days after reaching an important ( drug vi@@ gil@@ ance or risk reduction ) &quot;
&quot; • In a month before your treatment have suffered a heart attack or stroke • If you suffer from unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time or increased chest pain ) , the risk of coron@@ ary th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis in the veins ( deep vein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis ) has occurred - if for example , such a drop of blood has occurred . &quot;
&quot; you suffer from severe bleeding disturbances of the heart ( coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) , arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial oc@@ clu@@ sion ) , the cervical vessels ( vascular disease of the cardi@@ oti@@ des ) or the brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) you have recently had a heart attack or stroke . &quot;
&quot; during the treatment with Ab@@ bad@@ amed , it may occur within the normal range to a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets , which is re@@ formed during further treatment . &quot;
your doctor will possibly perform regular blood tests to check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets regularly during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
&quot; iron deficiency , dis@@ integration of red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or fo@@ lic acid deficiency should be considered and treated with ab@@ se@@ amed prior to start of therapy . &quot;
&quot; very rarely , ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ ia was reported after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( spra@@ yed under the skin ) ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ ia , it will ab@@ ort your therapy with ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated . &quot;
&quot; therefore , sever@@ ity must be given by injection into a vein ( intraven@@ ously ) if you are treated for an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease . &quot;
a high ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value may be the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
&quot; in case of elevated or rising potassium levels , your doctor may consider an inter@@ ruption of treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium levels are back in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically open coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease or con@@ ges@@ tion signs due to insufficient heart performance , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror does not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which is not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ administration and the desired effect should be taken into account for assessing the effectiveness of Ab@@ bad@@ amed .
200 your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) and adjust your se@@ amed dose accordingly to minimize the risk of a blood drop formation ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic event ) as low as possible .
&quot; this risk should be carefully weighed against the advantages derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e or if th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events have occurred in the past ( e.g. a deep vein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bol@@ ism ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are a cancer patient , remember that ab@@ se@@ amed can act as a growth factor for blood cells and , under certain circumstances , can adver@@ sely affect the tumor . &quot;
&quot; if a major orthop@@ a@@ edic operation is about to happen , you should check the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia before the start of the treatment and treat it accordingly . &quot;
&quot; if your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get Ab@@ bad@@ amed because there is an increased risk of bleeding after the surgery . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medicines / apply it recently , even if it is not prescription . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means of suppression of the immune system ) during your therapy with ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may , if necessary , arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
laboratory tests have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F ) to build the immune system ( e.g. cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) .
&quot; depending on how your an@@ a@@ emia affects the treatment , the dose can be adjusted for approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control . &quot;
your doctor will be able to arrange regular blood tests if necessary to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that the medicine works properly and does not exceed your ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value .
&quot; once you are well set , regular doses of se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg are given twice weekly , distributed on two equally large inj@@ ections . &quot;
your doctor will arrange regular blood tests if necessary to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that your ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
&quot; depending on how an@@ a@@ emia responds to treatment , the dose can be adjusted for approximately every four weeks until the condition is under control . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure that the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the attending physician will perform regular blood tests . &quot;
&quot; if necessary to shor@@ ten the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given to 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of surgery and another 4 days after surgery . &quot;
&quot; however , if your doctor considers this to be appropriate , you can also learn how to inj@@ ure Ab@@ bad@@ amed himself among the skin . &quot;

A@@ cla@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
&quot; it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( bone frac@@ tures ) , including patients who recently suffered a low trau@@ matic frac@@ ture like the H@@ inf@@ all ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) before the first in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means of inflammation ) shortly after the application of A@@ cla@@ sta can reduce the symptoms occurring in the three days following the in@@ fusion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache . &quot;
&quot; to treat the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease . &quot;
&quot; as the active ingredient in A@@ cla@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , nearly 8@@ ,000 elderly women were involved in oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of spinal and frac@@ ture frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , who recently suffered a frac@@ ture frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years was examined . &quot;
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta was tested in two studies with a total of 35@@ 7 patients and compared with the Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of the efficacy was whether the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ ate content in the serum ( an enzyme , which decreases bone substance ) in the blood again norm@@ alized or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the bas@@ eline value . &quot;
&quot; in the study with older women , the risk of spinal frac@@ tures in patients under A@@ cla@@ sta ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis therapy ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; compared to all patients under A@@ cla@@ sta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis therapy ) , the risk of frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % . &quot;
in the study with men and women with hip frac@@ ture 9 % of patients under A@@ chi@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of A@@ cla@@ sta occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
A@@ cla@@ sta may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with A@@ cla@@ sta are liable to the risk of kidney problems , in@@ fusion and oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( death of bone tissue ) in the jaw . &quot;
A@@ cla@@ sta manufacturers provide clari@@ fication material for physicians who prescri@@ be A@@ cla@@ sta to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis as well as similar material for patients where the side effects of the drug are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor .
&quot; April 2005 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited a permit for the transport of A@@ cla@@ sta across the European Union . &quot;

&quot; treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic frac@@ ture frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; the patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include : • The package supplement • Con@@ trac@@ ting of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When treating to medical or nursing assistance &quot;
&quot; treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis • in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recently reported low @-@ trau@@ matic frac@@ ture frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , an intraven@@ ous 5 mg A@@ cla@@ sta IV in@@ fusion is recommended once a year . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic frac@@ ture frac@@ ture , the administration of the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta is recommended two or more weeks following the operative care of the frac@@ ture frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get . &quot;
&quot; following a treatment by the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cla@@ sta , a long period of re@@ mission was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , equivalent to at least 500 mg of elementary calcium per day , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the first A@@ chi@@ sta in@@ fusion . &quot;
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta can be reduced by adding par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of A@@ cla@@ sta .
patients with kidney dysfunction ( see Section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min A@@ cla@@ sta is not recommended as limited clinical experience for this patient group is available .
&quot; older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary because bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients . &quot;
children and young people A@@ pu@@ sta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age because data on safety and efficacy is missing .
A@@ cla@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because only limited clinical experience is available for this patient population .
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is to be treated with an adequate supply of calcium and vitamin D before starting the treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; due to rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , equivalent to at least 500 mg of elementary calcium per day , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; cancer , chemotherapy , cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene should be considered before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate preventive dental treatment . &quot;
&quot; for patients who need dental implants , no data is available to reduce the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area . &quot;
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of A@@ cla@@ sta can be reduced by adding par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of serious adverse events reported in atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation was increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3.@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
&quot; in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between A@@ cla@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable . &quot;
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) are listed in table 1 . &quot;
&quot; ren@@ al dysfunction Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid was associated with kidney dysfunction , which expressed itself as a decrease in the kidney function ( i.e. an increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure . &quot;
the change in the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before the administration ) and the occurrence of ren@@ al failure and a limited ren@@ al function were comparable in a clinical trial for oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years comparable to the A@@ cla@@ sta@@ - and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of administration was observed in 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ va compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium levels , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation area ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , were compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta in the patients &quot; mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get trials . &quot;
&quot; all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a frac@@ ture frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recently reported hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions following the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in a large clinical study were reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion site , such as redness , swelling and / or pain ( 0.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis was reported in the jaw area , especially in cancer patients , via oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( primarily in the jaw area ) that were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid . &quot;
&quot; many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis , and the majority of reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental intervention . &quot;
&quot; 7 study of 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ o@@ arthritis in the jaw area with one with A@@ cla@@ sta and a patient treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , which leads to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a balance can be achieved by offering oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous cal@@ ci@@ um@@ glu@@ con@@ at intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion . &quot;
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cla@@ sta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women between 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density value ≤ -@@ 1.5 and at least two mild or moderate @-@ sized verteb@@ rate frac@@ ture ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing ed@@ dy body frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ ometric verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures A@@ cla@@ va decreased significantly over a period of three years and after a year the incidence of one or more new verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures ( see Table 2 ) .
A@@ cla@@ sta treated patients from 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of spinal frac@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
&quot; effects on hip frac@@ tures A@@ cla@@ sta showed an equally lasting effect over three years , resulting in a reduction of 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk for hip frac@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cla@@ sta increased bone density on lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 In@@ cre@@ ased the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the whole hip by 6.@@ 0 % , the lower leg by 5.2 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % . &quot;
&quot; bone hist@@ ology For 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , a year after the third annual dose of oste@@ opor@@ osis was taken from the pel@@ vic ridge . &quot;
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in the tra@@ be@@ cular bone volume compared to placebo and the tra@@ be@@ cular bone architecture .
&quot; bone replacement markers The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal Pro@@ pe@@ p@@ tide of the type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum was determined in sub @-@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients during study duration . &quot;
&quot; after 12 months , the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose A@@ chi@@ sta significantly reduced B@@ SAP by 30 % compared to the initial value and was held at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months . &quot;
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the starting value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
&quot; the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. oral or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion . &quot;
the overall mortality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with A@@ cla@@ sta compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
&quot; effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , the A@@ cla@@ sta treatment increased the BM@@ D compared to placebo treatment at all times . &quot;
&quot; after 24 months compared to placebo , the A@@ cla@@ sta treatment led to an increase in BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % in total and 4.3 % at the lower leg . &quot;
clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ized and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % compared to 8.@@ 7 % compared to placebo .
&quot; in another study by men ( study C@@ ZO@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once annual administration of A@@ cla@@ sta was not inferior to the percentage change of the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e @-@ BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the bas@@ eline value . &quot;
clinical efficacy of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get des Kno@@ chens A@@ cla@@ sta was examined in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically proven ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in accordance with the 2.@@ 6@@ x to 3.@@ 0@@ fold age @-@ specific upper normal value when recording to the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid compared to the intake of 30 mg of Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once daily for 2 months was demonstrated in two six @-@ month comparative studies .
&quot; in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence was observed after 6 months compared to the initial value for A@@ cla@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate . &quot;
patients who were classified as Respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month study could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
&quot; from the 143 with A@@ cla@@ sta and 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response was maintained in 141 of the patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at , compared to 71 of the patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at will be maintained at an average duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after the application . &quot;
&quot; one @-@ off and multiple 5 and 15 minutes continuous in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dose @-@ independent . &quot;
&quot; after that , the plasma levels rapidly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 hours and &lt; 1 % after 24 hours , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase of very low concentration , not more than 0.1 % of the maximum value . &quot;
&quot; rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic disappearance from the large cycle with half @-@ life t ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ to 1,@@ 87 hours , followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination period t ½ g 146 hours . &quot;
the early distribution phases ( α and β ) represent the rapid resor@@ ption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kidneys .
&quot; in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; the total body @-@ clear@@ ance amounts to 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight . &quot;
an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration versus time ) .
&quot; a dimin@@ ished Clear@@ ance by Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 enzymes met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed substances is unlikely because z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid is not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by humans , and because they are a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , substance @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ - &quot;
&quot; special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clear@@ ance of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ atine @-@ Clear@@ ance , and was 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) in the 64 examined patients . &quot;
this results in a light ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate ren@@ al function disorder up to 35 ml / min no dose adjustment of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid is required .
&quot; since severe kidney dysfunction ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) is limited , no statements are possible for this population . &quot;
acute toxic@@ ity The maximum non @-@ therapeutic intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight in mice and at rats 0.@@ 6 mg / kg body weight .
&quot; in dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C ) were given 6@@ x of the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influence . &quot;
&quot; chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intraven@@ ous use , the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was determined in rats using doses of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg as 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose which corresponds to the 7@@ fold of human @-@ therapeutic exposure related to AU@@ C ) , well tolerated . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies with repeated use in cum@@ ulated ex@@ positions that exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects in other organs , including gastro@@ intestinal tract and liver , and intraven@@ ous injection points occurred . &quot;
&quot; the most common infection in studies with repeated use was an increased primary sponge in the Metap@@ hysi@@ sis of the long bone in animals in the growth phase with nearly all dos@@ ages , an infection that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ absor@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance . &quot;
in rats a ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ eity of doses above 0.2 mg / kg was observed as external and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such of the skel@@ eton .
&quot; rab@@ bits did not have ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of the low serum levels of serum levels . &quot;
&quot; if the drug is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and the conditions before the application ; normally , 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded . &quot;

&quot; according to the CH@@ MP directive for risk management systems for human medicine , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot;
&quot; a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information could affect the safety , drug vi@@ gil@@ ance plan or activities to minimize the risk . • Wi@@ thin 60 days when an important milestone ( for drug vi@@ gil@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) was reached . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron Aci@@ d is a representative of a substance class called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , and is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the Pa@@ get of the bone . &quot;
&quot; declining blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens that are formed from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men . &quot;
&quot; in the mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , the bone structure is too fast , and new bone material is set up un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cla@@ sta works by norm@@ alizing bone reconstruction , thereby ensuring normal bone formation and thus rein@@ forces the bone strength again . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; if you use A@@ cla@@ sta with other medicines please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines or used it recently , even if it is not prescription . &quot;
it is particularly important for your doctor to know if you are taking drugs that is known to be damaging the kidneys .
&quot; when using A@@ cla@@ sta along with food and drink , you should be concerned that according to your doctor &apos;s instructions , you should take sufficient liquid before and after treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is administered by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion in a vein .
&quot; if you have recently broken the hips , it is recommended to make the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta two or more weeks following the operational supply of the hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get The usual dose is 5 mg , which is administered by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion in a vein . &quot;
&quot; since A@@ cla@@ sta works for a long time , you may need to take another dose only after a year or longer . &quot;
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium levels in your blood will not be too low in your blood in time after the in@@ fusion .
&quot; with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta can last longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment . &quot;
&quot; if the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta has been missed , you will immediately contact your doctor or hospital to arrange a new appointment . &quot;
&quot; before the end of the treatment with A@@ cla@@ vian In case you are considering the termination of treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta , please take your next doctor appointment and discuss this with your doctor . &quot;
&quot; side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion occur very frequently ( with more than 30 % of the patients ) , but are less frequent after the subsequent in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and headache occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; currently it is unclear whether A@@ pu@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you have received such symptoms after having received A@@ pu@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; physical signs of a too low calcium concentration in the blood , such as muscle cra@@ mps or craw@@ ling or num@@ b feeling , especially in the area around the mouth . &quot;
&quot; flu , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , fatigue , ting@@ ling , nausea , pain in your eyes , pain , swelling , pain in your eyes , pain , swelling , pain in your eyes , chest pain , high blood pressure , redness , it@@ ching , red@@ dish skin , frequent ur@@ ination , temporary up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment of serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins , tissue swelling and thirst . &quot;
persistent pain and / or not cur@@ ative wounds in the mouth or jaw were reported primarily in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates for other diseases .
&quot; an allergic reaction , including rare cases of respiratory problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) has been reported . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the mentioned side effects may neg@@ atively affect you or notice side effects that are not listed in this user information . &quot;
&quot; if the drug is not immediately used , the user is responsible for storage time and conditions until the application ; normally , 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently reported low @-@ trau@@ matic frac@@ ture frac@@ ture , it is recommended to carry out an in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ va two or more weeks following the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; before and after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta , patients must be sufficiently supplied with fluid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic treatment . &quot;
&quot; due to rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic @-@ running , hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , according to at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;

A@@ comp@@ lia is used in addition to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients • who suffer from obesity ( BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above and / or • which are overweight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and additionally one or more
&quot; in addition , four studies were conducted in more than 7 000 patients in which A@@ comp@@ lia was used as a suppor@@ tive remedy for the setting of smoking . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the studies on the setting of smoking showed no uniform results , so that the effect of A@@ comp@@ lia was difficult to assess in this field of application . &quot;
what is the risk associated with A@@ comp@@ lia ? the most common side effects of A@@ comp@@ lia which were observed during the studies ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) were nausea and infections of the upper respiratory tract .
&quot; it may not be applied in patients who suffer from severe depression or are treated with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants , as the risk of depression can increase and , among other things , a small minority of patients may provoke suicide . &quot;
&quot; caution is required while using A@@ comp@@ lia with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or i@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( medication against fung@@ al infections ) , p@@ eli@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or cl@@ ari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the efficacy of A@@ comp@@ lia in terms of weight reduction in patients with obesity or overweight cuts
&quot; medication used in patients who need it for health and not for cosmetic reasons ( by providing clari@@ fication packages for patients and doctors ) , and around the Ar@@ z &quot;
it has an additional diet and exercise for the treatment of obesity ( BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or overweight patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) which also have one or more risk factors such as type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia ( see section 5.1 ) .
A@@ comp@@ lia is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years due to the lack of data on efficacy and safety .
&quot; La Depres@@ sive disorders or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported at up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts for up to 1 % of patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the case of depres@@ sive disorders , Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used unless the benefit of treatment in individual cases out@@ weighs the risk ( see section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; also in patients who - apart from obesity - have no apparent risks , depres@@ sive reactions can occur . &quot;
&quot; relatives or other related persons ) must point out that it is necessary to monitor the new occurrence of such symptoms , and seek immediate medical advice if these symptoms occur . l@@ n &quot;
• El@@ derly patients The efficacy and safety of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years were not shown sufficiently .
patients with a cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke etc . ) occurred less than 6 months ago by studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant . l@@ n

&quot; patients and patients with an obesity have been examined , and in addition to 3@@ 800 patients in further indications . &quot;
the following table ( Table 1 ) shows the adverse effects of placebo @-@ controlled trials in patients suffering from weight loss and related metabolic diseases .
&quot; it was statisti@@ cally significant higher than the corresponding plac@@ eb@@ or@@ ate ( for adverse effects ≥ 1 % ) , or if they were clin@@ ically relevant ( for adverse effects &lt; 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; frequently ( ≥ 1 , &lt; 10 % ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 0.1 , &lt; 1 % ) ; rare ( ≥ 0,@@ 01 , &lt; 0.1 % ) ; very t l@@ ä &quot;
only slight symptoms have been observed in a case study in which a limited number of individuals have given one @-@ time charges of up to 300 mg .
the patients had a BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² or BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² and a simultaneous hyper@@ ton@@ ia and / or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia .
&quot; weight reduction after one year amounted to 6.5 kg for A@@ comp@@ lia 20 mg , relative to 1.6 kg for the placebo group ( difference -@@ 4.@@ 9 kg CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.3 ; -@@ 4,@@ 4 , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients treated with A@@ comp@@ lia 20 mg , and 1.2 kg in the placebo group ( difference -@@ 3.@@ 8 kg ; CI@@ 95 % -@@ 4.4 , -@@ 3,@@ 3 ; p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; after 2 years the difference in total weight reduction between A@@ comp@@ lia and placebo -@@ 4.2 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5,@@ 0 % ; -@@ 3,@@ 4 , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 Wei@@ ght reduction and further risk factors In the studies in patients with no diabetes , in which a mixed population of patients with &quot;
&quot; under Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg , an average decrease of tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des was seen from 6.@@ 9 % ( starting value Tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de 1.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) compared to an increase of 5.@@ 8 % &quot;
&quot; in a second study in patients with obesity and previously untreated type 2 diabetes ( Ser@@ en@@ ade ) , the absolute change in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value ( with a bas@@ eline value of 7.@@ 9 % for both groups ) was 6 months -@@ 0.8 for Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg and -@@ 0.3 of placebo &quot;
the percentage of patients who achieved H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c@@ - value of &lt; 7 % was 51 % in the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant group and 35 % in the placebo group .
&quot; the difference in the mean weight change between the 20 M@@ g@@ - and the placebo group was 3.@@ 8 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5,@@ 0 , -@@ 2.6 p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
improvement of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value in patients who had taken Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg were approximately 50 % due to direct effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant and about 50 % explained by weight reduction . n eim Ar@@ z
&quot; reached 2 hours , the steady state plasma levels were reached after 13 days ( C@@ MA@@ x = 196 ± 28@@ ,@@ 1 ng / ml ; C@@ trou@@ gh = 9@@ 1,6 ± 14.@@ 1 ng / ml ; AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 = 29@@ 60 ± 26@@ 8 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; food influence : it subjects who received the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant either in a state of vom@@ iting or after a fat @-@ rich meal , showed up 67 % higher C@@ MA@@ x or 48 % increased ng AU@@ C in the case of food intake . &quot;
patients with black skin color can have up to 31 % lower C@@ MA@@ x and a 43 % lower AU@@ C than patients of other ethnic populations .
n popular pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analyses ( age range 18@@ - 81 years ) is estimated that a 75 year old patient has a 21 % higher C@@ MA@@ x and a 27 % higher AU@@ C than a 40 @-@ year @-@ old
&quot; 5.3 Pre@@ clinical data on the safety of the following adverse effects not observed in clinical trials , which occurred in animals after exposure to the human therapeutic area , were considered to be relevant for clinical use : &quot;
&quot; in some cases , however , not in all cases , the beginning of con@@ vul@@ sions with proced@@ ural stress appears to be related to dealing with the animals . &quot;
&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period prior to mat@@ ing ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , so no adverse effects on fertility or cycle disorders were observed . &quot;
the effect of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was studied at the rat in dos@@ ages of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
&quot; in a study of rats for pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development , exposure to Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and through lac@@ tation did not cause changes in learning behavior or memory . &quot;

&quot; summary of the EP@@ AR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the application of the drug . &quot;
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially obes@@ e patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes medicine ) can not be indicated .
it can be used in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially obes@@ e patients ) who cannot be satisfied with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl res@@ ins or insulin , the current dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl res@@ ins and insulin can be maintained with the onset of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of sul@@ fon@@ yl res@@ ins and insulin should be reduced . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases , making type 2 diabetes better . &quot;
&quot; in more than 1,@@ 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ otherapy was studied ; in addition , the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos resulted in lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , allowing blood sugar levels to be reduced by 15 mg , 30 mg , and 45 mg doses . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of an additional dose of Ac@@ tos for existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin in a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values was 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional addition of placebo resulted in a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was examined in 28@@ 9 patients , the patients treated Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin , reduced H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values from 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients receiving placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events associated with Ac@@ tos were visual disturbances , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ aes@@ th@@ esia ( reduced sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or any of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one mirrors - acid levels in the blood ) . &quot;
it was decided that Ac@@ tos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients with met@@ form@@ in .
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission granted permission to the Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited to grant Ac@@ tos in@@ roads across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , arch@@ ed and carry on one side the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and is un@@ suitable for met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; no data is available for the use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under the age of 18 , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are at risk of having at least one risk factor ( e.g. previous heart attack or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) , the physician should start the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserves . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain , and ede@@ ma when pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin . &quot;
a cardiovascular outcome study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ ular disease was performed .
&quot; this study showed an increase in reports on heart failure , which however did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study . &quot;
in patients with increased output of liver enzymes ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one may not be used .
&quot; if the AL@@ T levels are increased to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzymes are to be checked again as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops symptoms that indicate a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enzymes are to be checked . &quot;
the decision as to whether the treatment of the patient with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one should be continued should be conducted by the clinical assessment until the results of the laboratory parameters .
&quot; in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one a dose @-@ dependent weight gain was detected , which can stir from fatty deposits and in some cases linked to fluid retention . &quot;
&quot; as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution , a minor reduction of the mean hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction of 4.1 % ) occurred under the treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one . &quot;
similar changes were observed in comparative studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients receiving pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one as oral two @-@ fold or triple @-@ combination therapy with insulin , the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the market was launched under treatment with thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ Indians , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , worsen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma was reported with a decrease in visual acuity . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but prescri@@ bing physicians should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma when patients report disorders of visual acuity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of adverse events related to frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years for women who were treated with a comparative medication .
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of more than 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or occurs this treatment is dep@@ rec@@ ated ( see section 4.6 ) . &quot;
&quot; studies on the interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has no relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; interactions with medicines that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not expected . &quot;
the simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a decrease in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one the hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal dimin@@ ishes and thereby reduces the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth .
&quot; very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; common &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , single cases : unknown ( not inv@@ alu@@ able in present data ) . &quot;
&quot; these lead to a temporary change in the tur@@ g@@ or and refrac@@ tive index of the lens , as seen in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic substances . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , AL@@ T @-@ An@@ sti@@ ege were often seen as often as placebo , but less frequently than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl resin . &quot;
&quot; in an Out@@ come study in patients with pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ ular disease , the incidence of severe heart failure among pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than placebo , if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one respectively . &quot;
&quot; since the market launch it has rarely been reported on cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency among Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , but more often if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; a summary analysis of adverse events concerning frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials was conducted over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and over 7,@@ 400 patients treated with comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; over a period of 3.5 years of Pro@@ Active study , frac@@ tures appeared in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms occurred . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on seems to have an activation of specific nuclear recept@@ ors ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) , leading to increased insulin sensitivity in liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells . &quot;
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose level in the event of insulin resistance .
a clinical trial involving Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ zid as a mon@@ otherapy was continued over two years to investigate the time until the therapeutic effect is delayed ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.@@ 0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
&quot; at the time of two years after the start of therapy , blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.@@ 0 % ) was maintained by pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ zid ) . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was insufficient despite three months of optimization with insulin , were random@@ ised to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c decreased by 0.@@ 45 % compared to patients receiving only insulin ; a reduction in insulin dosage in the treated group was observed . &quot;
in clinical trials over a year under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ent compared to the initial values .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small study of type 2 diabetes .
&quot; in most clinical studies , compared to placebo , total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol as well as slightly , however clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL cholesterol levels were observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduced total plasma gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zid and increased HD@@ L cholesterol . &quot;
&quot; compared to placebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol was observed among Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on while lower levels were observed in met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ zid . &quot;
&quot; in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduced not only the n@@ ett@@ le tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved the post pran@@ dial elevated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , this both through an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ ular disease were random@@ ized in groups that received either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; after oral application , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is resor@@ bed quickly , with top concentrations of imm@@ utable pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in the plasma usually 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV is equivalent to the three @-@ fold effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; interaction studies demonstrated that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
the simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) and lowers the plasma concentration of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; after oral use of radio@@ actively marked pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in rot@@ ting ( 55 % ) and a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) . &quot;
the mean plasma @-@ elimination period of imm@@ utable pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one amounts to 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans and the total active metabol@@ ites are 16 - 23 hours .
&quot; the plasma concentrations of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of oral Clear@@ ance are similar . &quot;
&quot; in toxic@@ ological studies mice , rats , dogs and monkeys conver@@ ged after repeated administration of plasma volume increase with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ emia and reversible ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy . &quot;
this is due to the fact that under treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one the hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal dimin@@ ishes and thereby reduces the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) the rat increased incidence of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( male and female rats ) and tumours ( male rats ) of the ur@@ inary bladder .
in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) the treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ Indians lead to increased frequency of col@@ on tum@@ ors .
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years for women who were treated with a comparative medication .
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of more than 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; in another study over two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in were examined with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zid . &quot;
in clinical trials over 1 year under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ent compared to the initial values .
&quot; in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduced not only the n@@ ett@@ le tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved the post @-@ pran@@ dial elevated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , this both through an effect on the Tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and the h@@ ep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ g@@ liz@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;

&quot; Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane was examined in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to use the insulin effectively . &quot;
&quot; in the study , after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane resulted in a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , indicating that blood sugar levels were lowered similarly to another human insulin . &quot;
Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
&quot; in addition , the doses of ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( the complete list is to be found in the package leaf@@ let ) . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the treatment of diabetes were out@@ weighed against the risks .
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the placing of ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
pre@@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice a day when a rapid initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
&quot; patients whose blood sugar level has improved significantly , for example , by intensified insulin therapy , can detect hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly . &quot;
&quot; any change regarding thickness , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast @-@ acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long @-@ acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( through re@@ combin@@ ant DNA towards insulin @-@ based insulin ) may cause a change in the dosage . &quot;
&quot; if a dose adjustment is required when switching to ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary at first dose or in the first weeks or months after the change@@ over . &quot;
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions following a change of animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .
&quot; before travelling , which goes through several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor as such trips may cause insulin and meals to be applied or taken at other times . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the doctor has to consider possible interactions in the therapy and always ask his patients for other medicines taken from them . &quot;
&quot; 4 Un@@ less hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia as well as hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , which can occur in a non @-@ controlled di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fru@@ ct@@ ose in uter@@ o . &quot;
severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias can lead to un@@ consciousness and / or sei@@ zur@@ es and end with temporary or permanent disorders of the brain function and even death .
disorders of the nervous system Occ@@ a@@ sional - Peri@@ ph@@ ere neu@@ rop@@ athy A rapid improvement in blood sugar control can be associated with complaints that are referred to as acute painful neu@@ rop@@ athy and are usually reversible .
5 A intensi@@ fication of insulin therapy with an ab@@ rupt improvement in the blood sugar level can be associated with a temporary worsen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic retin@@ opathy .
diseases of the skin and sub@@ cut@@ aneous tissue Ac@@ tu@@ ally - Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy At the injection site a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy can arise when failed to change the inser@@ tion points within the injection area .
&quot; local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ em@@ at@@ oma occur at the injection site ) during insulin therapy . &quot;
&quot; immune system diseases - Ur@@ tic@@ aria , Ex@@ an@@ them Very rare - an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reactions symptoms of gener@@ alized hyper@@ sensitivity , including gener@@ alized rash , it@@ ching , swe@@ ating , gastro@@ intestinal disorders , angi@@ on@@ eur@@ ot@@ ic ede@@ ma , heart pal@@ pit@@ ations , low blood pressure and impotence / un@@ consciousness . &quot;
&quot; hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can , however , develop gradually : • Easy hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can be treated by oral feed of glucose or sug@@ ary foods . &quot;
&quot; diabe@@ tics should therefore always have grape juice , candy , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Heavy hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia with un@@ consciousness is treated with an in@@ tra @-@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a proven auxiliary person or given intraven@@ ously by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum effect is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total active duration amounts to 24 hours . &quot;
resor@@ ption The absorption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed resor@@ ption .
a number of frac@@ ture ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insulin molecule were considered ; none of the metabol@@ ites formed by the split is active .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data does not reveal any particular danger to humans . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended - after the Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane water bottle has been extracted from the refrigerator - the temperature of the insulin at room temperature ( not above 25 ° C ) , before it is res@@ us@@ pen@@ ded according to the instructions for use for the first use . &quot;
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions following a change of animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .
&quot; therefore , the doctor has to consider possible interactions in the therapy and always ask his patients for other medicines taken from them . &quot;

13 The intensi@@ fication of insulin therapy with an ab@@ rupt improvement in blood sugar level can be associated with a temporary worsen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic retin@@ opathy .

this means that approximately half an hour after you have applied it to sink your blood sugar and that the effect lasts about 24 hours .
&quot; ► When you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to this insulin product , Met@@ ac@@ res@@ ol or any of the other ingredients ( see section 7 for more information ) . &quot;
take care of the symptoms of allergy : if you feel the first signs of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( symptoms of sub@@ contracting ) .
&quot; if your doctor has caused a change from an insulin type or brand to another , you may need to adjust the dose by your doctor . &quot;
&quot; ► Check the label , whether it is the correct insulin type ► Def@@ ect the rubber membrane with a medical t@@ amp@@ on . &quot;
&quot; if this is not completely intact , if you get the pier@@ cing bottle , put the pier@@ cing bottle back to your pharmacy : if it has not been kept correctly or frozen ( see 6 How to preserve Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane ? ) ► If it is not evenly white and clou@@ dy after res@@ us@@ p@@ ation . &quot;
use the injection technique that your doctor or die@@ ti@@ cian has recommended ► Let the injection needle for at least 6 seconds under your skin to make sure the full dose was inj@@ ected .
&quot; warning signs of a sub@@ contracting can suddenly appear and can be : cold sweat , cold pale skin , headache , heart rate , nausea , severe hunger , transi@@ ent vision , drow@@ sin@@ ess , anxiety , confusion , concentration difficulties . &quot;
&quot; tell your relatives , friends and close colleagues , that they will bring you to the stable side situation in the event of un@@ consciousness and immediately notify a doctor . &quot;
&quot; ► If a hard su@@ cking is not treated , this can lead to ( temporary or permanent ) brain damage or even death ► If you have a sub@@ contracting with un@@ consciousness or in cases of frequent occurrence , consult your doctor . &quot;
you can recover the consciousness faster if you inj@@ ected the hormone glu@@ c@@ agon by a person familiar with its gift .
this can happen : • If you inj@@ ure too much insulin • if you eat too little or leave a meal • if you are more than usual physically .
&quot; increased ur@@ inary urge , thirst , loss of appetite , nausea or vom@@ iting , drow@@ sin@@ ess or fatigue , dry skin , dry mouth and fruity ( after acet@@ one ) sm@@ elling breath . &quot;
• You have forgotten an insulin injection • repeated inj@@ ections of less insulin than you need • an infection or fever • more food than usual • less physical exercise than usual .
&quot; if you often have an injection at the same place , the sub@@ cut@@ aneous fatty tissue can shrink or increase ( lip@@ oh@@ y@@ per@@ dri@@ phy ) at this point . &quot;
&quot; if you notice depres@@ sions or thick@@ ening of your skin at the injection site , tell your doctor or die@@ ti@@ cian about it , as these reactions can wor@@ sen or affect the absorption of your insulin if you inj@@ ected into such a place . &quot;
&quot; immediately search for a doctor if symptoms of allergy spread to other parts of the body , or if you suddenly feel uncomfortable and you feel di@@ zzy or you have the impression of becoming unconscious . &quot;
you may have a very rare severe allergic reaction to ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane or any of its components ( a so @-@ called systemic allergic reaction ) .
&quot; if any of the side effects listed are significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not stated in this manual information , please inform your doctor , your diabetes consultant or your pharmac@@ ist . &quot;

&quot; in addition , the doses of acet@@ p@@ id may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar . &quot;
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the placing of ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; when two types of insulin are mixed , first the amount of insulin @-@ acting insulin must first be raised , then the amount of long acting insulin . &quot;

this can happen : • If you inj@@ ure too much insulin • if you eat too little or leave a meal • if you are more than usual physically .
always put the closing cap of your Nov@@ o@@ Let finished pens whenever it is not in use to protect it from light .
take the closing cap off . • disinf@@ ect the rubber membrane with a medical t@@ amp@@ on • Use the injection needle straight and firmly on Ac@@ tro@@ p@@ id Nov@@ o@@ Let ( Fig@@ ure A ) • P@@ ull the large outer cap of the injection needle and the internal cap of the injection needle .
proceed as follows to avoid the injection of air and ensure correct dosage : • Ke@@ ep Ac@@ tu@@ p@@ id Nov@@ o@@ Let with the injection needle upwards • Take a few times with your finger against the cartridge .
&quot; while air bubbles are present , they will collect the cartridge at the top of the cartridge • While the injection needle continues upward , press the cartridge around one click in the direction of the arrow ( figure C ) • Now , a drop of insulin must be removed from the tip of the injection needle . &quot;
• Place the cap on the finished pen again so that the digit 0 is opposite the metering mark ( Fig@@ ure D ) • Check if the button is pressed completely .
&quot; the scale on the closing cap shows 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 and 18 units . &quot;
&quot; the push button moves to the outside while you rotate the closing cap • The scale below the push button ( push button dial ) shows 20 , 40 and 60 units . &quot;
&quot; 107 • Record the highest number you can see on the press scale • add the two numbers to get the set dose • If you have set a wrong dose , turn the cap backwards or backwards , until you have set the correct number of units . &quot;
rotate it until the push button is down and you feel a resistance Take off the closing cap and set it up again so that the 0 of the metering mark is opposite .
make sure to press the press button only during the injection • Ke@@ ep the press button firmly after the injection until the injection needle is pulled out of the skin .
&quot; you may not use a dose that is higher than the number of units remaining in the cartridge • You can use the residual quantity scale to estimate how much insulin is left , but you can not use it to adjust or select your dose . &quot;

&quot; aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who have signs of crystal deposits , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in joints ) or rheum@@ atic no@@ des ( &quot; &quot; stones &quot; &quot; that can lead to joint and bone damage ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ur@@ ic acid level is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two or four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day . &quot;
&quot; during the first months of treatment , rheum@@ atism may still occur ; this is why it is recommended that patients take further medicines at least during the first six months of treatment with aden@@ ur@@ ic . &quot;
the drug is not recommended for children and for patients who had an organ transplan@@ t because it was not examined for these groups .
&quot; in the first study , involving 1,@@ 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the placebo ( placebo ) and allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , two doses of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each year with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was administered in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood were below 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
&quot; in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients , taking Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 from 26@@ 9 ) of patients receiving 120 mg once a day , in the last three measurements a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , this was 22 % ( 60 out of 26@@ 8 ) of patients suffering from allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in none of the 134 patients with placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver function . &quot;
&quot; especially in patients with heart problems in pre@@ history , there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid level in the blood than allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects related to the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia in diseases that have already lead to ur@@ ate deposits ( including one from the history of medical history known or currently present and / or arthritis ) .
&quot; if the serum acid level is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 35@@ 7 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase can be considered at AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe kidney function restriction , efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; since there are no experiences in children and adolescents , the use of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; since there is no experience in organ transplan@@ ts , the use of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compensated heart failure , the treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; as with other har@@ n@@ essing medication , it may occur during the course of the treatment , because of the lowering of the serum acid level in order to mobili@@ ze ur@@ ic acid deposits in the tissue . &quot;
&quot; B. with malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ on syndrome , the absolute concentration of x@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases is so far that it comes to a deposit in the ur@@ inary tract . &quot;
&quot; during phase 3 clinical trials , slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of liver function values were observed in patients treated with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is recommended to perform a liver function before the start of the F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ ding treatment and follow up a liver function test ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in Z@@ ist did not have any interaction studies on F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at but it is known that the X@@ O escap@@ ement can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line level ( a hibition of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ ll was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
&quot; in subjects , the simultaneous administration of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and n@@ apro@@ xen 250 mg 2 times was associated with an increase in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ s exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , the use of n@@ apro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with a clin@@ ically significant increase of adverse events . &quot;
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ amp@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without a dose adjustment for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or any other active ingredient required at the same time .
&quot; in a study with subjects , 120 mg of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 1 x had an average 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , indicating a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo . &quot;
&quot; An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an ant@@ acids containing magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminium hydro@@ xi@@ de , the absorption of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( around 1 hour ) delayed and a decrease in the C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but no significant change in AU@@ C . &quot;
pregnancy data about a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies do not include side effects of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of fet@@ us / new@@ bor@@ ns .
&quot; animal experiments do not allow direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic , fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle , operating machines or exercising dangerous activities until they can reasonably be certain that AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C does not adver@@ sely affect their performance . &quot;
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported in the overall study group compared to the allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol group was observed in the Pi@@ vot@@ al study phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al connection with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be detected .
the risk factors identified in these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ cl@@ erotic condition and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated heart failure in the medical history .
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) side effects which could occur in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and were reported in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups more than once , are listed below . &quot;
&quot; diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated concur@@ r@@ ently with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical trials no severe skin failures or serious hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed . &quot;
&quot; 7 Open long @-@ term extension studies In open long @-@ term extension studies 9@@ 06 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 3 years , 57 patients up to 4 years with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
the events related to long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
&quot; the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ s treatment groups more than once , and occurred in patients who received F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) . &quot;
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported in the pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 for these doses or at a lower frequency :
&quot; diabetes , hyper@@ lip@@ ide@@ mia , in@@ som@@ nia , hyp@@ ot@@ th@@ esia , noticeable E@@ KG , c@@ ough , short@@ ness of skin , skin lesi@@ ons , Bur@@ si@@ tis , protein ur@@ ie , ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , decrease in lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , decrease in the number of white blood cells . &quot;
&quot; effective mechanism ur@@ ic acid is the final product of pur@@ in@@ metabol@@ ism in humans , and is produced as part of the reaction sk@@ as@@ k@@ ade Hy@@ po@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ ic acid . &quot;
&quot; F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is a potent , non @-@ pur@@ ine selective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i value for the in vitro @-@ inhibit@@ or below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar range . &quot;
clinical trial results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) which were conducted with 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ik@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients with the last three month @-@ specific serum acid levels &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 35@@ 7 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 7 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 25@@ 8 ) for patients with a serum incre@@ ment value at the start of studies of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl . &quot;
the AP@@ EX study showed statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily and with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventional doses of allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x a day as well as with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the conven@@ tionally used dose of allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
&quot; patients with serum incre@@ ment values &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 50@@ 9 ) were summari@@ zed for analysis . * p &lt; 0,@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0,@@ 001 versus 80 mg &quot;
the reduction in serum acid levels to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 35@@ 7 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the visit of the doctor in week 2 and maintained permanently throughout the treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum incre@@ ment values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function restriction The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with kidney function restriction ( D. h .
&quot; with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients . &quot;
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage decrease of serum acid concentration in subjects regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney dysfunction ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
&quot; the data collected in two years of the open extension study phase 3 showed that in the months 16 @-@ 24 , less than 3 % of patients needed treatment against rheum@@ atism ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients did not need treatment against g@@ ushing ) . &quot;
&quot; this was associated with a reduction in the number of gi@@ ants , which resulted in 54 % of patients a complete disappearance of the no@@ des up to 24 months . &quot;
TS@@ H@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients receiving long @-@ term treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.@@ 8 % ) and also in patients who received allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in open long @-@ term extension studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the surface under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) from F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased propor@@ tionally after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose @-@ proportional . &quot;
doses of 120 mg and 300 mg are observed for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at an increase in AU@@ C which is greater than the dose @-@ proportional increase .
after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily the C@@ MA@@ x amounts to 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml .
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage decline of serum acid concentration if this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The apparent steady state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is between 29 and 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at plasma protein binding is approximately 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary bond to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
&quot; in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ s showed that these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are mainly formed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ s glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id is mainly caused by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; after taking an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose was found in the urine as un@@ changeable F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 30 % ) , its known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion of the urine , approximately 45 % of the dose was found in the stool as un@@ changeable F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; after taking multiple doses of 80 mg of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild , moderate or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the C@@ MA@@ x of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at did not change in proportion to subjects with normal kidney function . &quot;
&quot; the mean total AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased by about 1.8 times from 7.@@ 6.2 m g / ml in the group with normal ren@@ al function to 13,@@ 2 μ y / ml in the group with severe kidney function . &quot;
12 liver function restriction After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d@@ Pu@@ gh classification B ) Li@@ ver dysfunction changed the C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and its metabol@@ ites significantly compared to subjects with normal liver function .
age There were no significant changes in terms of the AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or its metabol@@ ites after taking multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in older patients compared to younger patients .
&quot; carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , impairment of fertility With male rats was found a statisti@@ cally significant increase in ur@@ inary bladder tumours ( transition cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and carcin@@ omas ) only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly @-@ treated group , in about 11 @-@ times of exposure to humans . &quot;
these findings are seen as a result of specific pur@@ ine metabolism and urine composition and is considered not relevant for clinical use .
it was found that F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day .
&quot; in high doses , which were about 4 @-@ fold of the human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred , which was accompanied by a decrease in breeding performance and a develop@@ mental delay in the descendants of rats . &quot;
&quot; ter@@ at@@ ological studies in carrying rats with ex@@ positions , about the 4.@@ 3 times and for bearing rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions , which amounted to about 13 times the human therapeutic exposure , did not produce ter@@ ato@@ genic effects . &quot;

&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease in which bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause , in which there is a risk of low vitamin D levels . &quot;
&quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da , calcium and vitamin supplements ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid irritation of the es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient must not lie down until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; since al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D@@ 3 are already used separately from each other in medicines approved in the European Union , the company presented data from previous studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to demonstrate the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of increasing vitamin D levels .
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) than those who only received al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the company also presented data suggest@@ ing that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate dose included in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE corresponds exactly to the dose , required for preventing bone loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , diar@@ rhe@@ a ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , sor@@ es ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) , vom@@ iting ( blo@@ ated stomach ) , infl@@ ated abdom@@ en ( blo@@ ated stomach ) as well as aci@@ dic shock . &quot;
&quot; in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other components AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be applied . &quot;
it must not be used for o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us diseases in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes .
&quot; in January 2007 , the European Commission granted the merger of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE within the European Union to the Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd . &quot;
&quot; capsule @-@ shaped , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; &quot; 7@@ 10 &quot; &quot; on the other side . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day . &quot;
the following guidelines are to be followed exactly to reduce the risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation and associated side effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
• Pati@@ ents should not ch@@ ew the tablet or melt the tablet in the mouth because there is a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • Pati@@ ents should not lie before the first food intake of the day that should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
&quot; B. pe@@ p@@ tic ul@@ cus , active gastro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract except p@@ yl@@ or@@ oplas@@ tic , can be given only with special caution ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions such as est@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and bru@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al strips , were reported in patients under the intake of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( partially these were severe and required hosp@@ ital@@ isation ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor should therefore be aware of any signs and symptoms that indicate possible malign@@ ant irritation , and the patients should be pointed out , when symptoms of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation like dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ sp@@ her@@ ical pain or new or worsen@@ ing heart@@ burn the medicine seek to obtain medical advice ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
3 The risk of severe es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects appears to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or take it following the occurrence of symptoms that indicate an es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation .
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; while in large @-@ scale clinical studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate no increased risk was detected , ga@@ stri@@ c and du@@ oden@@ al@@ ul@@ cer@@ a were rarely reported ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw , commonly associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regi@@ mens predominantly administered intraven@@ ously bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates . &quot;
there are no data available which indicate whether bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate treatment in patients who need a deeper surgical procedure reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw .
the clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for the therapy planning for each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed to take the tablet in the next morning when taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after they have noticed their failure .
&quot; you should not take two tablets the same day , but take the intake of one tablet per week as originally planned on the intended week day . &quot;
other diseases affecting the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be adequately treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE before starting treatment .
&quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate food and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the absorption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate when taken at the same time . &quot;
&quot; therefore , after taking al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific interaction studies were not performed , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken in clinical trials with a variety of commonly prescribed drugs without clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only intended for application in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or breast@@ feeding women .
&quot; animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate leave no indication of directly harmful effects in terms of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development . &quot;
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports come from cancer patients but also reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis patients .
&quot; nevertheless , decreases in serum levels of &lt; 0 m@@ mo@@ l / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and serum phosph@@ ats up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0,@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred in both treatment groups with similar frequency . &quot;
&quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at In@@ struc@@ tions of an oral over@@ dose may include hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia , and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , o@@ sop@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a . &quot;

&quot; the main effect of 1.@@ 25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ pro D@@ 3 is the increase in intestinal absorption of calcium and phosph@@ ate , as well as the regulation of serum calcium , ren@@ al ex@@ cre@@ tion of calcium and phosph@@ ate , bone formation and bone resor@@ ption . &quot;
&quot; in severe cases , a lack of secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia , weakness of proxim@@ al mus@@ cul@@ ature and oste@@ om@@ al@@ ac@@ ia can lead to a further increased risk of falls and frac@@ tures in oste@@ opor@@ otic persons . &quot;

the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture incidence for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were studied in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) and frac@@ ture intervention trial ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 45@@ 9 ) .
&quot; in the phase III studies , the mean asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 10 mg / day in relation to placebo after 3 years 8.@@ 8 % on the spine , 5.@@ 9 % at the fem@@ ur and 7.@@ 8 % at the tro@@ chan@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; in the group treated with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , a 48 % reduction ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 3.2 % versus placebo 6 2 % ) was achieved in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more spinal frac@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D were continued by the spine and the tro@@ chan@@ ter ; also the BM@@ D of the fem@@ oral neck and the whole body was maintained . &quot;
&quot; fit consisted of two placebo @-@ controlled studies , where Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 m@@ g. daily , either over 1 or 2 years ) : &quot;
in this study the daily dose of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the appearance of at least one new spinal frac@@ ture by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.@@ 9 % versus placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
resor@@ ption The average oral bi@@ over@@ flow of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women was 0.@@ 64 % for doses ranging from 5 to 70 mg after noc@@ tur@@ nal fasting and two hours before taking a standardized breakfast .
bio@@ availability decreased correspon@@ dingly to 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
&quot; in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day . &quot;
&quot; in healthy subjects , the gift of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times a day over five days ) did not lead to any clin@@ ically meaningful change in oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in average in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 distribution studies in rats showed that al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate temporarily spread in soft tissue after intraven@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , but then quickly spread into the bones or ex@@ cre@@ ted with the urine . &quot;
&quot; ex@@ cre@@ tion After IV administration of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , about 50 % of the radioactive substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with the urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the decay . &quot;
&quot; following IV administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clearing of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 71 ml / min and systemic clearing was not exceeded 200 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; in rats , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted via the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys and therefore it is not assumed that in humans the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other drugs is influenced by these transport systems . &quot;

&quot; ex@@ cre@@ tion In the gift of radio@@ actively marked vitamin D@@ 3 to healthy subjects , the mean ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in the urine was 2.4 % in the urine , after 4 days 4.@@ 9 % . &quot;
&quot; characteristics in patients &apos; prec@@ lin@@ ical studies have shown that the proportion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not deposited in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted via the urine . &quot;
&quot; although no clinical data is available , however , the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal experiments is also reduced in patients with reduced kidney function . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with reduced kidney function , a slightly increased level of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate can be expected in the bone ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;

&quot; Ad@@ agra@@ f is administered to adult patients , which have been transplan@@ ted to kidney or liver in order to prevent rejection of transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system . &quot;
&quot; as Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previous studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft and data from published literature . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results of a clinical study were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ t , whereby the application was compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in whom the transplan@@ t was rejected after a treatment duration of one year ( by examining , for example , how often a re @-@ transplan@@ t or re @-@ recording of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , shorter further studies were carried out on 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ t and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ t and examined how Adv@@ agra@@ f is absorbed by the body in comparison to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft . &quot;
&quot; tre@@ mor , headache , nausea , vom@@ iting , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , kidney problems , increased blood sugar levels ( hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ) , hypertension , hypertension ( hypertension ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( In@@ som@@ nia ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other ingredients must not be applied . &quot;
&quot; patients and doctors must be cau@@ tious when others ( especially some herbal ) medicines are taken at the same time with adv@@ agra@@ ph , as the Ad@@ agra@@ f dose or the dose of the medication taken at the same time must be adjusted accordingly . &quot;
&quot; hard capsules , ret@@ ar@@ ded yellow @-@ orange gel@@ atine capsules , printed in red ink on the light yellow capsule upper part with &quot; 0.5 mg &quot; and on the orange capsule bottom with &quot; &quot; 6@@ 47 &quot; &quot; ; they contain white powder . &quot;
only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or over@@ immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; Modification of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under the tight control of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; as a result of a change to an alternative formulation , therapeutic drug surveillance and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact . &quot;
the dosage of Adv@@ agra@@ f should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood level provisions ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations )
&quot; after moving Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ ph , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels should be controlled before conversion and over two weeks after conversion . &quot;
&quot; on Day 4 , systemic exposure was comparable with both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients . &quot;
careful and repeated checks of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ tal@@ low levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t under Adv@@ agra@@ ph to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate night ran@@ splan@@ tation phase .
&quot; as Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a low @-@ Clear@@ ance substance , an adjustment of the chart can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached . &quot;
&quot; if the condition of the patient in the first postoperative period permits no oral ing@@ es@@ tion of medicines , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment can be administered intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml of concentrate to produce an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca . &quot;
&quot; duration of use For suppression of gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , the maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified . &quot;
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should start with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
&quot; further dose adjustment may be necessary later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of the patient &apos;s stabili@@ zation after transplantation . &quot;
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should start with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
&quot; dosage recommendation - switch from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f M@@ ust a transplan@@ ted recipient of twice daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to a once daily dose of Adv@@ agra@@ ph must be revers@@ ed , so this change has to take place in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the entire daily dose . &quot;
kidney and liver transplan@@ t After a transition from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to adv@@ agra@@ f once a day the treatment with the recommended oral initial dose should commen@@ ce for the pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection .
an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is to be taken every day in the morning for adult patients who are converted to Adv@@ agra@@ ph .
&quot; other transplan@@ t recipients , although there is no clinical experience with adv@@ agra@@ f in lung , pancre@@ atic , and color@@ ectal patients , occurred in a oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / day , with pancre@@ atic transplan@@ ted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day . &quot;
dose adjustment in specific patient populations patients with reduced liver function to maintain blood levels in the targeted area can be necessary in patients with severe liver function disorders a reduction of the dose .
&quot; patients with reduced kidney function As the kidney function does not influence the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not necessary . &quot;
&quot; however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , a careful monitoring of the kidney function ( including a regular determination of the serum cholesterol level , a calculation of the cre@@ atine content and a monitoring of urine volume ) is recommended . &quot;
&quot; conversion from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to adv@@ agra@@ f When switching from a c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus based therapy , caution is required ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases with the aid of thorou@@ gh@@ bred Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ si controls .
&quot; it is recommended to perform frequent checks of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels during the first two weeks after transplantation , followed by periodi@@ c checks during maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels should also be controlled after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ ph , Dos@@ age adjustments , changes of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or at the same time applying substances that could change the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus full blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; as Adv@@ agra@@ ph is a medicine with a low clearing , adjustments to the dose may require several days until the Ste@@ ady State has entered . &quot;
clinical studies indicate that successful treatment in most cases is possible if the levels in the blood are not exceeding 20 ng / ml .
&quot; in clinical practice , Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dor@@ man@@ t levels are commonly found in the first time following liver transplan@@ ts in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and in patients with heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml . &quot;
&quot; during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ ts , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were generally used . &quot;
&quot; this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects resulting from Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus underground or over@@ exposure . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; Modification of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under the tight control of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; 5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved immune to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there is no clinical data for the ret@@ ardi@@ zed formulation Adv@@ agra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ ts and transplan@@ t recipients , there is no clinical data for the ret@@ ardi@@ zed formulation Adv@@ agra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; because of possible interactions , which may lead to a reduction of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) is to be avoided during treatment with adv@@ agra@@ f ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is required , as the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels may be subject to substantial fluctuations . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , pro@@ gra@@ f was observed as a cardi@@ omy@@ opathy called corneal or sep@@ tum @-@ hyper@@ tro@@ phy , which can therefore also occur under Adv@@ agra@@ ph . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , fluid over@@ load and ede@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be limited by appropriate clothing or use of a sun protection device with a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients who take Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus are symptoms of PRE@@ S such as headache , altered state of consciousness , sp@@ as@@ ms and visual disturbances , a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g . &quot;
&quot; as Adv@@ agra@@ f Hart@@ capsules , ret@@ ardi@@ zed , lac@@ tose contain , special caution is required in patients with the rare heredi@@ tary lac@@ tose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption . &quot;
simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can influence the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and thus increase or lower the blood levels of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
it is therefore recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels while simultaneously offering substances that can alter the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose to maintain equal concentrations ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
&quot; a strongly distinctive interaction has been associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ lid antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies revealed that the increase in blood levels mainly resulted from increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus caused by the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal metabolism .
&quot; highly d@@ osed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood . &quot;
the effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other drugs Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors ; therefore the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus with medicines which are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can interfere with their metabolism .
&quot; as Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the clearing of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase hormone exposition , decisions about contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures can be particularly cau@@ tious . &quot;
the results of animal studies have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can potentially reduce the clear@@ ances of pent@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital and phen@@ az@@ one and extend their half @-@ life time .
the results of a small number of transplan@@ t patients have no indication that under Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
&quot; in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for possible harmful effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially regarding its effect on the kidneys ) . &quot;
&quot; there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ cal@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. : &quot;
the side effect of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant drugs is often not exactly determined because of the underlying disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
&quot; the side effects are listed following their frequency in descending order : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( exceeding the basis of available data ) . &quot;

cases of BK @-@ Virus @-@ associated ne@@ ph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients under immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression therapy including therapy with adv@@ agra@@ f .
it was reported about ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tumours in connection with the treatment with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
&quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and the high binding of ery@@ thro@@ cytes and plasma proteins , Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus cannot be di@@ aly@@ m@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; action mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects on a molecular level are likely to convey the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus through its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ole protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the cellular nucleus . &quot;
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent in@@ hibition of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell and thus prevents the tran@@ scription of a specific series of lymph@@ oma genes .
&quot; Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus op@@ presses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of B cells dependent on T @-@ hel@@ per cells , and the formation of lymph@@ oma ( like inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) and the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor . &quot;
&quot; 12 confirmed acute rep@@ ul@@ sion was 3@@ 2.6 % within the first 24 weeks ( N = 2@@ 37 ) 3@@ 2.6 % , and in the Pro@@ gra@@ f group ( N = 2@@ 34 ) 29.@@ 3 % . &quot;

&quot; patients survival rates after 12 months were 9@@ 6.@@ 9 % for advance and 9@@ 7.5 % for Pro@@ gra@@ f ; in the Adv@@ agra@@ ph arm 10 ( 3 women , 7 men ) and pro@@ gra@@ f arm 8 ( 3 women , 5 men ) were killed . &quot;
&quot; efficacy and safety of Pro@@ gra@@ f , C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in and Adv@@ agra@@ ph were compared in combination with Basili@@ xi@@ mab antibody reduction , MM@@ F and cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , in 6@@ 38 de nov@@ o kidney transplan@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; incidence of therapy failure after 12 months ( defined as death , gra@@ ft loss , biop@@ sy @-@ confirmed acute rejection or missing follow @-@ up data ) was 14.@@ 0 % in the Pro@@ gra@@ f group ( N = 2@@ 12 ) and 17.@@ 0 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( N = 2@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; the treatment difference was -@@ 3.0 % ( Adv@@ agra@@ f@@ - C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ) ( 9@@ 5.2 % confidence interval &#91; -@@ 9.@@ 9 % , 4.0 % &#93; ) for Pro@@ gra@@ f vs C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the Adv@@ agra@@ ph arm 3 ( men ) , in the Pro@@ gra@@ f arm 10 ( 3 women , 7 men ) and in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in arm 6 ( 3 women , 3 men ) . &quot;
&quot; published results of primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the form of Pro@@ gra@@ f used twice a day after other primary organ transplan@@ ts Pro@@ gra@@ f has developed into a recognised primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant following pancre@@ atic , lung and intestinal transplan@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; 175 particle transplan@@ ted patients , in 4@@ 75 patients undergoing pancre@@ atic transplantation , were used as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant in 6@@ 30 cases . &quot;
&quot; overall , the safety profile of oral pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies was consistent with observations in the large studies in which Pro@@ gra@@ f was used for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients . &quot;
&quot; lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted , multi@@ center study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f , more than 110 patients were reported to receive either Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in as part of a 1 : 1 random@@ ization . &quot;
&quot; chronic gra@@ ft rejection , bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis ob@@ liter@@ ans@@ - syndrome , was less common in the first year after transplantation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) . &quot;
&quot; survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus were reported in 21.@@ 7 % of cases of bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis , compared to 3@@ 8.@@ 0 % under C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 13 ) was significantly greater ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients converted from Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases in which there was no acute gra@@ ft rejection was greater after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the treatment transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) . &quot;
&quot; in one study , the incidence of bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis was significantly lower in patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus . &quot;
a multi@@ center study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f was performed to 205 patients who simultaneously underwent pancre@@ atic and kidney transplantation following a random@@ ised procedure called Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initial dose ( per protocol ) of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached after reaching the desired level of the valley from 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5 .
&quot; the published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after color@@ ectal transplan@@ ts showed an up @-@ to @-@ date survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years . &quot;

factors such as low ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ m@@ ite and low protein concentrations lead to an increase in the un@@ bound fraction of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or a strengthening of metabolism due to treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids should be responsible for the higher clearance rates observed after transplantation .
&quot; this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby ex@@ cre@@ tion is mainly done via bile . &quot;
&quot; in stable patients treated by Pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice daily ) in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) relative to the total daily dose , systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was approximately 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f . &quot;

advoc@@ ates are used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( a con@@ genital blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorder caused by the lack of factor VI@@ II ) .
dosage and frequency of application are based on whether adv@@ ates are used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding during surgical procedures .
&quot; patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , causing blood cl@@ ots like bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs . &quot;
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but produced according to a method called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology . &quot;
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced to the formation of the human co@@ agulation factor VI@@ II .
&quot; adv@@ ate is similar to another drug approved in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is produced in a different way so that the drug does not contain proteins of human or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies on patients with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study of 53 children under six years , the use of the drug was examined for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , adv@@ ate efficacy in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood c@@ anti@@ sep@@ tic iso@@ des was &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; good &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , headache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies to Factor VI@@ II . &quot;
&quot; lawyers may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against human co@@ agulation factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission granted Ba@@ x@@ ter AG a permit for the placing of lawyers throughout the European Union . &quot;
dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of the factor VI@@ II deficiency and the location and extent of bleeding and the patient &apos;s clinical condition .
&quot; during the following hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events , the factor VI@@ II activity should not sink below the specified plasma levels ( in % of the standard or I.@@ E. / dl ) . &quot;
&quot; injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours for patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer , until the pain and acute depression are eliminated . &quot;
repeat every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours for patients under 6 years ) until the patient &apos;s risk is over .
&quot; during the treatment course , appropriate determination of the Factor VI@@ II plasma levels is recommended to control the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; individual patients may differ in their reaction to factor VI@@ II , varying in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ life times . &quot;
3 Pro@@ phyla@@ xis For long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VI@@ II per kg body weight should be given by a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected factor VI@@ II plasma activity is not achieved or if bleeding is not controlled with an adequate dose , a test must be carried out to detect an inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be considered . &quot;
&quot; the administration speed should depend on the patient &apos;s condition , and a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VI@@ II is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in treating patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
&quot; these inhibit@@ ors are always directed against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of Factor VI@@ II directed Ig@@ G immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Beth@@ es@@ da as@@ say . &quot;
&quot; the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to the Factor VI@@ II , whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is most important and depends on genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 re@@ positioning days and an@@ am@@ n@@ esia of well @-@ known inhibit@@ ors , after conversion from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VI@@ II product to another , the recur@@ rence of ( low @-@ tri@@ gen ) inhibit@@ ors was observed . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ ophi@@ lia A in women , there are no experiences about the use of factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; the most common A@@ DR@@ s were inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , which showed a higher risk for the formation of inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) . &quot;
&quot; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely known ( frequency based on available data ) . &quot;
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated on the basis of the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected decrease of the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VI@@ II levels occurred postoperative ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in@@ fusion .
blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the time and both the Factor VI@@ II@@ - Mir@@ ror as well as the Clear@@ ance rate showed sufficient values once again on the 15 postoperative day .
&quot; in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed heavy to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) , only one patient showed a low inhibit@@ ory type ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed heavy to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) after previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or was detected . &quot;
&quot; in previously untreated patients of an ongoing clinical trial , 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E treated patients treated inhibit@@ ors against Factor VI@@ II . &quot;
&quot; the immune response of patients on traces of contaminated proteins was analyzed by examining the antibody ti@@ ters against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects . &quot;
&quot; one patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as an ongoing peak of the antibody &apos;s anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , but no signs or symptoms indicated on an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity . &quot;
&quot; four patients were reported separately on the appearance of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , skin rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ ophi@@ le gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cytes in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the scope of the study . &quot;
&quot; 7 As with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E reported hyper@@ sensitivity reactions from the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reactions ( frequency unknown ) . &quot;
the activated Factor VI@@ II acts as a co @-@ factor for the activated Factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X from factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E were performed in pre @-@ treated patients with severe or moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( basic value of the factor VI@@ II activity ≤ 2 % ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters come from a cross @-@ over study with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in 100 previously treated patients equal or &gt; 10 years and are listed in the table 3 below .

&quot; based on the data available since the initial approval , the CH@@ MP has further evaluated the benefit risk assessment , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons : &quot;
&quot; therefore , the CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E , which makes a filing of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , decided that the authorisation holder should apply for another extension process in 5 years . &quot;
&quot; in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited announced the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company re@@ jects its application for the transfer of lawyers to the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer . &quot;
&quot; however , the chest , the brain , the bones or the soft parts ( tissues that connect , surround and base other structures in the body ) are affected . &quot;
this is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; , &quot; which has been modified in such a way that there are no copies of themselves and thus can cause no infections in humans . &quot;
adv@@ ex@@ in could have been inj@@ ected directly into the tumours and thus enable the cancer cells to re@@ form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein , which is made of the p@@ 53 gene present in the human body , is normally used to restore cor@@ rupted DNA and kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered . &quot;
&quot; in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide . &quot;
&quot; the company presented data from a study with a patient involving Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the area of the under@@ belly , in the bones and in the brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP looked at the company &apos;s answers to the questions asked , there were still some questions un@@ solved . &quot;
&quot; based on the review of the submitted documents , the CH@@ MP creates a list of questions sent to the company on day 120 . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of lawyers in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ore could benefit patients . &quot;
&quot; the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in a reliable way and that it is neither harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
the company did not know whether the withdrawal consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; Com@@ bin@@ ed Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; changed drug release &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are put together in such a way that one of the effective components is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours . &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever caused by an allergy to pol@@ len ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
&quot; for adults and adolescents aged 12 and over , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice a day to be taken with a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cl@@ utter@@ ed . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be traced back to the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main efficacy measurements were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; when examining all hay fever symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , patients reported that aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze decreased by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients who took pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone . &quot;
&quot; when only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was seen , patients with a@@ a@@ a@@ ze showed a reduction of the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients who had lost the loss of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of a@@ ero ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , mouth dry , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ otor hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ency ( som@@ n@@ ol@@ ency ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another medicine for the treatment of allergies ) . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze must not be applied in patients who suffer from a narrow angle glaucoma ( increased intra@@ ocular pressure ) , cardiac or vascular diseases , including hypertension ( hypertension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ re@@ osis ( cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge stroke ) or have a risk of a hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a permit for the transport of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but is swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without sh@@ ading , breaking or chew@@ ing ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of data on harm@@ lessness and efficacy ( see section 5.1 ) , Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used for children under 12 years of age . &quot;
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms decay .
&quot; it is recommended to limit the application period to 10 days , as in long @-@ term use the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine can decrease over time . &quot;
&quot; following a decline in the swelling of mu@@ c@@ ous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , treatment may be continued with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n as a mon@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; since Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or or within 2 weeks of termination of such therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity associated with combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ p@@ tin , per@@ gol@@ amin , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ g@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ ges@@ tiv@@ a , phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ oline , n@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) . &quot;
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient group and the data did not suff@@ ice to address appropriate dosage recommendations .
&quot; safety and efficacy of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze have not been tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction , and the data is not sufficient to provide appropriate dosage recommendations . &quot;
&quot; patients must be informed that treatment in case of hypertension or ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as , nausea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as headaches or strengthening headaches ) must be dis@@ continued . &quot;
&quot; treatment of the following patient groups is advised : • Pati@@ ents under digital@@ is • Pati@@ ents with cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia • Pati@@ ents with hypertension • Pati@@ ents with m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck construction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , as anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions or reduce them to their extent . &quot;
&quot; in the course of clinical trials involving Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered additionally , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed . &quot;
&quot; in the results of the psych@@ om@@ ot@@ oric test , no significant differences could be found between the patients treated with adi@@ at@@ adi@@ n and placebo , regardless of whether Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was taken alone or with alcohol . &quot;
&quot; the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out . &quot;
&quot; Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhibit@@ ing and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins . &quot;
&quot; the harm@@ lessness of the use of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies , however , did not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency in the normal population . &quot;
&quot; since reproductive studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; patients should , however , be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to a di@@ zz@@ iness which can lead to impairment of transport or the ability to operate machinery . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ ne@@ a , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ an@@ ose , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ tu@@ ce processes . &quot;
&quot; headache , anxiety , difficult mic@@ tion , muscular weakness , increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory failure , heart rhythm disorders , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thirst , tran@@ spir@@ ation , nausea , vom@@ iting , pre@@ cor@@ di@@ ale pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , visual disturbances and hyp@@ ot@@ ony . &quot;
&quot; CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( dry mouth , pup@@ illary stiff@@ ness and - di@@ lat@@ ation , redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include both inhibit@@ ing the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ st@@ cells / bas@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the hem@@ ophi@@ le molecule P @-@ Selec@@ tin on end@@ otheli@@ al cells . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of flight performance , including ampli@@ fication of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical studies , no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo was found at the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. a day . &quot;
&quot; the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine at the recommended dosage can produce other symp@@ a@@ thetic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestation of a CN@@ S arous@@ al . &quot;
&quot; there were 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving a@@ a@@ a@@ ze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic efficacy of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined by the total score for the symptoms ( except nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling ) , was significantly higher than in a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling , was significantly higher than in a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; in view of gender , age or eth@@ ni@@ city , the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets did not show any significant differences . &quot;
&quot; as part of a single dose study on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after administration . &quot;
&quot; after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy subjects over 14 days , the flow equilibrium of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 . &quot;
&quot; as part of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi@@ dose study carried out with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , it was found that four test persons des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n badly metabol@@ ised . &quot;
a component interaction study shows that exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine according to the sole administration of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine bio@@ equivalent was intended for exposure to an aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze tablet .
&quot; however , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not reveal any particular danger to humans based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity and reproduction toxic@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine . &quot;
&quot; in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies , the combination of lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n / pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbit in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day . &quot;

&quot; tell your doctor if you are experiencing or diagnos@@ ing the following symptoms or diseases with you under the use of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze : • high blood pressure • heart beat , heart pal@@ pit@@ ations • nausea and headaches , or strengthening of existing headache . &quot;
&quot; when taking Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription . &quot;
&quot; if used in the recommended dosage , it is not to be expected that aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze conduc@@ ts di@@ zz@@ iness or decreases attention . &quot;
if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should inform immediately your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should .
&quot; if you have forgotten the intake of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze if you forgot to take a dose in time , get the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the scheduled time . &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the mentioned side effects may neg@@ atively affect you or notice side effects that are not stated in this user information .

&quot; after the launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n very rarely has been reported on cases of severe allergic reactions ( breathing difficulties , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves and swelling ) or skin rash . &quot;
&quot; cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ asing , stomach pain , nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , diar@@ rhe@@ a , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , muscle pain , sei@@ zur@@ es , rest@@ lessness with increased bodily activity , over cases of liver inflammation and over cases of conspic@@ uous liver values has also been reported very rarely . &quot;
&quot; it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 mg ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ ate for inser@@ ting ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution for intake . &quot;
&quot; for children aged one to five , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , which in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup or sy@@ rup . &quot;
&quot; for children aged six to eleven , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or . &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us was studied in eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies to patients who also had asthma ) .
&quot; efficacy was measured by determining the change in symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the add@@ les , impairment of sleep and performance on the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies have been presented to prove that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution for intake and the melt tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless . &quot;
&quot; in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us increased by 25 to 32 % compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving a placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies at Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decrease in symptoms after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % compared to 40 and 33 % compared to patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a permit for the placing of A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; one tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the interven@@ ing allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the previous disease process and can be resum@@ ed after the symptoms have been canc@@ eled and resum@@ ed at their re@@ occurrence .
the persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during the allergy season .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the performance reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should , however , be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to di@@ zz@@ iness , which may lead to impairment of transport or the ability to operate machinery . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in the recommended dose of 5 mg daily in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; adverse events reported more often than placebo reported fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , mouth dry ( 0.8 % ) and headaches ( 0.@@ 6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study involving 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common adverse effect was headache , this occurred in 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multiple dose study that was administered up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) .
&quot; this includes both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ st@@ cells / bas@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the ul@@ sion@@ sm@@ ol@@ ecular P @-@ Selec@@ tin on end@@ otheli@@ al cells . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical study with multiple boxes , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval showed . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of flight performance , including ampli@@ fication of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nose secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seas@@ on@@ ally and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may also be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s depending on the duration of the symptoms . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the stress caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s as shown on the overall score of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis .
&quot; the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology , not@@ withstanding the eti@@ ology of the different forms , is similar and chronic patients can be recru@@ ited as pro@@ spec@@ tively . &quot;
&quot; since hist@@ am@@ ination is a caus@@ ative factor in all ur@@ tic@@ aria conditions , it is expected that in addition to chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , this will also lead to an improvement in the symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and reduction of size and number of padd@@ les at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka was excluded from the study . &quot;
improvement of the itch spread by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients who were treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and wak@@ efulness , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluating these variables . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which patients were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was achieved in 4 % of patients . &quot;
there are no clu@@ es for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation once daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days before .
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so interactions with other medicines are not completely eliminated . &quot;
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 in vi@@ vo and in vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhibit@@ ing and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
&quot; in a single dose study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , calorie @-@ rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies carried out with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not reveal any particular danger to humans . &quot;

&quot; A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of the meals , to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that there are no data available to support an infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ic anom@@ ali@@ es , an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis . &quot;
approximately 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabol@@ ise Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and experience a higher substance load ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years which are fully met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed is identical to that of children who metabol@@ ise normally .
&quot; this drug contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with heredi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ char@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency of this drug should not be taken . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol did not increase the performance of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the overall incidence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group as in the placebo group .
&quot; in clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than those treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi@@ dose study of adults and adolescents , up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) were administered , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
children aged between 1 and 11 who were eligible for anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy received a daily dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
&quot; because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical study involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was applied over ten days in adults , no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval showed . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical studies , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents was no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; at a single @-@ daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets performed in clinical trials with no impairment of psych@@ om@@ otor functions in adults and adolescents . &quot;
&quot; in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous intake of alcohol was neither to increase the alcohol @-@ induced power impairment nor increase the drow@@ sin@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nose secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; as shown on the overall score of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and reduction of size and number of padd@@ les at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; spread of this limited metabol@@ ising phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ sian ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi@@ dose study with the sy@@ rup formulation in children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s which are fully met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ time of about 120 hours .
there are no clu@@ es for clin@@ ically relevant active substance cum@@ ulation once daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In several single dose studies AU@@ C and C@@ MA@@ x values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients were comparable with those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup is offered in type III bre@@ ading bottles with child @-@ safe poly@@ propylene connection cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml . &quot;

take a dose of A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at once a day to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ ate can be taken to take in without damaging them . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were also applied ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets daily than in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multiple dose study , where up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) were applied , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at was well tolerated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with multiple boxes , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was applied over ten days , no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval showed . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical studies , no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo was found at the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. a day . &quot;
&quot; in a 17 single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurements of flight performance , including ampli@@ fication of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nose secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the stress caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s as shown on the overall score of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis .
&quot; 18 In a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which patients were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was achieved in 4 % of patients . &quot;

two A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg melt tablets once daily in the mouth to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there are limited clinical studies on efficacy in the application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
&quot; immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the melt tablet is removed without damaging them . &quot;
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of processed tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years has not been proven so far .
the overall frequency of adverse events between the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and the placebo group was equal and did not devi@@ ate significantly from the safety profile identified in adult patients .
&quot; at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us Mel@@ zer was used as a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ ate for det@@ oxi@@ fying Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical study with multiple boxes , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically significant &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurements of flight performance , including ampli@@ fication of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this poorly metabol@@ ising phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and among black ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) , the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population . &quot;
&quot; in single dose crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us melt tablet with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ ate , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not studied in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients , but in combination with the dosage studies in children , however , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melt tablets support the use of the 2.5 mg dosage in children aged 6 to 11 . &quot;

&quot; at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of processed tablets proved to be the bio@@ equivalent of the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ ate for det@@ oxi@@ fying Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with multiple boxes , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;

&quot; in single dose crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of processed tablets with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ ate , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent . &quot;
overall analysis of pre @-@ clinical and clinical trials for the melt tablet revealed that this formulation is an impro@@ b@@ able risk for local irrit@@ ations in clinical use .
&quot; the safety of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in children between 2 and 11 years , which is fully met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed , is identical to that in children who metabol@@ ise normally . &quot;
&quot; this drug contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with heredi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ char@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency of this drug should not be taken . &quot;
the overall incidence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the adi@@ at@@ adi@@ n group as in the placebo group .
&quot; infants aged 6 to 23 were the most common adverse events reported in placebo , diar@@ rhe@@ a ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2.3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ( 2.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in an additional study , no adverse events were observed in patients aged between 6 and 11 years at a one @-@ time dose of 2.5 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n solution . &quot;
at the recommended doses the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see section 5.2 ) were comparable in children &apos;s and adult population .
&quot; in controlled clinical studies , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents was no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seas@@ on@@ ally and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may alternatively also occur in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s depending on the duration of the symptoms . &quot;
&quot; as shown on the overall score of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the stress caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; spread of this limited metabol@@ ising phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ sian ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
&quot; since A@@ eri@@ us &apos;s solution for taking the same concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n contains , no bio@@ equivalent study was required and it is expected that it corresponds to the sy@@ rup and the tablets . &quot;

&quot; in June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially announced the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) to withdraw its application for the prevention of avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influenza in adults and elderly people . &quot;
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and older people to protect against flu caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influenza A virus .
&quot; this is a special type of vaccine , which should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; influenza pan@@ de@@ mic erup@@ ts when a new trunk of the flu virus appears , which can easily spread from man to person , because humans have no immunity ( no protection ) against it . &quot;
&quot; once the vaccine is administered , the immune system recognis@@ es the parts contained in the vaccine as &quot; foreign &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the immune system is later able to form antibodies in a contact with a flu virus of this trunk . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , the membrane shell of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which recognizes the human body as foreign body ) , was puri@@ fied and used as a constitu@@ ent of the vaccine . &quot;
inspection of some of the study centres showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
&quot; as a result , the scope of the clinical data base was insufficient to evaluate the safety of the vaccine in order to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; should you take part in a clinical trial and require further information regarding your treatment , please contact your attending physician . &quot;
&quot; if you wish further information on the basis of the recommendations of the CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immuno@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immuno@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who cannot swallow the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution for intake , but it cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as the safety of this combination has not been studied . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ a should only be prescribed if the doctor has examined which anti@@ viral drugs the patient has previously taken , and the lik@@ el@@ ihood of the virus to respond to the medicine . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral drugs . &quot;
&quot; for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ a is based on body weight . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , A@@ gener@@ ase reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps them at a low level . &quot;
&quot; not to cure AIDS , however , can delay damage to the immune system and therefore also delay the development of HIV @-@ related infections and diseases . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the medication A@@ gener@@ ase , with low dose , was compared with other prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who had previously taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with no det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change in viral load after treatment .
&quot; in the studies with patients who had previously not taken any prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / ml compared to placebo , but A@@ gener@@ a was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but with the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , very few responded to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the treatment with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment as effective as other prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; in the patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger release of the viral load after four weeks than with the patients who received their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ a ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash and fatigue . &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ a must not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients , the St. John &apos;s wort ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicines that are broken down in the same way as A@@ gener@@ ase and are harmful to the blood in high concentrations in the blood . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines for HIV , patients who take A@@ gener@@ ase are the risk of oste@@ o@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( death of bone tissue ) or an immune activation syndrome ( symptoms of an infection caused by the re@@ juven@@ ating immune system ) . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs used to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee noted that the benefit of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously not taken any prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors is not proven . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was initially admitted under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; since only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot;
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission granted authorisation to the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited for the placing of A@@ gener@@ a in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ then@@ mer ( PI ) pre@@ treated adults and children over 4 years . &quot;
&quot; usually , A@@ gener@@ a capsules should be administered to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ ster of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the use of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r should take into account the individual viral resistance pattern and the treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ a capsules is 600 mg Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; 2 If ap@@ gener@@ a capsules are applied without the rein@@ forcing additive of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of ap@@ gener@@ a ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ a capsules is 20 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg am@@ on@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not studied in children . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the lack of data on harm@@ lessness and efficacy ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function disorder should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disorders at 300 mg twice daily .
&quot; simultaneous use should be performed with care in patients with mild or moderate liver function disorder , in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ a must not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width , and also represent sub@@ strates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 I@@ so@@ enz@@ ym@@ atic 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used for am@@ on@@ avi@@ r reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ a or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; usually , A@@ gener@@ a capsules should be used together with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal outcome .
&quot; for the case of simultaneous anti @-@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information on this medicine . &quot;
patients with reduced liver function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver dysfunction using anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids that are metabol@@ ised via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; since the metabolism of H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , an concur@@ rent administration of A@@ gener@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies , including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; 4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available . &quot;
patients who use these medicines at the same time may be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the efficacy of hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tives may be altered , but the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored for withdrawal symptoms , especially if low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ co@@ l content of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient populations . &quot;
&quot; if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) , A@@ gener@@ ase should be removed in duration 5 . &quot;
&quot; patients who received anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors were reported on the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an ex@@ a@@ dis@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . &quot;
many of the patients had other diseases where drugs were needed which could be associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
&quot; B. higher age , and associated with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; in hem@@ ophi@@ lic patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ at@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis occur . &quot;
&quot; at the time of initiation of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections leading to severe clinical condition or worsen@@ ing of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although a multi@@ fac@@ torial eti@@ ology is adopted ( including the use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol use , heavy immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose in particular were reported in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ strates with a low therapeutic width of A@@ gener@@ a must not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width , and also present sub@@ strates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 I@@ so@@ enz@@ ym@@ atic 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ a with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be given along with drugs whose active ingredients are primarily associated with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development . &quot;
&quot; in the attempt to compensate the degra@@ ded plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , adverse effects on the liver were observed . &quot;
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
&quot; if a patient already takes St. John &apos;s wort , the am@@ on@@ a@@ virus mirror and , if possible , check the viral load and remove the St. John &apos;s wort . &quot;
dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not required if nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
&quot; for C@@ MA@@ x , it is 30 % lower for C@@ MA@@ x , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies , dos@@ ages of 600 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were used twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , demonstrating the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme . &quot;
52 % lower if am@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) was administered .
the C@@ mine values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma that have been achieved in combination of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with calcium ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , a close @-@ mes@@ hed monitoring is recommended , as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study was carried out for the use of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but is suggested by Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in for at least one hour apart from Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) . &quot;
therefore in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose adjustment is required .
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z combined with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors would be low .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggests that ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in might reduce serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; if these drugs should be used at the same time , caution is advised as Del@@ a@@ vir@@ din could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels . &quot;
caution is required if these medicines are used together ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be performed as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ virus is difficult .
simultaneous administration of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin resulted in an increase in plasma concentrations ( AU@@ C ) of Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % and a rise in the side effects associated with Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin along with A@@ gener@@ a , a reduction of the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin will be at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data available for this . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin have not been performed but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase in the C@@ MA@@ x of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day without simultaneous application of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines that are listed below may also interact with sub@@ strates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 if they are used together with A@@ gener@@ a , possibly to interact with them . &quot;
patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these medicines when used in combination with A@@ gener@@ a .
based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors it is advisable that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da should not be taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase as it may result in resor@@ ption problems .
&quot; simultaneous use of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ s@@ ants known as enzyme duc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; serum levels of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine ,
&quot; simultaneous intake of A@@ gener@@ ase can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and reinforce the side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days to subjects , the flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels rose by approximately 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the simultaneous gift of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r together with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly influenced by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , distinctive increases in plasma levels can be expected at the same time as A@@ gener@@ a . &quot;
&quot; since plasma levels of these H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy , including a hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of these drugs is not recommended with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; a more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ zation of the mirrors is recommended , as the plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased while simultaneously offering am@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , A@@ gener@@ a must not be used together with oral Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) , while caution is advised concur@@ r@@ ently with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot;
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ inhibit@@ ors indicates a possible rise in Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am plasma levels around the 3 to 4 fa@@ che .
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored for withdrawal symptoms , especially if low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered . &quot;
&quot; because of the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation is currently given as to how the Am@@ on@@ a@@ virus dose is adjusted , when am@@ on@@ avi@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one . &quot;
&quot; with simultaneous gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of de@@ bil@@ itating or strengthening the anti @-@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , therefore alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are recommended . &quot;
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( e.g. Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended while offering A@@ gener@@ a ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; during pregnancy , this medicine may only be applied after careful consideration of potential benefits for the mother compared to possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in the milk @-@ lac@@ tic rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to people in breast milk . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered from the one to the end of the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a reduced increase of 12 body weight during the lac@@ tation period . &quot;
the further development of offspring including fertility and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r to the mother animal .
A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s inno@@ c@@ ence was studied in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; most adverse events associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were moderate to moderate , occurred early and rarely performed at the treatment break . &quot;
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether or not they are associated with the intake of A@@ gener@@ ase or another at the same time to the HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the side effects mentioned below come from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors received 1200 mg of A@@ gener@@ a twice daily . &quot;
events ( grade 2 to 4 ) were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as in connection with the study medication and performed in more than 1 % of patients as well as in the treatment of occurring laboratory changes ( grade 3 to 4 ) .
&quot; anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with re@@ distribution of body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including loss of peripheral and fat tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ sal fat accumulation . &quot;
&quot; among 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral not previously treated persons treated with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ i@@ v@@ u@@ din / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ u@@ dine over a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( sti@@ cking ) was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ s reported 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients under in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; skin rash usually was moderate to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ ule nature , with or without it@@ ching and occurred spontaneously during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r had to be canc@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ o@@ arthritis cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV infection or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; at the time of initiation of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with PI pre @-@ treated patients who received 600 mg A@@ gener@@ a twice daily with low dos@@ sed k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) , were very common in patients who received A@@ gener@@ ase along with low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the patient is to be observed on signs of an intoxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate necessary support measures . &quot;
&quot; am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active centre of the HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , thereby preventing the processing of viral g@@ ag@@ - and ga@@ g pol@@ - poly@@ proteins with the result of formation of un@@ ripe , non @-@ infectious viral particles . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro versus HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was investigated in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes . &quot;
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ entri@@ c concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells
the connection between the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
&quot; in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral not previously treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages , the mut@@ ations described in other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r were observed only rarely . &quot;
&quot; for sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti @-@ retro@@ viral patients who received 700@@ mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in the study ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to 48 , with 14 isol@@ ate gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined . &quot;
&quot; a gen@@ otyp@@ ical analysis of 13 out of 14 children , in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , showed resistance patterns , similar to those in adults . &quot;
&quot; L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , I@@ 5@@ V , I@@ 5@@ V , I@@ 5@@ V , I@@ 5@@ V , I@@ 5@@ V , I@@ 5@@ V , I@@ 5@@ V , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 9@@ 3@@ L / M . &quot;
&quot; in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) in patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred over 96 weeks , the following prot@@ e@@ as@@ hic mut@@ ations : &quot;
&quot; based on gen@@ otyp@@ ical resistance testing , gen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mutation V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , I@@ 5@@ A / L / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M /
&quot; the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ations may be subject to changes due to additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests . &quot;
phen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to assess the activity of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or isol@@ ates .
companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
&quot; each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross @-@ resistance against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data for cross @-@ resistance between am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; on base of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral not previously treated patients , in which a Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus @-@ containing scheme failed ( one of them showed resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) and zo@@ di@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ sely , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ ase @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; maintaining this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
early abor@@ tion of a se@@ eding therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits that can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
&quot; the receipt of the effectiveness of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study , with PI pre @-@ treated adults after vi@@ ro@@ logical failure ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; one hundred and sixty @-@ three ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
the primary analysis revealed the non @-@ superi@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the virus load ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the virus load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks with a non @-@ density threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
&quot; the evidence of the efficacy of un@@ bi@@ ased gen@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials involving 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were pre@@ treated with PI . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase Solution for intake and capsules in dos@@ ages of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
no low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given at the same time ; the majority of patients previously treated with PI had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ a .
&quot; after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients enrolled in the study had a plasma HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration of &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the bas@@ eline value . &quot;
&quot; 19 Based on these data , the benefit of &quot; un@@ bi@@ ased &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be considered in therapy optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children . &quot;
&quot; after oral administration , the average duration ( max ) to the maximum serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
&quot; at 50@@ 8 % , C@@ MA@@ x has been reduced by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; administration of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by the intake , although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of resor@@ ption . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active ingredient in the plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that represents the active part , probably unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components varies during dosing intervals depending on the overall drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the area of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered with caution when they are given at the same time with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to similar daily am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
am@@ on@@ avi@@ r is 14 % less bio@@ avail@@ ble from the solution than from the capsules ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase Solution and A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram base .
&quot; also , the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , so the effect of kidney dysfunction should be low on the elimination of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
these treatment schemes lead to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those who can be obtained twice daily without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r after a dose of 1200 mg .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas oc@@ cured in male animals , which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8 @-@ times ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily dose of 1200 mg am@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; from the actual exposure data on humans , both from clinical studies as well as from the therapeutic application , there were little indications of the acceptance of clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mutation test ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test of rats and chromos@@ om@@ en@@ ab@@ err@@ ation test in human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , am@@ on@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical daily life by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; until now , no significant liver toxic@@ ity in patients has been observed in clinical studies , neither during the administration of A@@ gener@@ a nor after the end of the treatment . &quot;
toxic@@ ity studies in juven@@ iles that were treated at an age of 4 days showed high mortality in both the control and the animals treated with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , which indicate a delayed development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If ap@@ gener@@ a capsules are applied without the rein@@ forcing additive of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of ap@@ gener@@ a ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ a capsules is 20 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg am@@ on@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; simultaneous use should be performed with caution in patients with weak or slight liver function disorder , in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ a should be suspended in duration 27 , if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; an increased risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development . &quot;
&quot; for C@@ MA@@ x , it is 30 % lower for C@@ MA@@ x , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the C@@ mine values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma that have been achieved in combination of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with calcium ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , a close @-@ mes@@ hed monitoring is recommended , as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known . &quot;
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z combined with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors would be low .
caution is required if these medicines are used together ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be performed as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ virus is difficult .
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin along with A@@ gener@@ a , at least half of the recommended dose is 31 , although no clinical data are available for this . &quot;
&quot; serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@
&quot; in a clinical study in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days to subjects , the flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels rose by approximately 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; with simultaneous gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of de@@ bil@@ itating or strengthening the anti @-@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ tho @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg of E@@ thin@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg of Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) led to a decrease in the AU@@ C and C@@ mine of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
&quot; during pregnancy , this medicine may only be applied after careful consideration of potential benefits for the mother compared to possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the em@@ or@@ estation in the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during the lac@@ tation period . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s inno@@ c@@ ence was studied in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the patient is to be observed on signs of an intoxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate necessary support measures . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro versus HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was investigated in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes . &quot;
the 50 % inhibit@@ ory concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; conver@@ sely , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ ase @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; maintaining this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; based on these data , therapy optimization in PI @-@ treated children should be considered as expected benefit of &quot; un@@ bi@@ ased &quot; A@@ gener@@ a . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components varies during dosing intervals depending on the overall drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the area of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .. &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered with caution when they are given at the same time with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; also , the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore , the effect of kidney dysfunction should be low on the elimination of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;

toxic@@ ity studies in juven@@ iles that were treated at an age of 4 days showed high mortality in both the control and the animals treated with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; these results suggest that in juven@@ iles the metabol@@ isation routes are not yet fully mature , so that am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution for intake is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ then@@ mer ( PI ) pre@@ treated adults and children over 4 years . &quot;
the benefits of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ er &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inser@@ tion was not covered by neither PI pre @-@ treated patients nor PI @-@ treated patients .
&quot; the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
patients should be able to swallow the capsules once they are able to stop taking the solution for inhal@@ ation ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg am@@ on@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , as no dose recommendation can be given for the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase solution for depos@@ iting and low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patient populations . &quot;
&quot; although a dose adjustment for am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not deemed necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inser@@ ting patients with kidney failure is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of the high propylene gly@@ co@@ l content , A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in pregnant women and children under the age of 4 , pregnant women , patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure . &quot;
simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these drugs and potentially cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as ( z ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ a or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of 47 of a transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; for some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available . &quot;
&quot; if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; an increased risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug @-@ 49 dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; in hem@@ ophi@@ lic patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ at@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis occur . &quot;
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development . &quot;
&quot; for C@@ MA@@ x , it is 30 % lower for C@@ MA@@ x , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous intake of A@@ gener@@ ase can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and lead to associated side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am &apos;s plasma concentrations are expected to significantly increase by Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot;
the potential risk for humans is not known . A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s solution to intake may not be applied during pregnancy due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us to the contained propylene gly@@ co@@ l ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; in the milk @-@ lac@@ tic rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to people in breast milk . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the in@@ dent@@ ing in the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in 55 body weight during the lac@@ tation period . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s inno@@ c@@ ence was studied in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether or not they are associated with the intake of A@@ gener@@ ase or another at the same time to the HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral not previously treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages , the mut@@ ations described in other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r were observed only rarely . &quot;
early abor@@ tion of a sag@@ ging 60 therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits that can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
&quot; 62 Based on these data , the benefit of &quot; un@@ bi@@ ased &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be considered in therapy optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg for a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large c@@ ousin volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .

&quot; − If any of the listed side effects may affect you significantly or notice side effects indicated not in this consumer information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
your doctor will normally instruc@@ t you to use A@@ gener@@ a capsules along with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to enhance the effect of A@@ gener@@ a .
the use of A@@ gener@@ ase will be based on the individual viral resistance test carried out by your doctor and your treatment history .
inform your doctor if you are suffering from any of the above mentioned diseases or taking any of the drugs mentioned above .
&quot; if your doctor has recommended that you take A@@ gener@@ ase capsules along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to strengthen the effect ( boo@@ ster ) , make sure that before the treatment you have read the user information about Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r carefully . &quot;
there is also no adequate information to recommend the use of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to gain effect in children aged 4 to 12 years or in general in patients under 50 kg body weight .

&quot; the treatment frequency and duration of treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease to be treated . • With small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream is to be applied three times a week for six weeks . &quot;
&quot; before bed@@ time , the cream is thin @-@ lay@@ ered to the affected areas of the skin , so that it remains sufficiently long ( about eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed off . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( the same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies on 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks each . &quot;
&quot; • Al@@ dar@@ a was also studied in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies in which patients were treated for six weeks , and Al@@ dar@@ a or placebo either daily or five times a week . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete removal of tum@@ ors after 12 weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies on a total of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ oses .
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than placebo . • Pati@@ ents treated with Al@@ dar@@ a were 15 % to 52 % in patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a , but only 3 % to 80 % in patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group . &quot;
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
&quot; clin@@ ically typical , non @-@ hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ otic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic nucle@@ at@@ os ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or on the scal@@ p in immuno@@ competent adults , if the size or number of lesi@@ ons limit the efficacy and / or the acceptance of a cr@@ y@@ otherapy and other topical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable . &quot;
&quot; Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday before going to bed and leave 6 to 10 hours on the skin . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine can continue until all the visible asc@@ ents have disappeared in the genital or peripheral area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period . &quot;
an inter@@ ruption in the treatment sequence described above should be considered when intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see Section 4.4 ) or when an infection is observed in the treatment area .
&quot; if follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , the treated lesi@@ ons were only completely healed , another therapy should be started ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if a dose is om@@ itted , the patient should apply the cream as soon as he / she notices this and then proceed with the usual therapy plan . &quot;
apply I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in a thin layer and rub in the cleaned skin area infected with cow@@ ard until the cream is completely dra@@ ined .
&quot; in these patients , there should be a balance between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible worsen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease . &quot;
there should be a balance between the benefits of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with potential organ rejection or gra@@ ft versus host reaction .
&quot; in other studies where no daily pre @-@ famili@@ arity was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and a case with a stri@@ k@@ ness leading to circumc@@ ision were observed . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , severe local skin irritation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irritation ( see section 4.2 ) has been observed in rare cases , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or caused a temporary physical impairment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the output of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine , which necess@@ itated emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area . &quot;
&quot; in order to apply I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od creme immediately after treatment with other cut@@ aneous inj@@ ections in the genital and peripheral area , no clinical experience has yet to be found . &quot;
&quot; limited data points to an increased rate of clin@@ ker reductions in HIV positive patients , but I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream has shown a lesser efficacy in this group of patients regarding the elimination of clin@@ ching war@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , nose , lips , or hair@@ line was not studied . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions decreases generally during therapy or the reactions form after completion of the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary because of the discomfort of the patient or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment break can be made several days . &quot;
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
&quot; as currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after treatment are available , other appropriate therapies should be considered in case of super@@ fici@@ ent bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas . &quot;
&quot; in patients with recur@@ rent and pre@@ treated BC@@ Cs , no clinical experience is present , therefore the application for previously treated tum@@ ors is not recommended . &quot;
data from an open clinical study indicate that in large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) a lower probability of response to i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy exists .
&quot; i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not studied for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lip@@ id . &quot;
very limited data on the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis in anatom@@ ical places outside of the face and scal@@ p are available .
&quot; the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ ose on the under@@ arms and hands do not support the effectiveness in this application , therefore such an application is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions occur frequently , but these reactions usually decrease in intensity over the course of the therapy or go back after the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream . &quot;
&quot; if the local skin reactions cause large discomfort to the patient or are very strong , treatment may be suspended for a few days . &quot;
&quot; from the data of an open clinical trial , patients with more than 8 active lesi@@ ons showed a lower full cure rate than patients with less than 8 lesi@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; due to the immune @-@ stimulating properties , i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied with caution in patients receiving an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; animal studies show no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; although quanti@@ fiable serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) have been quanti@@ fied either once or after several times , no recommendation can be applied during the lac@@ tation period . &quot;
the most frequently shared and considered prob@@ able or possibly associated with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od creme in the trials with three times weekly treatment were local reactions in the treatment of clin@@ ching ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
&quot; among the most commonly reported and as prob@@ able or possibly associated with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cr@@ ème related side effects include complaints at the application site , with an incidence of 28.@@ 1 % . &quot;
adverse events reported by 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Cream from a placebo @-@ controlled phase III clinical study are shown below .
&quot; the most common , as prob@@ able or possibly associated with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od creme in connection , were in these studies a reaction to the application site ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) . &quot;
adverse events reported by 25@@ 2 in placebo @-@ controlled Phase III clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Cream were listed below .
&quot; according to the test plan , evaluation of clinical signs showed that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with three @-@ week long treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od creme frequently resulted in local skin reactions including ery@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , Ex@@ c@@ ori@@ ation / Sh@@ ore ( 23 % ) and ede@@ ma ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; according to the test plan , evaluation of clinical signs showed that in these studies five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od creme frequently resulted in severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe erosion ( 13 % ) , and heavy she@@ ar formation and en@@ rol@@ ment ( 19 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials investigating the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ osis , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area . &quot;
&quot; the accidental one @-@ time oral intake of 200 mg i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the contents of about 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever . &quot;
&quot; the clin@@ ically most serious side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted of hyp@@ ot@@ onia which norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluid . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , systemic concentrations of alpha interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected following the topical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od . &quot;
&quot; in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies , it was shown that efficacy in relation to a complete healing of the clin@@ ching war@@ ts was clearly superior in a placebo treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment . &quot;
&quot; at 60 % of the total 119 patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , patients were completely healed ; this was 20 % of the patients treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
&quot; complete healing was achieved in 23 % of 157 patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , compared to 5 % of 161 patients treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od on five times a week over 6 weeks was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials . &quot;
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed individual primary cell carcin@@ oma with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
&quot; the data from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years showed that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients had been clin@@ ically cured and this remained for 48 months . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od on three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials . &quot;
&quot; patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ otic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic lesi@@ ons within a cohesi@@ ve 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on the uncomfortable scal@@ p or face . &quot;
the one @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical healing after one or two lines of treatment .
&quot; the approved indications of external clin@@ ching , acute ker@@ at@@ ose and super @-@ cell carcin@@ oma normally do not appear in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and were therefore not examined . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a cream was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies of children aged 2 to 15 with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) . &quot;
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in the dos@@ ages investigated there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or respectively ) .
a minimal systemic absorption of the 5 % i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream by the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose was observed during the three @-@ week use during 16 weeks .
&quot; the highest drug concentrations in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and bet@@ ru@@ gen 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 dispos@@ able bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot;
the calculated apparent half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the 2@@ h half @-@ life time after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in an earlier study ; this indicates prolonged retention of the drug in the skin .
the data on systemic exposure showed that the absorption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od after topical application on MC @-@ affected skin from patients aged 6 @-@ 12 was low and comparable to that with healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ fici@@ ent bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ le@@ en weight in a four @-@ month study of der@@ mal toxic@@ ity ; a study conducted for the der@@ mal application for four months resulted in no similar effects in mice .
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice on three days a week did not indu@@ ce tumours in the application area .
&quot; the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a small systemic absorption of the human skin and is not mut@@ agen@@ ic , there is a risk for man due to systemic exposure to be very low . &quot;
&quot; the tum@@ ors appeared in the group of mice treated with the active cream , earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR . &quot;
&quot; it may harm other people even if these same symptoms have as you . − If any of the listed side effects may neg@@ atively affect you or notice side effects that are not stated in this manual information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
● Membran@@ e pads ( Con@@ dy@@ l@@ om@@ ata ac@@ umin@@ ata ) formed on the skin in the area of gen@@ itals ( gen@@ itals ) and anus ( anus ) . this is a frequently encountered slow @-@ growing form of skin cancer with very low probability of spread to other parts of the body .
&quot; if left untreated , it can lead to distor@@ tions , especially in the face - therefore early detection and treatment is important . &quot;
&quot; ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ oses are rough areas of the skin , which occur in people who were exposed to the sun during their previous life . &quot;
Al@@ dar@@ a should only be used for flat @-@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ os in the face and on the scal@@ p in patients with a healthy immune system where your doctor has decided that Al@@ dar@@ a is the most suitable treatment for you .

&quot; the following non @-@ neuro@@ logical symptoms of the M@@ PS I can occur : increased liver , stiff joints , which complic@@ ate movements , decreased lung volume , heart and eye disease . &quot;
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
&quot; the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place in a hospital or clinic with re@@ vit@@ alizing devices , and patients may need appropriate medicines before they are administered in order to prevent an allergic reaction . &quot;

&quot; in the study , mainly the safety of the drug was investigated , but its effectiveness was measured ( by examining its effect in the reduction of G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and regarding the size of the liver ) . &quot;
&quot; in children under five years , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal sized liver at the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headache , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , pain sensation , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion site . &quot;
&quot; very common side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement of lung function ) , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may be highly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
&quot; every year , the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will check out all new information that may be known , and if necessary update this summary . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is a producer who preserves Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me regarding the reactions to the in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
&quot; in June 2003 , the European Commission granted approval to Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. for the transport of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of the human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , egg stock of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be done by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
&quot; the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient toler@@ ates this , every 15 minutes in single steps can be increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients . &quot;
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been determined and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that are defined as any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment in which rehabilitation centres for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase 3 study , it is expected that nearly all patients form Ig@@ G antibodies against larv@@ ae , usually within 3 months from the start of treatment . &quot;
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; since there is little experience in resum@@ ing treatment after a longer period of inter@@ ruption , the risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions has to be cau@@ tious following an inter@@ ruption of the treatment . &quot;
to treat the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions 60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medication ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ ren@@ etic ) .
&quot; in case of mild or moderate in@@ fusion , the treatment should be considered with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in case of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are brought down , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered . &quot;
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous reaction occurred .
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or pro@@ ca@@ ine , because there is a potential risk of interfer@@ ing with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular inclusion of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; animal experiments do not allow direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; since no data is available to new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to larv@@ ae on breast milk , it is recommended not to breast@@ feed during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
adverse events in clinical trials were mainly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that were observed in 53 % of patients in phase 3 ( treatment duration of up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) .
&quot; adverse drug reactions related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during the Phase 3 study and their extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older , are reported in the following table according to the following frequencies ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) . &quot;
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related participation of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respiratory still@@ ness and facial o@@ ede@@ ma ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children Un@@ wanted drug effects associated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study involving a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with mainly severe follow @-@ up form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in most patients it occurred within 3 months of the onset of treatment with a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version , in which patients aged under 5 years mostly came to a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version ( average after 26 days versus 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older ) . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the Phase 3 study ( or until a premature departure from the study ) , 13 / 45 patients were not detected by radio@@ immun@@ op@@ aci@@ ation ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say , among them 3 patients , in whom there was never a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version . &quot;
patients with a lack of low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the G@@ AG mirror in urine while in patients with high antibody ti@@ ters a variable reduction of G@@ AG in urine was observed .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro that did not seem to affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in urine .
&quot; the presence of antibodies did not appear related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions , although the incidence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies . &quot;
the reason for the enzyme therapy is in one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated substrate and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient recovery of enz@@ ym@@ atic activity .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the circulation and taken from cells to ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely via man@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were studied in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study to 45 patients aged 6 @-@ 43 . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited to study the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients were of the mean phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype . &quot;
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute walking distance in the 6 minute walk test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me for another 3.5 years ( 18@@ 2 weeks ) .
&quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in lung function and the ability to pay , which is shown in the following table . &quot;
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 18@@ 2 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as from the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of FE@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant over this period and the total lung volume increases further propor@@ tionally to the size of growing children .
&quot; of the 26 patients with a H@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) reached normal liver size until the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; within the first 4 weeks , a clear decrease of the G@@ AG mirror in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) was detected , which remained constant until the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; in terms of the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation between the patient , which was taken into account by using a combined end point , clin@@ ically significant changes across 5 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
a one @-@ year open Phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were studied in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with severe tra@@ verse form and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up form ) .
&quot; in four patients , the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg for the last 26 weeks due to increased G@@ ag@@ - mirror in the urine in week 22 . &quot;
&quot; in several patients , a size increase ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) were determined after the Z @-@ S@@ core for this age group The younger patients with the severe tra@@ verse form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed a normal mental development speed , whereas in older patients with severe follow @-@ up form only limited or no progress in cognitive development had been observed . &quot;
&quot; in a phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosage schemes were carried out on the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test . &quot;
&quot; intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
dosing schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative in patients who have difficulty with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosage schemes is equivalent .
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the drug will be updated . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged under 5 years was similar to older and less severely affected patients .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in a unique gift , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data does not reveal any particular danger to humans . &quot;

this register will provide long @-@ term safety and efficacy information for patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment .
&quot; in patients suffering from M@@ PS I , there is an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase , which cle@@ aves certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans ) , either in small amounts before or this enzyme is missing completely . &quot;
if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to any of the ingredients of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if you have encountered a severe allergic reaction to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is any side effect occurring during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4 &quot; What side effects are possible &quot; ) .
&quot; when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines , please inform your doctor if you are taking medicines that contain chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or pro@@ ca@@ ine , because there is a possible risk of a reduced effect of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or taken recently , including non @-@ prescription medicines . &quot;
instructions for handling - th@@ inning and application The concentrate for making an in@@ fusion solution must be dil@@ uted prior to use and is intended for intraven@@ ous use ( see information for doctors and medical professionals ) .
&quot; the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased , if the patient toler@@ ates this , every 15 minutes gradually increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I@@ - conditional participation of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , serious reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respiratory still@@ ness and facial ede@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; very common ( occurrence of more than 1 out of 10 patients ) : • headache • nausea • abdominal pain • Skin rash • joint disease , joint pain , back pain , pain in arms and legs • increased pulse • hyper@@ ton@@ ia • less oxygen in the blood • reaction to the in@@ fusion &quot;

preparation of the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in@@ fusion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • to determine the number of th@@ inn@@ ed water bottles to be th@@ inn@@ ed according to body weight of the individual patient .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine against cancer ) in patients who do not yet receive chemotherapy ( medicine against cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant ) cancer has already spread to other parts of the body or is likely spread easily to other parts of the body . • advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer that does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ um cells .
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used as sole therapy for patients who have not previously been treated , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; to reduce side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid and fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
&quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the gift of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , an additional &quot; anti@@ eme@@ tics &quot; ( medicine against vom@@ iting ) and fluids ( to prevent fluid deficiency ) should be given before or after the gift of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; patients whose blood counts change or where certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , removed or decreased . &quot;
the active form of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed thus slow@@ s the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing .
&quot; the conversion of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed into its active form is easier to fit in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active life in cancer cells . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of malign@@ ant ple@@ ural cancer , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who had not previously received chemotherapy for their disease . &quot;
the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with a local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ axel ( another medicine against cancer ) in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer .
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another medicine against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had not previously received chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
&quot; patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin lived an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared to 9.@@ 3 months in the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; patients who had previously received chemotherapy had an average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8.3 months , compared to 7.@@ 9 months in doc@@ et@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , however , patients in which cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells , showed longer survival in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta than with the comparison medication . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted authorisation to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.@@ V. for the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; each sm@@ elling bottle has to be dissolved with 4,@@ 2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml . &quot;
the corresponding volume of the necessary wick is removed and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is indicated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) administered intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion for a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients with non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ oma , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid must be given the day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed gift as well as on the day after the treatment . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose . &quot;
patients also need to receive an intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) a week before the first p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed dose as well as after every third treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients receiving P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , a complete blood sample should be created before each application , including a differentiation of leu@@ ko@@ cytes and plat@@ el@@ et counting . &quot;
&quot; alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate Tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Alan@@ ine Tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose examination must take place taking the account of the Na@@ di@@ rs of the blood image or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the pre@@ - h@@ ating therapy cycles . &quot;
&quot; after recovery , patients must be treated according to indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria reflect the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 bleeding .
&quot; should patients develop non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ grade 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA until the patient has the value before treatment &quot;
treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be canc@@ eled if a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity level 3 or 4 occurs in patients after 2 dose reduc@@ ti@@ o- or so@@ - fort in the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies did not indicate that in patients aged 65 and over the age of 65 patients aged under 65 have an increased risk of side effects .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to insufficient data on harm@@ lessness and effectiveness .
&quot; in clinical studies , no dose adjustment was necessary in patients with a cre@@ atine @-@ in @-@ clearing ≥ 45 ml / min , which exceed the dose adjustment recommended for all patients . &quot;
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin Limit and / or Tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase values from &gt; the 3,@@ 0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not investigated specifically in the studies . &quot;
patients must be monitored with regard to bone mar@@ row and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed should not be administered to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ phy@@ top@@ us again reaches a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number has reached a value of ≥ 100.000 cells / mm ³ .
&quot; dose reduction for further cycles is based on the needle of the absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number and maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity as observed in the previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of Grade 3 / 4 ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity , such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was treated , if a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place . &quot;
&quot; therefore , all patients treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must be instructed to apply fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic measure for the reduction of treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to medium ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( N@@ SA@@ IDs ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ sali@@ - cy@@ l@@ lic acid ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) must be avoided at least 2 days before the therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; all patients , for which therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , should avoid taking N@@ SA@@ IDs with long half @-@ time for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients in which these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre@@ existing high blood pressure or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid retention in the trans@@ cellular space , a drainage of the ergometer before the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment is considered . &quot;
&quot; cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were reported in clinical studies with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed occasionally , when this drug was commonly administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic agent . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated live vaccine ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; as the possibility of ir@@ reversible lesi@@ on of reproductive capacity by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed consists , men should be pointed out before the treatment g@@ inn to obtain advice on sperm conservation . &quot;
&quot; in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non@@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ IDs , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can lead to reduced P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ex@@ cre@@ tion with the result of increased occurrence of side effects . &quot;
caution is therefore advised if patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) are used in high doses of N@@ SA@@ IDs or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid .
&quot; i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses for at least 2 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed be avoided ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since no data on interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ IDs is available with long half @-@ value such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , simultaneous use with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must be avoided on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed . &quot;
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ agulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) when the decision was taken to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; there are no data for the use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed in pregnant women , but as with other an@@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites severe birth defects are expected during pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed should not be applied during pregnancy , except if necessary and after careful consideration of the benefits for the mother and the risk of fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to reproductive capacity by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed consists , men should be advised before the start of the treatment to obtain advice on how to block the sperm count . &quot;
it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed is transferred to breast milk and unwanted effects in the breast@@ fed baby cannot be excluded .

clin@@ ically relevant toxic@@ ity reported in ≥ 1 % and ≤ 5 % ( often ) of patients who received random@@ ised c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed were included :
clin@@ ically relevant toxic@@ ity reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients reported ran@@ - dom@@ ed c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed were included :
&quot; severe cardiovascular and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular insul@@ t and tran@@ sit@@ ory isch@@ em@@ ic attacks were reported in clinics with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , which is usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic agent . &quot;

in clinical studies patients with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment sometimes reported cases of sometimes fatal inter@@ sti@@ tial pneum@@ oni@@ tis with respiratory failure .
there was reported cases of acute ren@@ al failure in case of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chemotherapy ( see Section 4.4 ) .
cases of radiation pneum@@ oni@@ tis were reported in patients who were be@@ amed prior to during or after their P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed therapy ( see Section 4.4 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ) is an ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ fol@@ ate that ex@@ erts its effect by interrup@@ ting weight @-@ based metabolic processes necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
&quot; in vitro studies showed that P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed acts as an anti@@ fol@@ ate with multiple targets by blocking the thy@@ mi@@ dy@@ lat@@ ox@@ th@@ ase ( TS ) , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ fol@@ at@@ reduc@@ t@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) and gly@@ c@@ ami@@ dri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ ot@@ id@@ for@@ e- my@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) . &quot;
&quot; E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multi@@ center , random@@ ized , easy @-@ to @-@ blind Phase 3 study of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin with malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ otheli@@ oma showed that patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had a clin@@ ically significant benefit of a medi@@ an 2.8 months prolonged survival compared to patients with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received the test medication in the treatment arm ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ ea ) in connection with malign@@ ant ple@@ ural cancer was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 2@@ 12 patients ) compared to the u@@ bi@@ quit@@ ous C@@ is@@ pla@@ in@@ tin arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two treatment arms resulted in an improvement of the lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a deterioration of lung function over time in the control arm .
&quot; a multi@@ center , random@@ ized , open Phase III study with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA versus doc@@ et@@ axel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC ( Int@@ ent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and from 7.@@ 9 months in patients treated with doc@@ et@@ axel ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on the overall survival occurred in favor of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 0.@@ 61 , 6.2 versus 7.@@ 4 months , adapted HR = 1,@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1,@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) . &quot;
&quot; limited data from a random@@ ized , controlled Phase 3 study showed that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) were similar to P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre @-@ treatment by doc@@ et@@ axel . &quot;
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analysis of the IT@@ T population and support non @-@ superi@@ ority of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination against gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination .

the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed after administration had been examined in 4@@ 26 cancer patients with different solid tumours in doses ranging from 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in in@@ fusion zones over a period of 10 minutes .
&quot; P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed is mainly ex@@ cre@@ ted in the urine , and 70 % to 90 % of the administered dose is found unchanged in the urine within 24 hours after use . &quot;
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed has a total of 9@@ 1.8 ml / min and the half @-@ time in the plasma is 3.5 hours in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 90 ml / min ) .

&quot; all@@ i must not be used by children and adolescents under 18 , as there are not enough data on efficacy and safety . &quot;
&quot; however , since Or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ally resor@@ bed , it is not necessary to adjust the dosage in the elderly or in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function . &quot;
• Super@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other components • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ mature treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see sections 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the lik@@ el@@ ihood of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) may increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich meal or fat @-@ rich diet .
&quot; since weight reduction in diabetes can be associated with improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i because the dosage of the anti@@ diabe@@ tic must be adjusted if necessary . &quot;
patients who use all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or high cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dose of this medication needs to be adjusted .
it is recommended to take additional pregnancy @-@ prevention measures in order to prevent the possible failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) .
in a study on drug interactions as well as in several cases with simultaneous application of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in a reduction of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma levels was observed .
&quot; in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ values ( international normal@@ ised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in most patients treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with or@@ list@@ at , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K , as well as beta carot@@ ene , remained in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be advised to take supplements of mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin preparations before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin up@@ take ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; following the addition of one single dose of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a limited number of healthy volunteers who simultaneously received or@@ list@@ at received a minor decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration . &quot;
&quot; animal experiments showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic , fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are linked to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , as the absorption of bi@@ ased fat is prevented . &quot;
the gastro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
&quot; the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data ) . &quot;
&quot; the incidence of known side effects identified after the launch of or@@ list@@ at is unknown , as these events were voluntarily sur@@ vey@@ ed by a population of uncertain size . &quot;
† It is plau@@ sible that the treatment with all@@ i can lead to anxiety in terms of possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
&quot; single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days to normal , overweight and obes@@ e subjects without significant clinical findings . &quot;
&quot; in the majority of cases reported after the launch of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose , no side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
&quot; based on studies on humans and animals , any systemic effects that can be traced back to the li@@ pas@@ ase properties of or@@ list@@ at can be assumed . &quot;
the therapeutic effect starts in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine through co@@ valent bonding to the active ser@@ in @-@ rest of the ga@@ stri@@ an and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atic li@@ pas@@ s .
&quot; clinical trials were derived that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocked absorption of about 25 % of the food fat . &quot;
&quot; two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 show the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ oric , fatty diet . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ isation ) was evaluated as follows : as a change of body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as a percentage of the study participants who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months . &quot;
the mean change in the Gesamt@@ chol@@ esterin was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( bas@@ eline 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( starting value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average L@@ DL Cholester@@ ins decreased with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( starting value 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( starting value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the mean change was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting value 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( starting value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ metabol@@ ised or@@ list@@ at were not measurable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
&quot; 7 In general , not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma could only be detected spor@@ adi@@ cally and at extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of cum@@ ulation . &quot;
&quot; in a study involving obes@@ e patients with minimal systemic resor@@ b@@ ation , two main metabol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ zed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after separation of the N @-@ For@@ my@@ l @-@ Leu@@ c@@ ine Group ) were identified , representing approximately 42 % of the total plasma concentration . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not show any particular danger to humans . &quot;

all@@ i is used for weight reduction and is used for overweight adults aged 18 and over with a Body @-@ Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 28 or above . all@@ i should be used in conjunction with a low @-@ fat and low @-@ calorie diet .
BM@@ I helps you determine whether you have a normal weight or overweight in relation to your body size .
&quot; even if these diseases initially do not cause you to feel uncomfortable , you should nevertheless ask your doctor for a check @-@ up . &quot;
&quot; for each 2 kg body weight , which you lose as part of a diet , you can lose an additional kil@@ ogram with the help of all@@ i . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription . &quot;
&quot; C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in is used after organ transplan@@ ts , in severe rheumatoid arthritis and certain severe skin diseases . • War@@ far@@ in or other medicines that have a blood th@@ inning effect . &quot;
oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives and all@@ i • The effect of oral contrac@@ ep@@ tive means for contrac@@ eption ( pill ) may be weakened or lifted when you have strong diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) .
&quot; before taking all@@ i to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist , please contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you : • A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one for the treatment of heart rhythm disorders . &quot;
ask your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take all@@ i and • if you take drugs for high blood pressure as possibly the dosage needs to be adjusted .
&quot; for more information on the blue pages in Section 6 , you can find out how to set your cal@@ ori@@ ental and fat level boundaries . &quot;
&quot; if you om@@ it a meal or contains a meal no fat , do not take a capsule . all@@ i can only work if the food contains fat . &quot;
&quot; if you take the capsule in connection with a meal containing too much fat , you risk food @-@ related accompanying symptoms ( see section 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; to get used to your body in the new eating habits , start before the first capsule collection with a calorie and fat @-@ reduced diet . &quot;
&quot; food di@@ aries are effective , as you can always understand what you eat , how much you eat and it will probably be easier to change your dietary habits . &quot;
&quot; in order to secure your target weight , you should set two daily targets in advance : one for the calories and one for fat . &quot;
eat fatty acids in order to reduce the lik@@ el@@ ihood of diet @-@ related accompanying symptoms ( see section 4 ) . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking the capsules .
remember to ask your doctor beforehand if you are not accustomed to physical activity . • Sta@@ y while taking and also after the ing@@ es@@ tion of all@@ i physically active .
&quot; • If you cannot find any reduction in your weight after 12 weeks of use of all@@ i , please consult your doctor or pharmac@@ ist for advice . &quot;
&quot; under certain circumstances , you have to stop taking all@@ i . • In case of a successful weight loss , it is not about putting your diet in the short term and then returning to the old habits . &quot;
&quot; • If less than one hour has passed since the last meal , take the capsule . • If more than one hour has passed since the last meal , do not take a capsule . &quot;
&quot; flat@@ ul@@ ence with and without oil leaving , sudden or increased bow@@ el strand and soft stool ) are due to the mechanism of action ( see section 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; severe allergic reactions • severe allergic reactions can be found in the following changes : severe short@@ ness of breath , swe@@ ats , skin rash , it@@ ching , swelling in the face , heart rate , circul@@ atory rup@@ ture . &quot;

effects on blood tests It is not known how often these effects occur . • In@@ cre@@ ase specific liver enzymes • affect blood cl@@ ot@@ ting in patients who use war@@ far@@ in or other blood th@@ inning ( anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ulating ) medicines .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the mentioned side effects may neg@@ atively affect you or notice side effects that are not stated in this user information .
&quot; the most common side effects are associated with the effects of the capsules , resulting in increased fat from the body . &quot;
&quot; these side effects usually occur within the first few weeks after the treatment starts , as you may not have consistently reduced the fat percentage in your diet . &quot;
&quot; with the following basic rules you can learn to minim@@ ise nutrition @-@ related accompanying symptoms : • Beg@@ in for a few days , or better a week , before taking capsules with a fat @-@ reduced diet . • Learning about the usual fat content of your favourite foods and about the size of portions that you normally take . &quot;
&quot; if you know exactly how much you eat , chances are that you exceed your fat limit . • Divi@@ de your recommended amount of fat evenly to your daily meals . &quot;
&quot; save the amount of calories and fat that you may consume per meal , not to take it in the form of a gre@@ ase@@ proof main court or a substantial dessert , as you may possibly have done with other programs for weight reduction . &quot;
• Store away from moisture . • Ke@@ ep container tightly closed to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ lic@@ as gel that serve to keep the capsules dry .
do not swallow it in any case . • You can carry your daily dose of all@@ i in the blue transport box ( Shuttle ) that lies with this pack .

obesity has an influence on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases such as : • high blood pressure • diabetes • Heart disease • stroke • Cer@@ tain cancer • Oste@@ o@@ arthritis Please talk to your doctor about your risk for these diseases .
&quot; sustained weight loss , for example by improving diet and more exercise , can prevent serious diseases and have a positive impact on your health . &quot;
&quot; choose meals containing a wide range of nutrients , and gradually learn to eat heal@@ th@@ ily healthy . &quot;
&quot; energy is also measured in kil@@ o@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you can also find in food packaging . • The recommended calorie intake indicates how many calories you should take up to a maximum per day . &quot;
keep in mind the tables below . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with every meal .
&quot; refer to the information below , which indicates the number of calories that is appropriate for you . • Because of the effect of the capsule , compliance with recommended fat intake is crucial . &quot;
&quot; if you take the same amount of fat as before , this may mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat . &quot;
&quot; by adher@@ ing to recommended fat intake , you can maximize the weight loss and at the same time reduce the lik@@ el@@ ihood of diet @-@ related accompanying symptoms . &quot;
&quot; 34 This reduced calorie intake should allow you to gradually lose weight of about 0.5 kg per week , without developing frustr@@ ations and dis@@ appointments . &quot;
&quot; the more active you are , the higher your recommended calorie intake . • &quot; &quot; Low physical activity &quot; &quot; means that you work daily 150 k@@ cal daily , e.g. through 3 km walk , 30 to 45 minute garden work or 2 km running in 15 minutes . &quot;
• For a permanent weight loss it is necessary to set realistic calorie and fat targets and to adhere to them . • Sinn@@ laden is a nutrition journal with information on the calorie and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking all@@ i .
&quot; the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a diet plan and a large number of other information materials , which can help you feed calorie and fat and give guidelines to become more physically active . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a program tailored to your type to support weight loss , this information can help you develop a healthier lifestyle and achieve your target weight . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( like c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as for chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the excessive trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine that can be used as an anti@@ em@@ etic ) .
the application for patients under 18 years is not recommended as there is not enough information about the effects of this age group .
&quot; this means that the substance inhi@@ bits the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies of 1,@@ 8@@ 42 adults who received chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are strong or moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are a powerful trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) . &quot;
81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 from 18@@ 9 ) compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
&quot; compared with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 from 191 patients ) . &quot;
&quot; March 2005 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . a permit for the marketing of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union . &quot;
Alo@@ xi is indicated : for the prevention of acute nausea and vom@@ iting in severely em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy as a result of a cancer and for preventing nausea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to a cancer .
&quot; the efficacy of Alo@@ xi for preventing nausea and vom@@ iting , induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given prior to chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on massage , patients with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ al ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us should be closely monitored after injection . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is required with simultaneous gift of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that pro@@ long the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ T interval is extended or which tend to such an extension . &quot;
&quot; in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi should not be used for prevention or treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting in the days following chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not block the activity of the five chem@@ otherapeu@@ tic agents studied against tumours ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and mit@@ omy@@ cin C ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial , no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction was found between a unique intraven@@ ous dose of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady St@@ ate@@ - concentration of oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population @-@ based pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 In@@ hibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on , C@@ elec@@ oxi@@ b ) and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , Ch@@ ini@@ dine , Ser@@ tr@@ aline and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant effect on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; experience of the use of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies does not occur , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used for pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the treating physician . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies , the most common adverse events were observed in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which were at least possibly associated with Alo@@ xi , headaches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ st@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions taking place ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing reports . &quot;
&quot; in the group with the highest dosage , similar frequencies were seen from adverse events such as in the other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ effective relationships observed . &quot;
&quot; no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were conducted , but due to the large distribution volume , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not an effective therapy for alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , 1,@@ 132 patients receiving a moderate @-@ em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 micro@@ grams of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 micro@@ grams of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide ( half @-@ value of 7.@@ 3 hours ) were given intraven@@ ously in day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one . &quot;
&quot; in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , 6@@ 67 patients who received a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zin as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared with patients receiving 32 mg On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which were given intraven@@ ously in day 1 . &quot;
results of studies with moderate @-@ em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study of strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summari@@ zed in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical studies on the indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval with the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; according to clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and extend the duration of the action potential . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the study carried out in 2@@ 21 healthy subjects was the assessment of the E@@ KG @-@ effects of intraven@@ ous Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg . &quot;
&quot; resor@@ ption After IV administration , an initial decrease of plasma concentrations follows a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half @-@ time of about 40 hours . &quot;
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area below the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dose @-@ proportional in the overall dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg in healthy patients and cancer patients .
&quot; following IV administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean ( ± SD ) increase in the pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day 5 . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations suggest that at once daily intraven@@ ous dosage of 0.@@ 25 mg pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to the value measured after a one @-@ time IV administration of 0.@@ 75 mg ; however the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after the one @-@ time rating of 0.@@ 75 mg .
&quot; approximately 40 % are eliminated through the kidneys , and about another 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , which have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies on metabol@@ isation , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in a lesser degree , the I@@ so@@ enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; elimination After an intraven@@ ous dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ changeable substance made about 40 % of the given dosage . &quot;
&quot; after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous captive bolt injection , the total body was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and ren@@ al clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; although patients with severe liver function disorder increase the terminal elimination of elim@@ inations and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , however , a reduction in the dose is not justified . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ clinical studies effects were observed only after expos@@ ures , which are considered adequate above the maximum human therapeutic exposure , which indicates a low relevance for clinical use . &quot;
&quot; 10 out of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , indications of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only be blocked in very high concentrations of ion channels , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and can extend the action potential . &quot;
&quot; high doses of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded to 30 @-@ times the therapeutic exposure in humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to an increased frequency of liver tumours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid gland , p@@ itu@@ itary gland , pancre@@ as , epi@@ der@@ mis ) and skin tumours in rats , but not in mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dosage and since Alo@@ xi is determined by humans for a unique application , the relevance of these results is low as for humans . &quot;

&quot; in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report in which the allocation of approval for the marketing of the medicines intended for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Al@@ ph@@ el@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution . &quot;
&quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ el@@ eon should resemble a biological medicine called ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same practitioner , which is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; reference resin agents &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( liver disease induced by virus infection ) .
&quot; in a micro@@ scopic examination , the liver tissue damages damages , and the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ ine Amin@@ otran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) in the blood standard have been increased . &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a yeast produced by a gene ( DNA ) , which stimulates the metabolism of the active substance . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ e@@ eon submitted data demonstrating the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ e@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( substance structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of action , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study of hepatitis C patients , the efficacy of al@@ ph@@ el@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference resin to 4@@ 55 patients . &quot;
the study measured how many patients responded to the drug after 12 of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after treatment ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non business purposes only from the E@@ MEA is acknowledged What were the greatest concerns that prompted the CH@@ MP to prohi@@ bit the marketing ?
&quot; furthermore , concerns were expressed that the data for the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed do not suff@@ ice . &quot;
the number of hepatitis C patients who responded to treatment with Al@@ ph@@ el@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in the clinical trial .
&quot; after setting the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ e@@ eon , the disease rose again in more patients than with the reference resin ; in addition , Al@@ ph@@ el@@ eon had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from this , the test conducted in the study was not sufficiently vali@@ dated to determine the extent to which the drug acts as an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) . &quot;
&quot; it can be used to treat Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection associated with crust formation ) and small infected spaw@@ ns ( crack or cuts ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have been demon@@ stra@@ bly or presumably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because al@@ arms may not act against this type of infection .
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go may be used in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years , the skin area to be treated may not exceed 2 % of the body &apos;s surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by blocking bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bit the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was dis@@ kl@@ ed after the end of the treatment .
&quot; 119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2,@@ 1 % ) of 71 patients under placebo responded to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of infected skin findings , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together in Hau@@ tw@@ unden , approximately 90 % of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; however , in these two studies , Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough in treating ab@@ sc@@ esses ( egg @-@ filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or from infections caused by MR@@ SA . &quot;
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is an irritation at the job site .
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go in short @-@ term treatment of the following superficial skin infections were out@@ weighed against the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected little La@@ zer@@ ations , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
&quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . a permit for the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go across the European Union . &quot;
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in case of sensi@@ tization or severe local irritation by the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment , treatment is canc@@ eled , the o@@ int@@ ment is carefully wi@@ ped out and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection is started . &quot;
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not intended to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as patho@@ gen or suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of retin@@ am@@ ic@@ in in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient .
alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or deterioration of the infected area occurs after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment .
the effect of simultaneous use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in and other topical remedies on the same skin area has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended .
&quot; due to the low plasma concentrations that have been achieved in humans after topical application on sk@@ imm@@ ed skin or infected superficial wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not to be expected ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 After a simultaneous oral administration of 2 times a day , 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the mean retin@@ am@@ ic@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x after topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment on de@@ ported skin of healthy adult men by 81 % . &quot;
due to the low systemic exposure to topical application dose adjustment is not required if topical re@@ ap@@ am@@ ic@@ ulin is applied during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral consumption and are inadequate with regard to a statement on effects on the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
&quot; Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment should only be applied during pregnancy , when a topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of retin@@ am@@ ic@@ in is prefer@@ able to the application of a systemic antibiotic . &quot;
deciding whether breast@@ feeding should continue / stop or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued / stopped is to weigh between the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the infant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
&quot; in clinical studies of 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections , which have applied to Al@@ tar@@ go , the most commonly reported adverse effect was irritation on the date of the administration that concerned about 1 % of patients . &quot;
&quot; the mode of operation Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance which is isolated by fermentation from C@@ lit@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) . &quot;
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin &apos;s action mechanism is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction on a specific binding site of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome that differs from binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the binding site ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 is involved and lies in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase center .
&quot; through binding on this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits the pe@@ p@@ tide transfer , block partial P @-@ binding interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units . &quot;
&quot; due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance to the use of retin@@ am@@ ic@@ in at least some infection forms , a consultation should be sought by experts . &quot;
&quot; there were no differences in the in vitro activity of retin@@ am@@ ic@@ in opposite S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in case of failure to treat S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of strains with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered . &quot;
&quot; resor@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment was applied daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion to intact and pe@@ ened skin for up to 7 days . &quot;
&quot; of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained . &quot;
the sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and in the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
&quot; however , the maximum individual systemic inclusion in humans after topical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment on 200 c@@ m2 of sk@@ imm@@ ed skin ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 ng · h / ml ) was 6@@ 60 times lower than the retina in@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP suspension . &quot;
&quot; metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of retin@@ am@@ ic@@ in in human liver micro@@ som@@ ites was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with low participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in studies on oral toxic@@ ity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid changes . &quot;
in @-@ vitro examination on gene mutation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse lymph@@ oma test respectively in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes and in rats micro@@ kernel test for in @-@ vi@@ vo investigation of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
&quot; there was neither male nor female rats showing signs of reduced fertility in oral doses of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , whereby up to 5 times higher exposure was achieved than the highest estimated exposure to people ( topical application on 200 c@@ m2 of sk@@ id skin ) : &quot;
&quot; in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study of rats , at oral doses of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to ≥ 3 @-@ times the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , develop@@ mental toxic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of fet@@ us and delayed oscill@@ ation ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity have been established . &quot;
&quot; the owner of the marketing authorization must ensure that a pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system , as presented in module 1.@@ 8.1 of the marketing application ( version 6.@@ 2 ) is present and works before the product is marketed and as long as the marketed product is applied . &quot;
&quot; the owner of the marketing authorization is obliged to conduct detailed studies and additional pharmaceutical co@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance activities in the Pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance Plan , as described in version 1 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) , as well as all additional updates of the R@@ MP , which are agreed with the CH@@ MP . &quot;
&quot; as described in the CH@@ MP &quot; Guid@@ eline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal use , &quot; the updated R@@ MP should be submitted at the same time with the next Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report . &quot;
irritation or other signs and symptoms in the treated area show you should stop the use of Al@@ tar@@ go and talk to your doctor .
&quot; do not use any other o@@ int@@ ments , cre@@ ams or l@@ oti@@ ons on the surface treated with Al@@ tar@@ go unless prescribed by your doctor . &quot;
&quot; it must not be applied in the eyes , on the mouth or on the lips , in the nose or in the female genital area . &quot;
&quot; if the o@@ int@@ ment is out of sight on one of these surfaces , wash the place with water and ask your doctor for advice if discomfort occurs . &quot;
&quot; after applying the o@@ int@@ ment , you can cover the affected area with a sterile association or a ga@@ zelle tape unless your doctor has advised you not to cover the surface . &quot;
&quot; it is offered in an aluminium tube with a plastic zip containing 5 , 10 or 15 grams of o@@ int@@ ment , or in an aluminium pou@@ ch containing 0.5 g of o@@ int@@ ment . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between 1 and 15 years who are not immune to these two diseases .
&quot; Ambi@@ rix is used as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses , whereby protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used when there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during imm@@ uni@@ zation and it is ensured that the vacc@@ ination plan can be brought to an end in two doses . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her dose is required against hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or another hepatitis A or B vaccine can be given . &quot;
&quot; vacc@@ ines work by contributing to the immune system ( the natural def@@ ences of the body ) , as it can fight against a disease . &quot;
&quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system detects the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; foreign &quot; and produces antibodies against it . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same constitu@@ ents as the vaccine Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ul@@ ts approved since 1996 and the vacc@@ inated vaccine Twin@@ rix children since 1997 .
&quot; the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ul@@ ts and Twin@@ at@@ rix children are administered as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of three doses . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ Peak award adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data supporting the application of Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ul@@ ts were also used as a cover for the application of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection .
&quot; in an additional study of 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six month and a 12 month gap between the two inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; in between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children , Ambi@@ rix initiated a month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B . &quot;
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix was similar to a six @-@ month gap between the inj@@ ections .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , lack of appetite , pain on the injection site , redness , fatigue and irrit@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other ingredients or ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) . &quot;
&quot; August 2002 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals for the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals . &quot;
&quot; the standardi@@ zation plan for pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ zing with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , whereby the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her treatment for hepatitis A and hepatitis B is desired , vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or combination vaccine . &quot;
the anti @-@ Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ Hepatitis A Virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) antibody levels observed in the same order as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
&quot; it is not yet fully assured whether immun@@ ological persons who have addressed hepatitis A vacc@@ ination may require a refres@@ her treatment as protection , since they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory in no longer det@@ ectable antibodies . &quot;
&quot; 3 As with all injection vacc@@ ines , for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the gift of the vaccine appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately . &quot;
&quot; if a faster protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme with the combination vaccine is recommended that contains 360 ELISA units form@@ alin @-@ in@@ activated Hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and people with disorders of the immune system , there may be no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody , which may be necessary in these cases . &quot;
&quot; as an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or intra@@ muscular administration of the glut@@ eal muscle could result in a sub@@ optimal result , these inj@@ ections should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; in case of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous as an exception , as it may occur in these cases after intra@@ muscular administration of hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges . &quot;
&quot; when Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year of life with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ el , in@@ activated poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis and Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us @-@ influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects , it is necessary to assume that there is no adequate immune response . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study conducted with 3 vacc@@ ines of this formulation in adults , the incidence of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ur@@ ation , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headache and fever was comparable to the frequency that was observed in the earlier thi@@ omer@@ ase and preserv@@ ative @-@ containing vaccine formulation . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines were administered to 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to 15 years . &quot;
&quot; in a study of 300 participants at the age of 12 to 15 years , Ambi@@ rix toler@@ ability was compared with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and sever@@ ity on a basis of calculation per injection dose Ambi@@ rix , but not on a basis for calculation per person . &quot;
&quot; pain was observed after the administration of Ambi@@ rix at 50@@ ,@@ 7 % of the subjects compared to 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in the subjects following the administration of a dose of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; according to the complete vacc@@ ination cycle 6@@ 6,@@ 4 % of the subjects administered by Ambi@@ rix reported pain , versus 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % in the test subjects , which had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; however , the frequency of sever@@ ity was comparable to a pro@@ band ( i.e. about the total vacc@@ ination cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the subjects who got Ambi@@ rix , compared with 3@@ 6.2 % in the subjects receiving the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) . &quot;
the frequency of pronounced pain and sever@@ ity was low and comparable to that observed after the combination of the combination vaccine was observed using the 3 @-@ dose vaccine scheme .
&quot; in a comparative study of 1 to 11 year old vacc@@ ines , the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ gruppe was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ alin @-@ infected hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in the 6@@ - to 11 year old , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix was reported a more frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection site ) per dose , not per pro@@ band . &quot;
the proportion of vacc@@ inations that reported severe side @-@ effects during the 2 @-@ dose vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ dose vaccine using the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of form@@ alin @-@ infected hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different .
&quot; in clinical trials conducted at vacc@@ ines ranging from 1 to 15 years , serum conversion rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % were a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
serum conversion rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
&quot; 7 In a comparative study conducted in 12@@ - and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 were given the standard combin@@ ation@@ ary vaccine with three doses . &quot;
&quot; in the 28@@ 9 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was worth@@ less , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 were significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix in the month 2 and 6 . &quot;
&quot; the immun@@ ological answers , which were reached in a clinical comparative study at 1 @-@ 11 @-@ year @-@ old one month after completion of the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose vaccine with a combination vaccine containing 360 ELISA units of form@@ alin @-@ infected hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be demonstrated for at least 24 months after the immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months immun@@ isation scheme .
the immune response observed in this study was comparable to that observed after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ alin @-@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
&quot; in a clinical trial involving 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies is comparable to 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vaccine scheme . &quot;
&quot; if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix was administered at the same time with the fresh@@ ening of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ el , in@@ activated poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with the first dose of a combined m@@ umps @-@ m@@ umps vaccine , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens . &quot;
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ect@@ ants and ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sions as for the earlier formulation .
the vaccine is to be examined both before and after the res@@ us@@ p@@ ation of any foreign particles and / or physical visible changes .

&quot; hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by fer@@ mented foods and drinks , but can also be transmitted through other ways , such as bathing in water contaminated by water . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary . &quot;
&quot; as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not fully protect against infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vacc@@ ination series has been completed with 2 doses . &quot;
if you / your child is already infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus prior to the administration of both vacc@@ ines Ambi@@ rix ( although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill at the time of the vacc@@ ination point ) a vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
&quot; protection against other infections , which may damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those after hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection , cannot be medi@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; • If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any component of this vaccine , including ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) . &quot;
&quot; an allergic reaction can be expressed by it@@ ching skin failures , breathing difficulties or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B , if you / your child has a severe infection with fever . &quot;
&quot; • If you quickly want to have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. , within 6 months and before the usually scheduled administration of the second vacc@@ ination dose ) . &quot;
&quot; at a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
instead it will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced salary of effective constitu@@ ents per vacc@@ ination dose ( 360 ELISA units of an in@@ filtr@@ ated hepatitis B virus and 10 micro@@ grams of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface treatment ) .
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective components is usually administered one month after the first dose and will give you / your child a vacc@@ ination protection against the end of the vacc@@ ination series .
&quot; sometimes Ambi@@ rix is spra@@ yed in people who suffer from severe blood cl@@ ots , under the skin and not into the muscle . • If you / your child is weakened by a disease or treatment in your / its own immune system , or if you / your child is undergoing a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of those individuals on vacc@@ ination may not be sufficient so that a blood test can be required to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is . &quot;
21 Tell your doctor if you / your child is taking further medicine ( including those you can get without prescription ) or if you have been vacc@@ inated or imm@@ ung@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) have been given / has been planned or is planned in the near future .
&quot; however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses . &quot;
&quot; if another vaccine has to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated at separate places and as many extre@@ mi@@ ties as possible . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nevertheless be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; usually , Ambi@@ rix will not be given pregnant or nursing women unless it is urgent that they will be vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B. &quot;
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix please inform your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
&quot; if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible . &quot;
how often ( more than 1 case per 10 dec@@ im@@ ated doses ) : • P@@ ain or discomfort at the inser@@ tion point or redness • Mat@@ ure • irrit@@ ability • headache • lack of appetite
how often ( up to 1 case per 10 dec@@ im@@ ated doses ) : • swelling at the injection site • fever ( above 38 ° C )
&quot; other side effects reported for days or weeks following vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B are very rare ( less than 1 case per 10,000 mixed doses ) are : &quot;
&quot; these include locally limited or extended r@@ ashes that can itch or blow @-@ shaped , swelling of the eyes and face , frigh@@ tening breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden drop of blood pressure and un@@ consciousness . &quot;
&quot; flu @-@ like symptoms , including ch@@ ills , muscle and joint pain var@@ ic@@ ose attacks , di@@ zz@@ iness , ab@@ norm@@ alities such as ting@@ ling and &quot; ant running , &quot; Multiple sclerosis , disorders of the optic nerve , severe headaches and stiff@@ ness of the neck , dis@@ ruption of normal brain functions &quot;

notify your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the mentioned side effects you / your child significantly affects or notice side effects that are not stated in this package .
Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; on the basis of the data , which have been known since the distribution of the first authorization for the placing on the market , the CH@@ MP assumed that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive . &quot;
&quot; however , since Ambi@@ rix was brought into circulation only in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug is limited due to the low patient exposure . &quot;
am@@ mon@@ t@@ aps can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with incomplete enzyme defect or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ia @-@ mic en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage caused by high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ asti@@ a - split by several single doses to meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed under food or administered via a gastro@@ stom@@ y hose ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading hose ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach of leading hose ) . &quot;
&quot; this was not a comparative study , as am@@ mon@@ ites could not be compared with another treatment or placebo ( a placebo , i.e. without active ingredient ) . &quot;
&quot; can also lead to loss of appetite , abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fa@@ inting , fluid retention , stomach pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that am@@ mon@@ t@@ aps in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevented high ammon@@ ia levels .
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ asti@@ a was approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; because the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of approval was limited to this medicine . &quot;
the use is indicated in all patients with a complete enzyme shortage already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
&quot; in patients with a delayed manifest form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first month of life ) , there is an indication for use when hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy exists in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; for infants , for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form . &quot;
&quot; the daily dose is calculated individually , taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake of the patient . &quot;
&quot; according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight of over 20 kg , as well as for adolescents and adults . &quot;
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required in patients who suffer from an early manifest deficiency of carb@@ oni@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine trans@@ ac@@ o@@ carb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e .
ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day is required .
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be administered to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , as there is a risk of the emergence of o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach . &quot;
&quot; each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used only with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , as well as with low sodium retention and ede@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat liver and kidneys are done , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure . &quot;
the importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known ; therefore the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; in sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , there was a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal multip@@ lication and increased loss of neur@@ ons . &quot;
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ished number of functioning nerve end@@ ings in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
&quot; it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in the breast milk in humans , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during lac@@ tation period ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , at least 56 % of patients had at least one adverse event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS . &quot;
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ectal patient who developed a metabolic En@@ cephal@@ opathy in conjunction with lac@@ tate @-@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of over@@ dose occurred in a 5 month old infant with an accidental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go hand in hand with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate which showed dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in intraven@@ ous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active compound that is con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine which is ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kidneys .
&quot; thus , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable with ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ ting excess nitrogen . &quot;
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can be produced for each gram of 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
&quot; it is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is started immediately , in order to improve survival chances and clinical outcome . &quot;
the pre@@ diction of the early manifest form of the disease by occurrence of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ anti@@ st and the disease itself led to death in the treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analo@@ gues within the first year of their life .
&quot; by ha@@ em@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative ways of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born babies at post part@@ al ( however , within the first months of life ) to 80 % . &quot;
&quot; patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and who were treated before the first occurrence of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it occurred with many to mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its . &quot;
patients with a late manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of the or@@ ni@@ thine trans@@ ac@@ o@@ carb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) which were treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and a protein @-@ reduced diet were the survival rate of 98 % .
existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible even in the case of treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated in liver and kidneys enzy@@ mati@@ cally with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine . &quot;
&quot; the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined after an individual dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , in so@@ ber healthy adults and with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis , as well as repeated doses of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled trials ) . &quot;
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients following IV administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in tablet form 15 minutes after taking measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were detected .
&quot; in the majority of patients with ure@@ a @-@ cycli@@ c disorders or ha@@ em@@ o@@ glo@@ bin@@ opath@@ ies , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day to 20 g / day ) was not det@@ ectable in plasma the following morning after noc@@ tur@@ nal fasting . &quot;
&quot; in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the liver , which were repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in plasma levels were five times higher than after the first gifts . &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to about 80 @-@ 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
&quot; according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat was not treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( examination 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) . &quot;
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules are either taken or@@ ally ( infants and children who do not yet swallow tablets or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or via Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch or a nas@@ al probe .
&quot; according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in infants , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight of over 20 kg , as well as for adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in plasma should be kept within the normal range . &quot;
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required in patients who suffer from an early manifest deficiency of carb@@ oni@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine trans@@ ac@@ o@@ carb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e .
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5.@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; when rat f@@ utes were exposed before the birth phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , lesi@@ ons occurred in the pyramid cells of the brain bark . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ectal patient who developed a metabolic En@@ cephal@@ opathy in conjunction with lac@@ tate @-@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
&quot; thus , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable with ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ ting excess fat . &quot;
based on studies on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
&quot; existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible even in the case of treatment , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur . &quot;
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in gran@@ ule form 15 minutes after taking measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were detected .
&quot; during durability , the patient can keep the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; in this procedure the small measuring spoon contains 0,@@ 95 g , the mean measuring spoon 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has to receive the medicine above a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat amounts to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing so that they can not ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accumulate in the body after eating proteins . &quot;
&quot; if laboratory tests are carried out , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can influence the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription . &quot;
&quot; during breast@@ feeding , you may not use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS as the medicine may pass into the breast milk and damage your baby . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases confusion , headaches , taste disturbances , post@@ age of hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory disorders and worsen@@ ing of existing neuro@@ logical conditions were observed . &quot;
&quot; if you notice any of these symptoms , immediately contact your doctor or the emergency room of your hospital for the purpose of an appropriate treatment . &quot;
if you forgot to take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .
&quot; changes in the blood image ( red blood cells , white blood cells , plat@@ el@@ ets ) , decreased appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , impotence , fluid retention ( swelling ) , skin rash , kidney dysfunction , weight gain and abnormal laboratory values . &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the mentioned side effects may neg@@ atively affect you or notice side effects that are not stated in this user information .
you may not use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS after the exp@@ iry date specified on the um@@ bili@@ cal box and the container after the exp@@ iry date specified .
&quot; as AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS looks and contents of the package AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets are of whi@@ tish colour and oval form , and they are provided with the embos@@ sing &quot; U@@ C@@ Y 500 . &quot; &quot;
&quot; 30 If laboratory tests are carried out , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can influence the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription . &quot;
&quot; you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS in the same single doses or via a stomach fi@@ stel ( hose , which runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nas@@ al probe ( hose , which is led through the nose into the stomach ) . &quot;
31 • Take a he@@ aped measuring spoon of gran@@ ulate from the container . • Cut a straight edge , e.g. a knife edge over the top of the knife spoon to remove excess gran@@ ules . • Take the recommended number of measuring spo@@ ons gran@@ ules from the container . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example with unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the thor@@ ax with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; &quot; stress &quot; &quot; ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measure of electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) . &quot;
&quot; if angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who undergo a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can help in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of AC@@ S , in which the effect of angi@@ ox in sole administration or in conjunction with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another medicine for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) was compared with the conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI . &quot;
&quot; during the PCI , patients often used a st@@ ent ( a short tube left in the ar@@ tery to prevent closure ) and they also received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots such as Ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of AC@@ S , angi@@ ox - with or without the administration of G@@ PI - was as effective in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients undergoing PCI , Angi@@ ox was as effective as he@@ par@@ in in terms of all indicators except for severe bleeding which was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din , other hi@@ ru@@ dine or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used in patients who recently had a hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge , as well as in people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart infection . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Angi@@ ox is an acceptable substitute for He@@ par@@ in during the treatment of AC@@ S and during a PCI .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd . &quot;
for the treatment of adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( unstable Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST mid@@ range inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in case of emergency intervention or early intervention .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with AC@@ S is an intraven@@ ous resolution of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if a PCI is performed in another sequence , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; according to the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be resum@@ ed for 4 to 12 hours after clinical needs . &quot;
&quot; immediately before the procedure a bolt of 0,5 mg / kg should be given , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention . &quot;
the recommended dose of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and a subsequent intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention .
&quot; the safety and efficacy of a common bol@@ us administration of angi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended , even if a short PCI intervention is planned . &quot;
&quot; if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to under 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicinal product should be carefully mixed before use and the bol@@ us dose can be administered intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered properly . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney function restriction ( GF@@ R 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( whether treated with bi@@ vali@@ ant against AC@@ S or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used . &quot;
&quot; if the ACT value is below 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose should be checked again . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney damage , which were included in the Phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which resulted in approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the application of the Bi@@ vali@@ ant @-@ Bol@@ us with an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
&quot; 3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients , angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
the treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the intraven@@ ous administration of un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low @-@ molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• serious hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any other component or against hi@@ ru@@ dine • active bleeding or increased risk of bleeding due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of the hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis system and / or ir@@ reversible bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in di@@ aly@@ sis patients
&quot; during treatment , patients are carefully monitored with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially if bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; even if the majority of the arter@@ ial points occur in PCI patients under bi@@ vali@@ ant , patients who undergo an abnormal coron@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) may suffer from bleeding during the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are taking War@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ vali@@ ant , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after setting the treatment with bi@@ vali@@ ant again reaches the level before treatment . &quot;
&quot; based on the knowledge about the mechanism of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggregate ) it can be assumed that these active substances increase the risk of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in the combination of bi@@ vali@@ ant with plat@@ el@@ ets or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis parameters are checked regularly . &quot;
&quot; animal experimental studies are insufficient in terms of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , un@@ binding or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ vali@@ ant alone ; 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ vali@@ ant plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hibit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ised to either un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
&quot; both in the Bi@@ vali@@ ant Group and in the comparative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years of age were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
severe bleeding was defined according to the AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for heavy bleeding like in table 2 .
both light and heavy bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in groups with he@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
&quot; an AC@@ U@@ ITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ ocular , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge or hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge in the point of point , reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in level ≥ 3 g / dl with well @-@ known hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge , re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; further , less frequently observed hem@@ loc@@ cul@@ ar@@ isations , which occurred with more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; points of point , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or throat . &quot;
the following information about side effects is based on data from a clinical trial involving bi@@ vali@@ ant in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI .
&quot; both in the Bi@@ vali@@ ant group and in the comparative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years of age were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
both light and heavy bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
&quot; the following side effects , which are not listed above , have been reported in practice after a comprehensive application and are group@@ ed according to system bodies in table 6 . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the treatment with Bi@@ vali@@ ant is immediately to be abor@@ ted and the patient is closely mes@@ hed with regard to signs of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox contains bi@@ vali@@ ant , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bo@@ inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both the cataly@@ tic center and the ani@@ on binding region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or in t@@ innitus . &quot;
&quot; the binding of bi@@ vali@@ ant to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and hence its effect , is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in slowly spl@@ its the bond between Bi@@ vali@@ ant @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , which re@@ generates the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in . &quot;

&quot; in healthy subjects and in patients , Bi@@ vali@@ ant shows a dose @-@ dependent anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is evi@@ den@@ ced by the pro@@ long@@ ation of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT . &quot;
&quot; if a PCI was performed in the patients below , an additional bol@@ us of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1,@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h . &quot;
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study un@@ question@@ able he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for treatment of acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S ) in patients with unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST up@@ market inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children aged six years with diabetes who need insulin treatment . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh or upper arm inj@@ ected or administered as a permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump . &quot;
&quot; diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels ( sugar ) in the blood , or that insulin can not be processed effectively . &quot;
insulin secre@@ tion differs very slightly from the insulin and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter duration than a short @-@ acting human insulin .
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1,@@ 5@@ 49 adults and in a study of 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years . &quot;
&quot; in type 2 diabetes , in which the body cannot work effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in a study of 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
&quot; in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes , a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was determined after six months compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin lap@@ ses . &quot;
&quot; in adults with type 2 diabetes , the reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin , or any of the other ingredients , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH a permit for the placing of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra can be used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh or the delta muscle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous through continuous in@@ fusion in the area of the abdominal area . &quot;
&quot; due to reduced glucose levels and reduced insulin metabolism , insulin needs in patients with a reduction in liver function can be reduced . &quot;
&quot; the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the method of production may result in a change in insulin requirements . &quot;
&quot; 3 A inadequate dose or termination of treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , may lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life threatening . &quot;
switching a patient to another type of insulin or insulin in another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may make a change in dosage required .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the effective profile of the insulin used and can therefore change when changing the treatment plan .
&quot; the substances that can increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase the tendency to hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia are oral anti@@ diabe@@ tics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ con@@ ver@@ ting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ y@@ ll@@ in , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ine , S@@ aliz@@ yl@@ ate and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the symptoms of the adren@@ ergi@@ c counter @-@ regulation can be weakened or missing under the effect of sympath@@ iz@@ ers such as beta block@@ ers , c@@ lon@@ i@@ din , gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ dine and reserves . &quot;
&quot; animal experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity did not show any differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine and human insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether insulin secre@@ tion occurs in human breast milk , but in general insulin is not absorbed in breast milk , nor is it resor@@ bed to oral application . &quot;
&quot; the following are listed from clinical studies , listed according to system bodies and sorted by decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 100 ; often not estimated based on available data ) . &quot;
&quot; cold wel@@ ds , cool and pale skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , anxiety , unusual exhaus@@ tion or weakness , anxiety , unusual exhaus@@ tion or weakness , confusion , drow@@ sin@@ ess , drow@@ sin@@ ess , headache , nausea and pal@@ pit@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy U@@ ses to continuously change the injection unit within the injection area , may result in a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy at the injection site . &quot;
severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia with un@@ consciousness can be treated by an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) administered by a correspon@@ dingly trained person or by intraven@@ ous glucose by a doctor .
&quot; after a glu@@ co@@ ag@@ onal injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and avoid similar episodes . &quot;
insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake ( especially through skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - be insulin secre@@ tions occur more quickly and the active duration is shorter than with cou@@ - man@@ em normal insulin .
&quot; in a study with 18 male persons aged between 21 and 50 years with type 1 diabetes mel@@ li@@ - tus , insulin secre@@ tion in the therapeutic relevant dosage range from 0,@@ 0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg showed a dispro@@ portion@@ ate glu@@ cos@@ al effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a dispro@@ portion@@ ate increase in the glu@@ cos@@ al effect , just like human insulin . &quot;
insulin secre@@ tion has twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the full glu@@ cos@@ al effect about 2 hours earlier than a human insulin .
&quot; from the data it was obvious that in an application of insulin ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal , comparable post @-@ pran@@ dial gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , as with a human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; when insulin was served in 2 minutes before the meal , a better post @-@ pran@@ dial control was achieved than with a normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; if insulin is applied in 15 minutes after the meal begins , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , as with a human normal insulin , which is given 2 mi@@ ths before the meal ( see Fig@@ ure 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; insulin dosage in gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the beginning of the meal was given before the beginning of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1A ) and compared to a normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ B ) . &quot;
insulin dosage in gift 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the start of the meal in comparison to human Nor@@ mal mal@@ ine that was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the start of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ C ) .
