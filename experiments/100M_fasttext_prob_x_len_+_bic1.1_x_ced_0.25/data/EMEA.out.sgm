<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) has assessed the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the application of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">"if you need more information about your illness or treatment, please read the package leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist."</seg>
<seg id="3">"if you would like further information on the basis of the recommendations of the CHMP, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR)."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is available as a 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg tablets, 10 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg of processed tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution for intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml)."</seg>
<seg id="5">"B. wirls thinking and speaking, hallucinations (listening or seeing things that are not present), distrust and delusions; • Bipolar-I-disorder, a psychic disorder where patients alternate manic episodes (periods of abnormal mood) alternating with periods of normal mood."</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and for the prevention of manic episodes in patients who have addressed the drug in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for fast control of increased unrest or behavioural disorders when the oral intake of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both diseases, the solution can be used for inserting or the melting tablets for patients who have difficulty swallowing tablets."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time, which are broken down as well as Abilify, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this impairs the signal transmission between brain cells through" "neurotransmitters", "i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of nerve cells to each other."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole is probably mainly known as a "partial agony" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripiprazole as 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in a lesser degree than the neurotransmitter works to activate the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"as dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, thereby reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing their recurrence."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the efficacy of Abilify, which prevents recurrence of symptoms, was studied in three studies of up to one year."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases that suffered from increased unrest, over a period of two hours with a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study Abilify was compared to 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence, to 160 patients in which the manic symptoms were already stabilized with Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder that suffered from increased unrest with that of Lorazepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies, the change in the symptoms of patients was examined using a standard dial for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absorbs the enamel tablets and the solution for absorbing (recording).</seg>
<seg id="20">"in both studies with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg received significantly greater anxiety than the patients receiving placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in the application for the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify was more effective than placebo in four of the five short-term studies of manic symptoms."</seg>
<seg id="22">"moreover, up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo, Abilify prevented the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and when administered in addition to an existing treatment."</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15 mg doses were also more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased unrest and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of Abilify (observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (drowsiness), drowsiness (drowsiness), drowsiness (drowsiness), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the advantages of Abilify in treating schizophrenia and moderate to severe manic episodes in patients with predominantly manic episodes, and in which the manic episodes discussed the treatment with Aripiprazole compared to the risks."</seg>
<seg id="26">"furthermore, the Committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of injection solution in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disturbance, if oral therapy is not appropriate, compared to the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in June 2004, the European Commission granted approval to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a permit for the placing of Abilify in the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients with predominantly manic episodes and their manic episodes related to treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at an maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once a day regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">"increased efficacy in doses above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once a day, independent of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="32">Efficacy of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">"with regard to the greater sensitivity of these patients, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">"if the CYP3A4 induction is removed from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic disorders and affective disorders, and was reported in some cases after onset or after a change of antipsychotic therapy, also in case of treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that there was no increased risk of suicide using Aripiprazole versus other antipsychotics in patients with bipolar disorder.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including accelerized and malignant form)."</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Late dyskinesia: in clinical trials which lasted a year or less there were occasional reports about during treatment with Aripiprazole occuring dyskinesia.</seg>
<seg id="39">"if symptoms and symptoms of a late dyskinesia occur with Abilify, should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a MNS or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be removed."</seg>
<seg id="41">"therefore, Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or in cases related to seizures."</seg>
<seg id="42">"(56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazole in patients with psychoses associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazole had an increased risk of dying compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="43">"however, there were in one of these studies, a study of fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for undesirable cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripiprazole."</seg>
<seg id="44">"hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical anti-psychotic agents, including Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycemia-related adverse events associated with Abilify and other atypical anti-psychotic agents who allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">"polydipses, polyurie, polyphagy and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should regularly be monitored with regard to deterioration of glucose levels."</seg>
<seg id="47">"weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications."</seg>
<seg id="48">"due to the primary effect of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is required when Aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with overlying side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the H2 antagonist family, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is not considered clinically relevant."</seg>
<seg id="50">"in a clinical study with healthy subjects, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC of Aripiprazole by 107% while the CMAx remained unchanged."</seg>
<seg id="51">"it is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as Fluoxetine and Paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar doses should be made."</seg>
<seg id="52">"with CYP2D6 'bad' (=" poor ") metabolisers, the joint application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers."</seg>
<seg id="53">Considering the common gift of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify the potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">"other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV proteinase inhibitors, may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made."</seg>
<seg id="55">"after replacing the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of Abilify should be increased to the dose level prior to the onset of the accompanying therapy."</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 are administered together with Abilify can be expected with a moderate rise in Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">"in clinical trials doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazole showed no significant effect on the metabolites of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextrometamorphan / 3 method xymorphine ratio), 2C19 (Omeprzol) and 3A4 (Dextrometamorphan)."</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">This drug may not be used in pregnancy due to the insufficient data base for safety in humans and due to the concerns generated in reproductive studies during animal studies unless the potential benefits clearly justify the potential risk of the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">"however, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned of serving dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazole has no negative influence on them."</seg>
<seg id="61">The following adverse events were more common (≥ 1 / 100) compared to placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">"the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: common (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100)."</seg>
<seg id="63">"schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study over 52 weeks, patients treated with Aripiprazole showed a total lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystonia and Dyskinesia compared to patients treated with haloperidol (57.3%)."</seg>
<seg id="64">"in a placebo-controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients with Aripiprazole treatment and 13.1% in patients with placebo."</seg>
<seg id="65">"in another controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% was 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazole and 15.1% in patients with opiprazole."</seg>
<seg id="66">"in a controlled study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23,5% in patients with Aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients with haloperidol treatment."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in another study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients with Aripiprazole treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment."</seg>
<seg id="68">"in the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo."</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo in which potentially clinically significant changes of routinely controlled laboratory parameters did not reveal any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">"increases of CPK (creatine phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo."</seg>
<seg id="71">"side effects reported in connection with an anti-psychotic therapy, and their occurrence as reported in the treatment with Aripiprazole include malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and varicose attacks, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="72">"in clinical studies and since the market launch, unintended or deliberate acute overdosages with Aripiprazole alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death."</seg>
<seg id="73">"although there is no information on the efficacy of a hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazole, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is beneficial in the treatment of overdose because Aripiprazole has a high plasma level binding."</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder is mediated via the combination of a partial-agonistic effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">"in vitro, Aripiprazole showed a high affinity to the dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and a moderate affinity to the dopamine D4-, for serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, for alpha-1-adrenergic and histamine-H1receptor."</seg>
<seg id="76">"with Aripiprazole in dosages ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks to healthy subjects, the positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction of the binding of 11C racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, at the Nucleus caudatus and on the putfile."</seg>
<seg id="77">"in three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) of 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="78">In a haloperidol-controlled trial in week 52 the proportion of responder patients receiving a response to the study medication was similar in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">"current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study targets, including PANSS and Montgomery-Asberg- depression rates, showed significantly greater improvement than in haloperidol."</seg>
<seg id="80">"in a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks on stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazole was significantly reduced in the rate of relapse, which was 34% in the Aripiprazole group and 57% under placebo."</seg>
<seg id="81">"in an opium-controlled, multinational double-blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study target 'weight gain' was, less patients experienced a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca.)."</seg>
<seg id="82">"in two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazole showed a efficacy against placebo over 3 weeks compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy trial more than 3 weeks with a fixed dose with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder Aripiprazole versus placebo did not show superior efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="84">"in two placebo and active-controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features, Aripiprazole showed a efficacy compared to placebo in week 3 and an explanatory effect comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12."</seg>
<seg id="85">"moreover, in week 12 Aripiprazole showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of mania like lithium or haloperidol."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in a placebo-controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features, which in some cases did not respond to lithium or valproar monotherapy in therapeutic serum concentrations, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazole showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate."</seg>
<seg id="87">"10 In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long-term expansion phase over 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilisation phase prior to randomisation, Aripiprazole was superior to the prevention of a bipolar retreat, mainly in the prevention of a relapse in mania."</seg>
<seg id="88">"based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for Dehydration and hydroxyagulation of Aripiprazole, the N-Dealkyylation is catalysed by CYP3A4."</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean elimination of elimination is approximately 75 hours for aripiprazole with extensive metabolites over CYP2D6 and at approximately 146 hours in 'bad' (= "poor") metabolisers using CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">"in Aripiprazole there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, and in pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenic patients no gender dependent effects were observed."</seg>
<seg id="91">A non-specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics gave no indication of clinically significant differences regarding the ethnicity or the impact of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe renal insufficiency compared to young healthy subjects.</seg>
<seg id="93">"a single dose study in subjects with different liver cirrhosis (child-pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity."</seg>
<seg id="94">"the preclinical data, based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and the carcinogenic potential, did not allow the preclinical data to detect any particular danger for the human being."</seg>
<seg id="95">"toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or expositions, which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, thus only limited or no meaning for clinical use."</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent side-kidney toxicity (lipofuscin pigment accumulation and / or parenchyma-cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at a recommended maximum dose of 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 10 times the mean Steady State Exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">"in addition, a cholelithiasis was observed as a result of the precipitation of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazole in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2)."</seg>
<seg id="98">"however, the concentrations found in the human bile at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg. of hydroxy- Aripiprazole were no more than 6% of the concentrations found in the study more than 39 weeks in the gall of monkeys, and are far below the limit values (6%) of in vitro solubility."</seg>
<seg id="99">"in rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages leading to expositions of 3 and 11 times the mid-size Steady State AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose."</seg>

<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an anti-cryptootubules compound that promotes the transfer of microtubules from the tubulations and stabilizes microtubules by blocking their depolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubular network that is essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin mediates the transcytosis of plasma components into the endothelial cells and in the context of in-vitro studies it has been demonstrated that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel by endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is believed that this improved transsendothelial transport is conveyed by the gp-60-albumrezeptor and a paclitaxel accumulation in the area of the tumor occurs due to the albumbi protein acidic rich in cysteine.</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two single-arm unconnected studies and 454 patients treated in a randomized Phase III comparative study.</seg>

<seg id="1531">Dosage and frequency of application are based on whether advates are used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding during surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">"patients with hemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, causing blood clots like bleeding in joints, muscles or internal organs."</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma but produced according to a method called "recombinant DNA technology."</seg>

<seg id="1535">"advate is similar to another drug approved in the European Union called Recombinate, but is produced in a different way so that the drug does not contain proteins of human or animal origin."</seg>
<seg id="1536">"in three additional studies on patients with severe to moderate haemophilia A, including a study of 53 children under six years, the use of the drug was examined for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures."</seg>

<seg id="1538">"the most common side effects of Advate (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies to Factor VIII."</seg>

<seg id="1540">"in March 2004, the European Commission granted Baxter AG a permit for the placing of lawyers throughout the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage and duration of substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency and the location and extent of bleeding and the patient's clinical condition.</seg>

<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be traced back to the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main efficacy measurements were the changes in the severity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">"during the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours."</seg>

<seg id="1662">"when only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was seen, patients with aaaze showed a reduction of the symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in the patients who had lost the loss of Desloratadin alone."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the most common side effects of aero (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycardia, mouth dry, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (sleeplessness), somnolency (somnolency), sleep disorders and nervousness."</seg>

<seg id="2638">"following IV administration of Palonosetron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean (± SD) increase in the palonosetron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34% between day 1 and day 5."</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokinetic simulations suggest that at once daily intravenous dosage of 0.25 mg palonosetron was comparable to the value measured after a one-time IV administration of 0.75 mg; however the CMAx was higher after the one-time rating of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">"approximately 40% are eliminated through the kidneys, and about another 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor compared to Palonosetron."</seg>

<seg id="2660">"in June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) adopted a negative report in which the allocation of approval for the marketing of the medicines intended for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Alpheleon 6 million IE / ml injection solution."</seg>
<seg id="2661">"this means that Alpheleon should resemble a biological medicine called roferon-A with the same practitioner, which is already approved in the EU (also called" "reference resin agents" ")."</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (liver disease induced by virus infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in a microscopic examination, the liver tissue damages damages, and the values of the liver enzyme Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) in the blood standard have been increased."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"it is produced by a yeast produced by a gene (DNA), which stimulates the metabolism of the active substance."</seg>
<seg id="2665">"the manufacturer of Alpheeon submitted data demonstrating the comparison of Alpheeon with Roferon-A (substance structure, composition and purity of the drug, mode of action, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C)."</seg>
<seg id="2666">"in the study of hepatitis C patients, the efficacy of alpheleon was compared with the efficacy of the reference resin to 455 patients."</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study measured how many patients responded to the drug after 12 of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after treatment (i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">"furthermore, concerns were expressed that the data for the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed do not suffice."</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of hepatitis C patients who responded to treatment with Alpheleon and Roferon-A was similar in the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"after setting the treatment with Alpheeon, the disease rose again in more patients than with the reference resin; in addition, Alpheleon had more side effects."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"apart from this, the test conducted in the study was not sufficiently validated to determine the extent to which the drug acts as an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine)."</seg>
<seg id="2673">"it can be used to treat Impetigo (a skin infection associated with crust formation) and small infected spawns (crack or cuts), abrasions and sewn wounds."</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections that have been demonstrably or presumably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because alarms may not act against this type of infection.</seg>
<seg id="2675">"Altargo may be used in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years, the skin area to be treated may not exceed 2% of the body's surface."</seg>
<seg id="2676">"if the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments."</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced) and thereby inhibit the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was diskled after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">"119 (85.6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52,1%) of 71 patients under placebo responded to the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="2680">"in the treatment of infected skin findings, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: when the results of both studies were taken together in Hautwunden, approximately 90% of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="2681">"however, in these two studies, Altargo was not effective enough in treating abscesses (egg-filled cavities in the body tissue) or from infections caused by MRSA."</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is an irritation at the job site.</seg>
<seg id="2683">"the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo in short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections were outweighed against the risks: • Impetigo, • infected little Lazerations, abrasions or sewn wounds."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in May 2007, the European Commission granted approval to the company Glaxo Group Ltd. a permit for the transport of Altargo across the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined and an alternative therapy should be considered (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">"in case of sensitization or severe local irritation by the use of Retapamulin ointment, treatment is canceled, the ointment is carefully wiped out and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection is started."</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin is not intended to treat infections in which MRSA is known as pathogen or suspected (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">The efficacy of retinamicin in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or deterioration of the infected area occurs after a 2- or 3-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of Retapamulin and other topical remedies on the same skin area has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">"due to the low plasma concentrations that have been achieved in humans after topical application on skimmed skin or infected superficial wounds, a clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not to be expected (see section 5.2)."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"3 After a simultaneous oral administration of 2 times a day, 200 mg of ketoconazole increased the mean retinamiculin AUC (0-24) and CMAx after topical application of 1% Retapamulin ointment on deported skin of healthy adult men by 81%."</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical application dose adjustment is not required if topical reapamiculin is applied during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral consumption and are inadequate with regard to a statement on effects on the birth and the fetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">"Retapamulin ointment should only be applied during pregnancy, when a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of retinamicin is preferable to the application of a systemic antibiotic."</seg>
<seg id="2696">Deciding whether breastfeeding should continue / stop or the therapy with Altargo should be continued / stopped is to weigh between the benefit of breastfeeding for the infant and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">"in clinical studies of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, which have applied to Altargo, the most commonly reported adverse effect was irritation on the date of the administration that concerned about 1% of patients."</seg>
<seg id="2698">"the mode of operation Retapamululin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance which is isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus)."</seg>
<seg id="2699">Retapamulin's action mechanism is based on selective inhibiting of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction on a specific binding site of the bacterial ribosome that differs from binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the binding site ribosomal protein L3 is involved and lies in the region of the ribosomal P-binding site and the Peptidyltransferase center.</seg>
<seg id="2701">"through binding on this binding site, Pleuromutiline inhibits the peptide transfer, block partial P-binding interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ribosomal subunits."</seg>
<seg id="2702">"due to the local prevalence of resistance to the use of retinamicin at least some infection forms, a consultation should be sought by experts."</seg>
<seg id="2703">"there were no differences in the in vitro activity of retinamicin opposite S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin."</seg>
<seg id="2704">"in case of failure to treat S.aureus, the presence of strains with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered."</seg>
<seg id="2705">"resorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% Retapamulin ointment was applied daily under occlusion to intact and peened skin for up to 7 days."</seg>
<seg id="2706">"of 516 patients (adults and children), who received 1% Retapamulin ointment twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained."</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and in the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>

<seg id="2709">"metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of retinamicin in human liver microsomites was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, with low participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5)."</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged between 1 and 15 years who are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">"Ambirix is used as part of a vaccination plan consisting of two doses, whereby protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered."</seg>
<seg id="2725">"for this reason, Ambirix may only be used when there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during immunization and it is ensured that the vaccination plan can be brought to an end in two doses."</seg>

<seg id="2728">"after a child has received the vaccine, the immune system detects the viruses and surface antigens as" foreign "and produces antibodies against it."</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same constituents as the vaccine Twinrix Adults approved since 1996 and the vaccinated vaccine Twinrix children since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">"the three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, but Twinrix Adults and Twinatrix children are administered as part of a vaccination plan consisting of three doses."</seg>
<seg id="2731">"because Ambirix and TwinPeak award adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data supporting the application of Twinrix Adults were also used as a cover for the application of Ambirix."</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">"in an additional study of 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six month and a 12 month gap between the two injections."</seg>
<seg id="2734">"in between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children, Ambirix initiated a month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B."</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambirix was similar to a six-month gap between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">"the most common side effects of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, lack of appetite, pain on the injection site, redness, fatigue and irritability."</seg>

<seg id="2743">"3 As with all injection vaccines, for the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction after the gift of the vaccine appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately."</seg>
<seg id="2744">"if a faster protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardization scheme with the combination vaccine is recommended that contains 360 ELISA units formalin-inactivated Hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen."</seg>
<seg id="2745">"in hemodialysis patients and people with disorders of the immune system, there may be no adequate anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibody, which may be necessary in these cases."</seg>

<seg id="2965">"Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children aged six years with diabetes who need insulin treatment."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"Apidra is subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thigh or upper arm injected or administered as a permanent infusion with an insulin pump."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels (sugar) in the blood, or that insulin can not be processed effectively."</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin secretion differs very slightly from the insulin and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter duration than a short-acting human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">"Apidra was studied in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1,549 adults and in a study of 572 children aged between four and 17 years."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"in type 2 diabetes, in which the body cannot work effectively, Apidra was studied in a study of 878 adults."</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2972">"in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes, a decrease of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was determined after six months compared to a reduction of 0.14% in insulin lapses."</seg>
<seg id="2973">"in adults with type 2 diabetes, the reduction in HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% in human normal insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Apidra may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin, or any of the other ingredients, or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycemia."</seg>
<seg id="2975">Doses of Apidra may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"in September 2004, the European Commission granted approval to the company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH a permit for the placing of Apidra in the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"Apidra can be used as subcutaneous injection either in the abdominal wall, the thigh or the delta muscle or subcutaneous through continuous infusion in the area of the abdominal area."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"due to reduced glucose levels and reduced insulin metabolism, insulin needs in patients with a reduction in liver function can be reduced."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the method of production may result in a change in insulin requirements."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"3 A inadequate dose or termination of treatment, especially in patients with insulin-based diabetes, may lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life threatening."</seg>
<seg id="2981">Switching a patient to another type of insulin or insulin in another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may make a change in dosage required.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycemia depends on the effective profile of the insulin used and can therefore change when changing the treatment plan.</seg>
<seg id="2983">"the substances that can increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase the tendency to hypoglycaemia are oral antidiabetics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, pentoxifyllin, propoxyphine, propoxyphine, Salizylate and sulfonamide antibiotics."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"in addition, the symptoms of the adrenergic counter-regulation can be weakened or missing under the effect of sympathizers such as beta blockers, clonidin, guanethidine and reserves."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"animal experimental studies on reproductive toxicity did not show any differences between insu- linglulisine and human insulin in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"it is not known whether insulin secretion occurs in human breast milk, but in general insulin is not absorbed in breast milk, nor is it resorbed to oral application."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"the following are listed from clinical studies, listed according to system bodies and sorted by decreasing frequency of their occurrence (very common: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; rare: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; very rare: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; very rare: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; rare: ≥ 1 / 100; often not estimated based on available data)."</seg>

<seg id="2989">"lipodystrophy Uses to continuously change the injection unit within the injection area, may result in a lipodystrophy at the injection site."</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycaemia with unconsciousness can be treated by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg) administered by a correspondingly trained person or by intravenous glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">"after a glucoagonal injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypoglycemia and avoid similar episodes."</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake (especially through skeletal musculature and fat) as well as by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in subcutaneous GA- be insulin secretions occur more quickly and the active duration is shorter than with cou- manem normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">"in a study with 18 male persons aged between 21 and 50 years with type 1 diabetes melli- tus, insulin secretion in the therapeutic relevant dosage range from 0,075 to 0.15 E / kg showed a disproportionate glucosal effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a disproportionate increase in the glucosal effect, just like human insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin secretion has twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the full glucosal effect about 2 hours earlier than a human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">"from the data it was obvious that in an application of insulin ulisin 2 minutes before the meal, comparable post-prandial glycaemic control is achieved, as with a human normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"when insulin was served in 2 minutes before the meal, a better post-prandial control was achieved than with a normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"if insulin is applied in 15 minutes after the meal begins, a comparable glycaemic control is achieved, as with a human normal insulin, which is given 2 miths before the meal (see Figure 1)."</seg>
<seg id="2999">"insulin dosage in gift 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the beginning of the meal was given before the beginning of the meal (Figure 1A) and compared to a normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B)."</seg>
