&quot; you can translate the module website in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras website . from the drop @-@ down list , select the source and target language of the translation . &quot;
&quot; if a part of the text is selected , only this part of the text will be translated . &quot;
&quot; machine translations are only very ru@@ di@@ mentary . in the best case , bab@@ el@@ fish produces a crude translation and in the worst case non@@ sense . therefore , translations do not depend on important decisions without checking the translation before . &quot;
only websites on the Internet can be translated . other texts should be translated to the Bab@@ el@@ fish page itself where you can insert translated text directly .
&quot; package &amp; package ; includes various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite their small size , they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making these easier available . &quot;
&quot; for more information on the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , and the built @-@ in functions , see the manual on &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &quot;
&quot; to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Settings extensions ... Open the map tab tools and select the modules you want . &quot;
this is a list of standard settings modules from the k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that you may have more modules on your system if you have additional software installed .
&quot; you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; it contains before you compile this package . &quot;
&quot; to use the crash module , click on the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; on extras crashes . then you can view the page that caused &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or delete the list of crashes , if available . &quot;
the module view filter ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras area filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current working directory in different ways .
&quot; to use DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to use , select DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed website . as default , the display begins with the root node of the document , for example : the element , all other no@@ des are sub @-@ elements of this root node . &quot;
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides a further view of objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory in local files . it can be used as an alternative to the different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system .
&quot; the peculi@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists of visu@@ al@@ ising ne@@ sted folder hierarch@@ ies using a so @-@ called tree map . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must have the property , that the sum of the sizes of the subordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object . &quot;
&quot; &amp; FS@@ View ; reflects the size of a file or folder , and the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries is specified . thus , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; -@@ command you will be considered . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View , an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap is a rect@@ angle representing a file or folder in your file system . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched over view of color mode , can be either depth for easy recognition of the depth or mapping of another file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type . &quot;
&quot; a rect@@ angle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each property , you can determine if it is displayed at all , only if there is enough space to display , or whether the area of the signed rect@@ angle is to be used . in addition , you can set the relative position of the cap@@ tion in the rect@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; in case of Tre@@ em@@ ap for Tre@@ em@@ aps , the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this goal is not always observed . &quot;
&quot; depending on the layout of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries , the implementation remains up to the implementation . in this context , it is always advantageous for the labelling and avoid@@ ance of space losses due to frames which are square . the best methods in this regard are lines , columns or recur@@ sive branches . &quot;
&quot; you can set the minim@@ ally represented area for an entry on the menu item View An@@ hold on Area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn to the area of the higher @-@ level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry . &quot;
&quot; originally was &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map Wid@@ gets , which was developed for the application K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind . &quot;
the image gallery module can be found in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras picture gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .
&quot; when you call the image gallery module , a dialog opens , allowing you to set the image of the gallery . &quot;
the Tit@@ le of the page allows you to adjust the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field .
the option images per line has a slider and a script to adjust the number of thumb@@ nails of each line in the gallery .
&quot; with the check box fil@@ en@@ ame of the image , you can indicate whether the file names will be displayed in the gallery under the mini @-@ pictures . &quot;
&quot; with the check box file size of the image , you can indicate whether the file size is displayed in the gallery in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; with the check box image size , you can indicate whether the size of the images is displayed in the images in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; in the Fol@@ der dialog , specify where the gallery is stored and which sub@@ folders are to be included . &quot;
&quot; in the file selection Save in HTML file , specify where the HTML page should be saved . &quot;
&quot; with the check box sub@@ folder , you can set the sub@@ folder to which level the sub@@ folder will be included . &quot;
&quot; with the check box original pictures , you can specify whether the original images should be copied to the gallery . &quot;
&quot; using the commentary box , you can specify a comment file for the cap@@ tion of the images in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; in the check box O@@ wn colour depth , you can set a different color depth for the thumb@@ nail images than in the original pictures . &quot;
the module &amp; HTML ; settings gives you easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings can be found in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras HTML Settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :
&quot; the media playback for the navigation pane can be found in the &quot; &quot; &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or &quot; &quot; menu , or with the F@@ 9 keyboard short@@ cut . &quot;
&quot; to play , click on the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or &apos;s navigation area ; and drag the music files you want to hear in the media playback . &quot;
&quot; to change browser identification , add a menu entry in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or , which allows you to change browser and operating system identi@@ fiers for single domains . this is useful for websites that allow access to certain browsers only . &quot;
&quot; the standard browser detection of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; is Mozilla / 5.0 ( compatible ; Kon@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ eck@@ o ) . if you come to a website that refuses to access this browser , change your browser identi@@ fier in one of the following options . &quot;
&quot; changes the identi@@ fier in M@@ SI@@ E for pages that refuse access to browsers on the basis of Mozilla . for example , you need the M@@ SI@@ E browser detection to call the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; Hot@@ mail . &quot;
pages that do not comply with the W3@@ C standard or use your own &amp; HTML ; - elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identi@@ fier of this outdated browser .
&quot; with this option , the default browser detection is used for all pages of the site you are currently viewing . &quot;
with the menu entry ... you can set the range of information about the used browser and operating system in the individual .
with this &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ module check your &amp; CSS ; -@@ style sheets and &amp; HTML ; -@@ documents in accordance with the recommendations of the W3@@ C and other standards .
check the website of the website in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or menu under Extras website . you can make the following tests :
&quot; with the &amp; HTML , check if your &amp; HTML ; -@@ document of the syntax of &amp; HTML ; corresponds , all found errors are displayed . with this review , you can make sure that your pages are displayed correctly by all browsers . &quot;
allows you to check your &amp; CSS ; style sheets embedded in a &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; document . with valid &amp; CSS ; your web pages have a uniform look regardless of the browser you are using .
checks the links on your site on for@@ warding and incorrect connections . recur@@ sively all links are checked on the website .
here you place the addresses of the servers for checking your &amp; HTML ; -@@ documents and &amp; CSS ; -@@ style sheets .
&quot; with the module web archive for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , you can save web pages with text and pictures in .@@ was format . &quot;
&quot; click on the Extras website with the mouse , and a dialog appears to save the displayed website . &quot;

&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is made available to you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly into &amp; digi@@ kam ; albums can be downloaded . of course , any medium and any card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; contains fast image processing with basic image editing tools . you can use them to view , comment , rate and correct your photos . the editing skills can be easily extended with K@@ DE Image Plug @-@ ins Interface ( manual ) modules . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; digi@@ kam is easy to use , dozens of professional capabilities are available . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion by li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC colour management workflow . &quot;
&quot; improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; via camera or lens to search for . &quot;
&quot; like all &amp; none ; programs are also &amp; digi@@ kam , an open source project . that means it depends on the support of the end users . therefore , you should report problems and improvements . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; tries to make reporting problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , the Help menu will open a page in the error reporting system . all required information is already registered here . just follow the instructions to send your report . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a project supported by a community . that is , users and developers can help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , then we would like to encourage you to answer questions to other users . &quot;
you can also visit the digi@@ code ; visit homepage to learn news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam .
&quot; the best start to participate &amp; digi@@ ve ; to participate , is the registration in the developer mailing list . instructions for logging in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ kam ; . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , you &apos;ll be asked where you want to save your images and your database . simply enter a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter the path name or click the Fol@@ der icon to select a folder . &quot;
&quot; in the second field , you have to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data backup is saved . this path stays the same for all image folders . &quot;
&quot; later , you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will be additionally used as an al@@ der library . &quot;
&quot; when you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top@@ most folder that contains images , as basic folder . &amp; digi@@ kam ; viewing each sub@@ folder as an album . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ kam ; dur@@ ates recur@@ sively the library path throughout its depth . you can &apos;t exclude any sub@@ folders unless it i@@ ste in hidden folder . this allows you to insert one point before the name of the sub@@ folder .
&quot; if you have an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ list don &apos;t have any photos as symbols . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the base folder , you can set up &amp; edit your digital camera . then you should learn how to use My Albums and My Key@@ word list to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported shell cameras in the Help shell support menu . &quot;
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h @-@ Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h workflow .
&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is made available to you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly into &amp; digi@@ kam ; albums can be downloaded . of course , any medium and any card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash , Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses the g@@ Photo@@ 2 program to communicate with digital camera . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely distributed protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows to transfer images from digital cameras to computers and other peripher@@ als without the need of additional drivers . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos in general are large files and trans@@ missions over the serial port are slow , this connection is now obsol@@ ete . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link . &quot;
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support so that thumb@@ nails can be read reliably by some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 camera operators . if the Ex@@ if support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 you may not be able to see thumb@@ nails or the creation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things to do &amp; digi@@ code is how easy it is to extend its functionality by modules :
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plug @-@ ins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ kam ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way as it can also be a user . their advantage is that it is much simpler , &amp; digi@@ kam ; by writing a small module to add a function when the changes in &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; to simplify the window , you can either remove the page strips with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F . &quot;
&quot; drag and drop images works everywhere : you can put an image in another part of the tree , above the horizontal divi@@ der line or another application window . the only limitation is that a picture cannot be stored in keywords , date list or search . &quot;
&quot; - a file type selection allows you to extract the most common : JPEG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio &quot;
&quot; the text filter will only be used for the fields displayed in the symbol view currently . thus , filtering on the fil@@ en@@ ame will only work if this is displayed in the symbol view . &quot;
&quot; view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view on your photo albums . all photos stored by &amp; digi@@ kam , are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted according to their collection in the legacy properties or by the date on which the album was first created , and the date can be changed in the properties of the album . &quot;
&quot; if you have set up a scanner , you can scan a photo directly into an album . select File Import images . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album . &quot;
&quot; to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there . in the pop @-@ up menu you have to choose whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all photos and move them to the destination album . &quot;
&quot; an album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to collect information about this collection . to access the album properties , you have to right @-@ click on the album and select album properties in the contex@@ tual menu . &quot;
&quot; album Collec@@ tions : are a method to mark your albums so that you can be group@@ ed under a common name . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do this in the collections for collections . &quot;
the album date : is used when you sort your albums by date with view albums sorted by date .
&quot; buttons el@@ dest , average , new : these put the date on that of the oldest , the newest picture or the average of the album . to do this , first try to calculate the average of the images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , instead the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder . &quot;
&quot; when you first recorded an album in &amp; digi@@ kam , the first picture in the album is selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this is to help you remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , you must click the picture with the right mouse button and select in the context menu &amp; quot ; As an album preview , select . in addition you can drag the photo to the album in the list to put it as a symbol . &quot;
an album can always only be included in a collection and collections cannot be ne@@ sted .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the area My Key@@ word list at the bottom left of the main window . album collections have a different effect . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
&quot; the image window will show you the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images will be displayed in this album in the picture window . each photo will be displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview with the two magni@@ fying buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; if you open an album for the first time , you have to wait a little while the preview images are generated . &quot;
&quot; information about each image will be displayed below the corresponding preview . what information this is , you can edit via Settings ; set it up . select the Albums tab here and adjust the area preview images to your wishes . &quot;
the thumb@@ nails have help windows that appear . if you let the mouse po@@ inter rest a moment over a picture . the help shows the most important features including all keywords of a photo . the screen shot at the top of the introduction to the main window shows such help window .
&quot; photos are all you need to do with &amp; digi@@ kam . albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures in a way that suits you . you can choose all the functions that are done with &amp; digi@@ kam . you can choose between viewing the pictures , a slide show or editing the pictures . &quot;
you can open the image editing with a photo by using either F@@ 4 image editing ... or selecting the contex@@ tual menu of the image with the right mouse button and editing ... Select a tutorial on how to edit your photos . using the image editing you can view and edit your photos .
&quot; you can open a photo in another program by opening the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the sub @-@ menu of opening . this , and how to adjust it to your needs , if your program is not listed , you will find information in the &amp; k@@ de ; manual . &quot;
&quot; you should note that after processing other image processing programs it can come to problems with the metadata contained in the image . some programs do not store these data when you store the modified image . thus , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture etc . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides two options for turning . the easiest is to click the right mouse button to preview and rotate . in the sub @-@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
&quot; to change the file name of a photo , right click on the preview and select F@@ 2 Ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you have the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete a photo from &amp; digi@@ ve ; delete , it will be moved to the M@@ ül@@ heim by &amp; k@@ de ; F@@ 8 Image Del@@ ete or Del@@ ete If you rather want to delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del@@ ete . &quot;
&amp; quot ; My data list quot ; organizes your photos using the data . &amp; digi@@ kam ; use either the EX@@ IF date or if it is not available the date of the last change of the file .
&quot; if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the Picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet at the bottom of the date page to show you only the photos of the selected days . &quot;
&quot; keywords are provided with a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . keywords are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups . as soon as a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search . &quot;
&quot; if a keyword is selected , all photos marked with this keyword will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . by doing so , you can easily organize your keywords . you can also easily find parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My Key@@ word Li@@ ste@@ ak ; so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for . &quot;
&quot; the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and allocated keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , so you can also use your keywords in other programs . &quot;
&quot; you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking on &amp; quot ; My keywords , or click on an existing keyword and then select New keyword . if you click on an existing keyword , this keyword will be added to this keyword . &quot;
&quot; you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo . &quot;
&quot; you can change the position of a keyword , drag it to the desired position in the tree and place it there . then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to move the keyword to move . a keyword can only be in the tree at a time . &quot;
you can change the properties of a keyword by right @-@ clicking it and selecting the keyword in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords .
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , you have to click the picture with the right mouse button and select as an album preview in the context menu . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the photos you want to use with keyword , you can drag them to the appropriate keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My point &apos; ; drag and drop them there . alternatively , you can also click the right mouse button on the preview images and select the keyword list from the contex@@ tual menu . &quot;
&quot; you can add a photo with any number of keywords . the photo is displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords attached to it . in this way , you can assign a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event where it was made , etc . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided a photo with keywords , it will be displayed in the main window under the preview of the image . &quot;
&quot; you can remove a keyword , in which you can open the contex@@ tual menu of the photos with the right mouse button and select from the Tags menu . the menu only displays the keywords that were assigned to the photo . &quot;
the tim@@ eline view shows a time @-@ dependent adjusted hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved by this hist@@ ogram . to select a tim@@ eline you just have to click on the bottom rect@@ angle of the selection frame that indicates the time unit .
&quot; in the field below , you can enter a title and save your selection . this will appear in the list below . &quot;
&quot; includes all elements of the database : names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamp and in the future even more . &quot;
&quot; Neb@@ ula er Such@@ box is a small lamp the green becomes when the search finds matches . if you click here , the filtering will be deleted and all pictures will be shown again . if the search hasn &apos;t found anything , then the lamp becomes red . &quot;
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with the bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this you get a simple search box as described above .
&quot; if you are happy with your selection , press OK and search will be performed . the results will be displayed in my search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection after searching , you just have to select the corresponding entry from the View My search list and select an option in its context menu . &quot;
&quot; if you select to edit the search , the search will be entered again with the search information entered before . if you select As Advanced Search , the Advanced Search dialog will appear to you . more information can be found in the section The Tool for Advanced Search . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Del@@ ete in the context menu Search . &quot;
&quot; the Advanced Search will provide you with an extended search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in specific fields of &amp; digi@@ kam ; s database . &quot;
&quot; the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the database database . any option can be added to this list with search group / search group deleted , or deleted from it . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; characterized by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures . the smaller the difference between two image signatures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot;
&quot; similar entries : this is an area in which you can drop every picture to find a similar . by means of a sw@@ ell@@ erts , the result selection can be enlarged or reduced . if you push a picture from somewhere over the symbol of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can drop it there . &quot;
sket@@ ch : free @-@ hand ink sket@@ ch : draw a quick sket@@ ch and &amp; digi@@ ve ; find the matching images . also here a threshold value can be set .
&quot; this tab provides an intuitive Explorer search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini @-@ program . you can press the mouse wheel in or out or move it and move it . move it while you click the left mouse button . move it while you click the left mouse button . all images inside these coordinates are filtered and displayed . of course , this pres@@ upp@@ oses that your images contain ge@@ o data . &quot;
&quot; in the field below you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter , which will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live geo@@ file . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; provides a table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files . &quot;
&quot; select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L To add the light table from the contex@@ tual menu . the selection will be added to the light table and its window will open . &quot;
&quot; from the preview panel , you can drag the images you want to compare in the left or right area of the window . a small arrow shows you what copy to see in which window area . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of pictures . if you navigate in pairs from the tool@@ bar , then the two first images are automatically loaded into the areas for the comparison . &quot;
&quot; of course , the normal delete actions work directly from the light table like e.g. F@@ 4 file ... &quot;
all image information from the right @-@ hand side bar of the main window is available for both thumb@@ nails in the illuminated table . this makes it e.g. easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
&quot; in the lower end of each area you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function , which you can see on the crossed arrows . to rotate the visible area of the picture , hold them and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; then both pictures will show the same image area . &quot;
the zo@@ oming works just as in other views . simply use the Zoom knob under the pictures or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out .
&quot; what is a digital inventory management - apart from the fashion word ? digital inventory management considers every part of the process , following the image has been taken up to the final output and the permanent storage . &quot;
&quot; we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips how to back up your pictures , find , protect , and use photos again . we will focus on the process for digital photographers that &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Digital Stock Management takes on , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , sec@@ ures , seeks , transforms , conf@@ uses and exports contents that have a monetary or cultural value . &quot;
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is stored in accordance with your definition data that provides information about or a documentation of other data managed by an application or environment .
&quot; if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then use no inventory management longer to find a certain photo . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you don &apos;t need to use &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you need to do and know before you install anything in your system is the structure information structure in contrast to the data structure . you need to decide whether you want to save them to a reserved disk , or on a network drive &amp; etc . make sure you have to switch to a larger disk at some point . &quot;
&quot; you may be happy about your location unless you were in one year several times the same place . the remaining photos will be organized on the basis of your date . if you do enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have different requirements such as version@@ ing photos , archiving , work procedures , constant supply of images to different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % of archives and 5 % work files will have and you will not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content . &quot;
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new files from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a deriv@@ ative picture .
&quot; we also recommend the metadata to be saved in &amp; digi@@ kam &apos;s settings page . this ensures that EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data can be written into the file . if you forget this , then you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the corresponding item in the Album &apos;s menu . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change which ? &quot;
&quot; of course , you can choose all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value then . you start best with the rating or ranking . this makes sense as you can focus on the best photos in the next work . &quot;
&quot; now let &apos;s go with keywords , keywords , as you often call other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
&quot; if you import catalo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ kam ; automatically build the tree for you , and can easily arrange the images to the right place . &quot;
&quot; the graphic shows how different metadata is overl@@ apped . this is a very rough representation , since each block of metadata consists of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all images . &quot;
&quot; enough of the keywords - the next section refers to labels or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t want to let anybody see your photos simply , you want to share them with your friends , family , photographers and agencies . &quot;
&quot; look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it more closely , then you start to see some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; wow ! you start to dream , to have associations , memories , the historical period of time is present again , you may even hear the silence . so , the cap@@ tion has changed your perception of this panorama completely . &quot;
&quot; for others who view your photos , the title may be more important than the picture itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . &quot;
&quot; it is fine if a picture is not perfect , if it has the strength only to work with an inscription for itself alone . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; digi@@ kam , you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alpha@@ bet ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) . you can even export it to a selection of images simultaneously . if you export your images in web galleries , then these labels will be exported to your wishes in the cap@@ tion and / or the title of the web gallery system . &quot;
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find another town without a navigation system ? wasn &apos;t it a boring planet in front of Google Earth ? well because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation is already moving at the speed of light .
&quot; the possibilities to exploit ge@@ olo@@ cation are countless and will be deep@@ ened in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtual repeat your trips via pictures with geographic data . you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a pu@@ n with copyright and design@@ ates the practice to use copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ edoms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the work of others . &quot;
&quot; the following description tells you which information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ kam , which should be stored as information : &quot;
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo , then the name of a company or organization can be used . this field does not support either comm@@ as or sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; author title : associated with the author . this field contains the photographer &apos;s work name . examples of this can be titles as : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . &quot;
&quot; publisher ( syn@@ onym for sellers ) : use the provider field to identify who offers the photo . if the photographer is a photo agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organisations can be listed here , which offers the image to others . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , even though they do not provide protection against abuse . &quot;
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .
&quot; topics : plate errors , disk failure , black@@ outs , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , disaster prevention , lifetime , temperature , data size , spread super@@ sti@@ tion &quot;
&quot; of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or a fire . these types of losses are the same that can happen to you even with traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . &quot;
&quot; K@@ roll on@@ TRA@@ CK , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which causes a loss of data . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer , harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollars ; 2 the piece that claims a lifetime of 100 years for itself . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk by using good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recor@@ ders are not much more expensive than the cheapest ones , but you write a lot more reliable . &quot;
&quot; 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and control hum@@ ming . despite this massive protection they age through chemical ageing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; for faulty CDs and DVDs , there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that works wonders for CDs and DVDs , but it is not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged disks , hard disks , flash media , USB drives , etc . &quot;
&quot; optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to win the format war against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disk can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all that was said to CDs and DVDs , of course , also applies to the Blu @-@ ray disk . &quot;
&quot; do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read these media . &quot;
&quot; disk manufacturers retain their statistics for themselves . their manufacturer warran@@ ties include a new disk , but not the data . &quot;
&quot; electronic parts of the controller are the most common error reason , S@@ MA@@ RT cannot determine these errors . some of the errors identified by S@@ MA@@ RT indicate the imminent failure . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have backed up the files , but these losses can usually be restored without major problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electrical devices do not make a lot of electricity , this can cause serious damage in devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processors . these can cause serious damage . so , you can damage these anom@@ ali@@ es , complete data loss , hardware aging , destroyed mot@@ her@@ boards and other defects . &quot;
the most common protection against current peaks is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs a portion of the energy heat and gro@@ unded the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in bar . remember that not every plug @-@ in bar also contains an over@@ voltage protection .
&quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , be sure to comply with the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . &quot;
&quot; some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage cont@@ actors , which can also be connected to your modem . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage cont@@ actors which also have a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable mode@@ ms and the TV card . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are developed especially for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem . &quot;
&quot; while over@@ voltage protection protects your system from smaller fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you in a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds may lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore make sense to invest in a interrup@@ tible power supply . &quot;
&quot; besides the protection against over@@ vol@@ tages , these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power failure occurs . this gives you the possibility to save your data and run the system in order . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting . &quot;
&quot; consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its security with the cost of avoiding this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can get you up to &amp; euro ; 40 . this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected . at the end , you should always remember all cables before you go on holiday . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web service contains S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . using the right configuration , you can mount it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software . &quot;
&quot; however , you are at home very expensive compared to the hard drives - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data on the comparatively slow internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the Photo Community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are stored on photos and you won &apos;t want to have your pictures in full resolution online . &quot;
&quot; from the perspective of data backup , the web solutions are very secure . thanks to the TCP protocol , transmission errors are automatically cleaned and the large companies offer a backup and a distributed memory . thus , they are safe . &quot;
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer . all trans@@ missions are vulnerable to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs are at least secure data integrity between operating system and hard disk .
&quot; the worst thing is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when it happened in your hardware . it &apos;s rather disturbing that there is no protection in your computer . no one seems to have thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer path than that in your computer . &quot;
&quot; un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , as they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are not particularly affected by the transmission problems , you should look into the future . in 2010 , you will see thousands of mistakes a year . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with plate errors at a low level and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GP@@ L in@@ compatible license for Solar@@ is and Leop@@ ard . &quot;
&quot; Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem . it is still in alpha status . it uses the same protection mechanisms used by the Z@@ FS and is also available for &amp; Linux ; however , it is not yet part of the kernel . &quot;
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in the not@@ ebook and 46 % for work@@ station systems .
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to less damage , such as theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; has long been no longer seen . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less prone to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most widespread file systems . find a very good English article here . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden break during operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not fully stored before the problem occurred , it is lost . &quot;
&quot; viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
sensors from digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings of fundamental physical limits . it is meant that while the technology continues to develop there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far from this limit .
even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result rather deterior@@ ates . a sensor size of 6 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els and a high @-@ quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
&quot; you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so don &apos;t worry anyone else for data loss . therefore , 6 % of all PCs are affected by a data loss every year . &quot;
&quot; suppose you make your backup daily on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash hit you luck if the drive was not connected at the moment . &quot;
&quot; forgotten aircraft accidents : fire , water , electricity , children and th@@ ef@@ ts are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect a whole room or the entire house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Des@@ ast@@ er@@ Pre@@ vention always means a non @-@ local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs , into the neighbour house , into your office or something like that . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as stated above , a common reason for a loss of data despite securing the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
&quot; difference protection : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snapshot at two points of time : that of the complete backup , and that of the last differential protection . &quot;
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . generates several snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time in which such a backup was made .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that have really been changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security over ss@@ h .
save important images right after you have saved them on your computer on a DVD or another optical medium .
&quot; at the end , you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . any further di@@ lution should be done manually after you have done a complete review . &quot;
&quot; topics : metadata stored in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original store , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ inv@@ enting images and metadata , copying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , visual equipment , ... , usage of the Internet . &quot;
&quot; so that valuable pictures will survive the next 40 year , that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered : &quot;
&quot; since the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you need to look carefully and re @-@ evaluate everything that is today . unfortunately , there is no other way to be considered as a certain vi@@ gil@@ ance . the less variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to assess the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should be answered by the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards supported by many applications .
&quot; virtualization is now available for everyone . so , if you have an old system that is important to read your images , please keep it and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : each time you change your computer architecture , memory , and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the specialist print for the ability to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have plan@@ ed the scal@@ ability and you want to enlarge the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . you can copy this area and store it to a new record :
&quot; check with the d@@ mes@@ g command if your new record is detected by the system , but don &apos;t hang it . &quot;
&quot; / dev / s@@ db , the new record is / dev / s@@ db , the new record is / dev / s@@ db , the new record is / dev / s@@ db , the new record is / dev / s@@ db , the new record is / dev / s@@ db , the new record is / dev / s@@ db , the new record is / dev / s@@ db , the new disk is / dev / s@@ db , and res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ db / s@@ db / s@@ db ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ db / s@@ db / s@@ db / s@@ db . &quot;
&quot; open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day no more software available that can read it , then you can create it yourself . this task is easier from year to year . &quot;
&quot; GI@@ F is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you should not use it anymore . &quot;
&quot; P@@ NG has been developed as an open source standard to replace GI@@ F . it is los@@ s@@ less , supports X@@ MP , ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 bits per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG can recommend gam@@ ma@@ - and chro@@ mati@@ city data for improved color assignment for hetero@@ geneous platforms . &quot;
TI@@ FF was widely used as an image format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a los@@ s@@ less compression algorithm ( Def@@ late ) . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digital Neg@@ ative File Format is a license @-@ free and open raw image format that was developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG is developed based on the TI@@ FF / EP format and committed to using metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers are now available to D@@ NG and we hope to use the competitor Canon and Nikon .
&quot; X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a coding technology that allows users to em@@ bed their data into a file themselves . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers draw it from an original of your recording , mostly in the raw format , to archive . X@@ MP doesn &apos;t want to store the metadata separately from the image file , but it can also be related to problems when linking the metadata file and the image file . therefore , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything together . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Met@@ adata initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s activities include annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and enligh@@ tening efforts to achieve a far @-@ reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import images from the camera , the card reader or scanner . as long as the images are on the camera edi@@ um , you can use this as a temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save it in your raw archive . this feature is not implemented yet .
&quot; for a fine editing you can use external programs . if you edit the pictures again with &amp; digi@@ ve ; edit , then you should add the metadata again . these were cut off by the other programs . &quot;
&quot; protect the processed images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . only export them to web galleries , code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ ve ; see a description of how you can add photos that you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings to import images to your database . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ ve ; to use , connect them to the computer , turn the camera on the display mode and turn it on . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; some cameras do not display thumb@@ nails . if this is the case , the file names and thumb@@ nails of all photos are displayed on the camera . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for the application for each file , photos , movies , music etc. are displayed on the camera . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the side bars properties and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata . &quot;
this dialog displays file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
&quot; the metadata shows internal metadata such as Ex@@ if , manufacturer notices , GPS , etc . this information is the same as the metadata page bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam , or image editing . note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras . &quot;
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the Download button and then download the selection from all . this downloads all photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ kam .
&quot; if you do not want to download all photos , you can only select the desired selection methods from &amp; k@@ de . once you have selected the photos , use the Download button and then download the selected . the selected download button is gra@@ yed until you have selected some photos . &quot;
&quot; if your camera supports this , a new option is available . these pictures have not been downloaded by &amp; digi@@ kam . in this case , the new images are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , only the new images are downloaded . &quot;
&quot; the list of the existing albums is displayed , as normal folder is sorted , and the list of the existing albums will be displayed in the My Albums section . select the destination album from the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after selecting the destination album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ kam ; load the photos from the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all of them by del@@ eting the Del@@ ete All . if you only want to delete some , you have to select them first and then delete selected items . &quot;
&quot; please note that there is no way to restore photos that you deleted from the camera . you should carefully check if the photos were successful in a &amp; digi@@ pack ; if you want to remove them from the camera . if you want to completely delete the camera folder , you should do this about the camera , as this is much faster . &quot;
&quot; the file names are normally re @-@ inv@@ ali@@ dated after the photos were deleted from the camera . therefore , it can be useful to integrate the date and time when the image has been taken into the file name . &quot;
&quot; in the next section , you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and for data @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder is automatically created per day . &quot;
&quot; the first two refer to the author in the standard auto identity section . if you select this , the corresponding entries are copied from the ex@@ if information in the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you want a different date format than the default format , you can , for example , use the pre@@ fix phot@@ o- % Y@@ - % d % H : % M : % S . &quot;
&quot; if you use the option camera file name , you have the option to change the file names in lo@@ wer@@ case letters . or in Up@@ per@@ cases if you prefer . &quot;
&quot; the new fil@@ en@@ ame , which &amp; digi@@ kam is used for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are saved and automatically used when you open the next time the camera window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; can use all information about orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to perform an automatic rotation during downloading . not all cameras provide this information . in the Side@@ bar Met@@ adata section , you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; automatic rotation is usually enabled , and if your camera does not provide this information , &amp; digi@@ kam ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off automatic rotation , use the Advanced button and select the automatic turn in the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; if your camera provides information about the date the photo was taken , you can use this to automatically download sub @-@ albums in the target album . all images with the same date will be stored in the same sub@@ album . not all cameras provide this information . &quot;
&quot; this option is normally off , and in this case , &amp; digi@@ kam ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to turn on this option . use the Advanced button and select the date based sub @-@ albums at the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to upload photos from your computer to your camera is the button Download . then select Up@@ load . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears , in which you can select the files that are to be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods . &quot;
&quot; after the image selection is done , &amp; digi@@ kam asks you to where the images are to be uploaded . select the folder you want and press OK to start up@@ loading . the images are not deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this means a position that can be displayed in linear and l@@ ati@@ tude gra@@ ds and which can be displayed on a map . determining the data can be carried out by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of the GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architects and real estate agents can use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you later forgot where exactly the photo was taken , you can click a browser to open the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ pack ; users who want to locate the location of the photos , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is , how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that exi@@ v2 has many GPS data fields , such as direction , sem@@ it@@ rail@@ ers and map references . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS receivers . either as a map module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . you must save this data in g@@ p@@ x format as this is the only format supported by the module for geographic mapping .
there are different programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the longitu@@ des and l@@ ati@@ tude or other data , you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the default coordinates created by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not show any European street maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , showing all navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ kam ; tries to give you so much control over its work@@ flows as possible . there are many settings that change the behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam ; set up . the Settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left @-@ hand side .
&quot; select action can be displayed on embedded preview or image editing can be set . you set the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam , if you click on an entry in the main view . &quot;
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written into the respective IP@@ TC data fields if the option is selected when downloading from the camera interface . &quot;
&quot; author title is a syn@@ onym for author &apos;s line : this field should be the professional name of the photographer . this may be names such as employed photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . &quot;
&quot; publisher is a syn@@ onym for sellers : use this field to indicate the photo . this must not be the author if it is for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then the group or agency that provides the image should be listed here . &quot;
&quot; the IP@@ TC actions save the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC ri@@ ms . this will ensure that the metadata is permanently included in the image , and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ kam ; and this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ kam ; imported without losing . &quot;
&quot; image descriptions as embedded lab@@ eling ( J@@ FI@@ F ) save images in JPEG pictures : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the cap@@ tions embedded in the pictures . &quot;
&quot; the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the mouse po@@ inter rests in the main window over a file . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; &amp; # 160 ; digi@@ code ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ kam ; to display , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list . &quot;
you can reset the default settings by pressing the Update button to the right of each category .
&quot; these settings can be set on the default values . each time you open the illuminated table , these settings are not available . however , if you have one , you should only use on fast computers . if you have one , then you can obtain better viewing results . &quot;
&quot; by default , image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select them here . you can disable the tool@@ bar if you use image editing in full screen mode . &quot;
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light color in the picture . these colors are specified here . in image processing this view mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling it is meant that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for the closer explanation .
&quot; with P@@ NG compression setting , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce image quality as P@@ NG uses a los@@ s@@ less algorithm . &quot;
&quot; using the TI@@ FF files option , you can switch the de@@ late compression algorithm for TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of TI@@ FF images . it does not affect image quality as the Def@@ late algorithm works los@@ s@@ less . &quot;
&quot; with the setting loss @-@ free JPEG 2000 files , you can save los@@ s@@ less . even if you select the los@@ sy setting , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than in normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , metadata was not yet supported but was in the planning . &quot;
&quot; in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ kam , image editing was just a picture viewer for photos . currently , it is very fast becoming a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of image editing . &quot;
&quot; the default view is that all green pixels are equal . if the straight green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels in odd lines , this difference creates a grid pattern in the output . this option records the image a bit soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern using the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic ink balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . standard is to use a fixed color balance , based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight . &quot;
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images get more details in four steps . for other cameras this option is ignored .
&quot; the standard is it the pointed lights , so the parts of your images are burned down because of the inability of your camera to catch the pointed lights as a continuous white . finally , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of missing information from the top lights . &quot;
this is possible because blue pixels in general do not satur@@ ate as quickly as green and red . &amp; d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions from the still non @-@ saturated blue pixels . of course this is a question of how much color or white you want .
&quot; if you select the re@@ construct option , you get the option to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each picture . &quot;
&quot; set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably need to set it slightly higher than the standard 1 . however , this can be done later in the image options of &amp; digi@@ kam ; image editing . to keep the time for the dem@@ os@@ a@@ invo@@ icing , you should proceed conserv@@ atively . &quot;
a demo icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the partial raw data that many cameras have and which has a matrix color pixel . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or color design .
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide you with three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks like A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result . &quot;
&quot; if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correc@@ tions here . this is certainly the best method for a color gra@@ ding correction , as it is performed during the rough conversion . &quot;
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions like this should be given . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information like the color information from a color space in the other is to translate the colors as exactly as possible .
behavior Ques@@ tions when an image is opened in image processing / color management module with raw files .
&quot; color profile folder Sets the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you store all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ kam ; examine these folders then during startup . &quot;
settings of ICC profiles You have the option &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to be deposited . everything can be changed later when opening the raw file .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here only your pictures color does not manage the entire screen .
&quot; the input profiles should suit the camera manufacturer and model you are using . not all profiles are created in the same way . currently , d@@ cra@@ w G@@ amma correc@@ ts not for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to perform the color mapping yourself . &quot;
&quot; there are other options like the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile to em@@ ulate how your image would be returned from a device . this is very useful before you print image , as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors therefore can be very saturated . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras , it is quite obvious which colour profile is intended for . unfortunately not with Canon &apos;s models . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is , of course , un@@ official : &quot;
&quot; Canon &apos;s profile extension leaves the style for the goal : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portrait and S for the standard style . &quot;
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface . it is an interface supported by a number of &amp; K ; image viewer and image processing . by deplo@@ ying this interface can &amp; digi@@ kam ; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
&quot; if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the ones you want to use , and these are then downloaded from &amp; digi@@ kam . these modules will appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition , you will also find some in the context menu of the preview . &quot;
short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings short commands .
further information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plu@@ g@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
&quot; the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper regulator adju@@ sts the time between the picture transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds . &quot;
&quot; on the right side there is a button Automatic Det@@ ection , which is trying to identify a camera connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure the camera is properly connected , switched on and in image display mode . currently , serial , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage are supported . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom end , you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ ve ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring them to the display mode and turn on . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t , you can set camera model and port manually . once you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera &apos;s menu . &quot;
&quot; you can select any name for your camera . it is displayed in the main window &apos;s C@@ ameras . if you have more than one camera , you can paste them here . &quot;
&quot; with the option &quot; &quot; confirmation dialog &quot; &quot; for moving &gt; images in the tr@@ ash bin , you can display &amp; digi@@ ve the conversation ; for del@@ eting a photo in an album , you will find further details in the del@@ e@@ tion of a photo and del@@ eting an album . &quot;
&quot; the editorial changes by the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly used by &amp; digi@@ kam ; apply if you use the option changes in the right side@@ bar without asking questions . otherwise , you will need to apply the changes with the button changes . &quot;
&quot; you can also display &amp; digi@@ ve the welcome screen &apos;s display ; at startup , this speeds up &amp; digi@@ pack the start process . &quot;
&quot; the setting Bei@@ m start searching for new photos is forcing &amp; digi@@ kam ; to locate the base folder after new or deleted albums / photos . this extends the start time of &amp; digi@@ kam ; . if something is deleted from the base folder , &amp; digi@@ kam is requested ; you , if it should delete it from the database . &quot;
different color schemes can be used in &amp; digi@@ kam ; they can be used to adjust the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected from the tool@@ bar &apos;s Settings design . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
&quot; these designs are defined in plain text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam , you will find more information about this in this tutorial . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ kam ; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos and for correction and improvement . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on thumb@@ nail preview and selecting the entry / editing entry .
&quot; the image editing includes a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ kam , so you may not be part of your distribution . for more information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules , see the Image Processing section . &quot;
&quot; a status bar at the bottom of the window , the file name , current fil@@ en@@ ames , magni@@ fying factor and the current image size . &quot;
a menu bar at the top and below the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
&quot; the editing functions of the image editing will change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before using file storage or the Save button from the tool@@ bar . note that you can &apos;t restore the original photo once you have saved the image . &quot;
&quot; so , you should make a copy of your image before you change it . you can do this with file Save as . &quot;
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by re@@ producing from the File Recovery or Rest@@ ore the button Rest@@ ore the image processing Rest@@ ore in the tool@@ bar . you then lose any change you have done in the photo since last saving . &quot;
almost every action of image editing can be und@@ one or restored . the last action can be revers@@ ed by modi@@ fying or restoring Edi@@ ting Edi@@ ting from the menu .
&quot; if you use this frequently , you should use the keyboard short@@ cuts , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z to undo and mark C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore . &quot;
&quot; when you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; press a moment longer via the return or restore button in the tool@@ bar , you will receive a contex@@ tual menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in @-@ between will also be revers@@ ed or restored . &quot;
&quot; once you have started image processing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword , using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , picture high , picture down or the entries in the menu file . if you have made changes to the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save them . &quot;
you can enter in the photo and zoom out in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the View menu .
&quot; to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : select En@@ large factor automatically &quot;
view Full Screen mode displays the picture in full screen mode . you come to the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c key . normally you can change this in the editing dialog by &amp; digi@@ kam . you can view it from the editing dialog . see the section for setting up image editing .
&quot; if you want to print the current image , you can print in the File Image menu and get the standard &amp; k@@ de ; Print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu , you can print individual pictures or whole sentences . all image preview pages can be printed out of your selection . you only need to select the images using the standard methods and select from the menu Ex@@ porter Export wizard . if you follow the wizard , you only need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; main window has a side bar at the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same page bar is available without the navigation arrows , also in image editing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked : &quot;
multiple Click on the same tab lets the side@@ bar appear or disappear again into the edge .
the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the cap@@ tions are copied to the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs .
IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and special characters are converted . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications you should follow these restrictions .
&quot; after you have commented it , use either the Apply button or simply switch to the next picture , the cap@@ tions are then saved . &quot;
&quot; next to the user button , there is a button More . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write the metadata in the files . this will always be done when you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written into the images . &quot;
the review section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in searches and sor@@ rows . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the lateral bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 .
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field Ur@@ gency . the coding follows the scheme in the following table :
&quot; the keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keyword tree and a selection box with the keyword listed previously in this &amp; digi@@ pack ; -@@ session . &quot;
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word . you can limit the number of options when searching for a keyword . this ability is particularly useful when you have a lot of keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom end is a further relief when entering keywords in a picture series . if you have entered various keywords , they are stored for quick access . &quot;
keywords can also be set by selecting the appropriate check boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC field keyword .
&quot; if several images are selected in the main screen and you select a keyword in the keyword tree , it will only be applied to the highlighted image and not the entire selection , if you want to provide a selection with a keyword , please read the section Key@@ word filter . &quot;
&quot; the page bar keyword filters are used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side bar is used with their album , - date , keyword and search views . if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; you can also drag and drop keywords in the main view . if the keyword already exists , you can simply pull it out of the right side@@ bar and place it on the selection . then a dialog appears that asks you if you want to set the keyword . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example , the main window displays the images on a calendar day . the keyword filter is based on No keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . &quot;
this search for changes takes place at each start of the program . it can also be switched off under Settings Mis@@ cellaneous .
&quot; if you have a rule and realize that it should be one or more , you can easily change this with a double click on the text and in the rule area . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the entry after which is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc . &quot;
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
&quot; for example , you can set an Advanced search for all elements of the database with the following options : &quot;
if you want to group options you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and after that the button group@@ ing . the options then look as follows :
why have Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web and Fli@@ ck@@ r not listed ? the free space is limited to 1@@ GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution .
this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly adapted it to &amp; digi@@ kam ; s concrete implementation .
the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is the colors that come from your camera or scanner . with a color @-@ managed workflow you can achieve that the colors on your monitor are similar to those of your camera or scanner and that match the colors you print or publish on the Web to those from your digital dark@@ room .
&quot; the purpose of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about color management . in addition , links with deeper information will allow you to make your own informed choices so that you get the desired result . &quot;
&quot; if your image workflow ful@@ fills all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management . &quot;
you work on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below )
your only other image editions are by e @-@ mail or web where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard .
&quot; so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone , why should one use another color space and then have to worry about colour management ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of s@@ RGB Lim@@ itation compared to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e region , and the colors in the s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some bigger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
do I have to list my monitor if I chose to work only in the s@@ RGB colour space ?
&quot; yes ! whether you &apos;re working in s@@ RGB colour space or not , you need to al@@ locate your monitor , since s@@ RGB is powered by s@@ RGB . if you are working as a RGB color space , you either have to use your monitor on s@@ RGB standard , use an appropriate monitor profile or both . &quot;

&quot; this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions , which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting any further manual processing . &quot;
&quot; the functions Norm@@ alize , Com@@ par@@ ting , Automatic Termin@@ ation and Con@@ trast extend from the menu Cor@@ rec@@ ting Automatic correction automatically try to make the most of your colors . you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo . &quot;
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aling the cand@@ l@@ esti@@ cks over the entire image so that the dark@@ est point is black and the bri@@ ghtest spot is as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed .
&quot; in the same way , almost every brightness area produces the same number of pixels . sometimes the same amount of pixel results in the same number of pixels . sometimes it produces very good results when improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it also produces garbage . it is a very powerful operation that causes either miracles in an image or destroyed it . &quot;
&quot; automatic adjustment : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and light border tones and adjust the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram range . &quot;
extend the contrast : this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible range and a re@@ ji@@ usti@@ cation of all values in between . this is only visible in balanced images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo .
&quot; the white balance correction is somewhat limited because a color space with 8 bits per color is worked . if you can do the white balance in raw mode , which works in 16 bit mode , then your possibilities for correction will be better . &quot;
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by the copyright of Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym .
&quot; the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left side , both the original image and the preview of the target picture can be seen . &quot;
the preview of the destination image has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
&quot; at the top right , a hist@@ ogram is shown that will change dynamically as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well @-@ lit images , most pixels are very small lumin@@ ance values . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on shadows , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow alignment allows you to enhance or download the shadow details of your photos . &quot;
&quot; to play with the above checks , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the color temperature of the white balance . in this way the temperature and green values are automatically set . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of preferences . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. You will get the combined result in the white balance . this is displayed in preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
&quot; the Save as and Lo@@ ad buttons make exactly this . each setting of the white balance that you have set , you can save it to a text file and load it later . &quot;
&quot; the Pre@@ ferences button puts all filter values back to their default values and the relative neutral white balance . note that even neutral settings will result in a different photo than your original . if you save them , your original image will be changed . &quot;
&quot; this coding requires more disk space , computing time , and is only available for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and D@@ NG . &quot;
this tool opens the same dialog as to the editing of color profiles . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color mapping can be performed by the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed instructions for using color profiles can be consul@@ ted in the chapter of color management .
&quot; another important tool is to find sound gra@@ ding in the menu . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time , so that you always need the same error and you always need the same correction . in the manual for sound evaluation you will find more information . &quot;
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you will find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; colour effects , a solar factor effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a can@@ ten@@ et filter are available . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect that was created when printing a partially developed pressure with a short flash light and then inver@@ ted the design of the picture . the result was a partial negative image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine . &quot;
&quot; the intensity controls the solar system . at approx . 50 % intensity , the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . &quot;
this is an example of the solar process effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and this process works ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation by having a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing .
the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Media aqu@@ ot ; and therefore a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors for natural photographers . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly saturated colors are also a number of phot@@ ograph@@ s .
&quot; the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on light . for large images , the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment . &quot;
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not un@@ common that you want to correct the color contrast and brightness of the photos . you can experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . all your settings can be viewed in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result use the button OK and you will be applied .
&quot; in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation rather than increase it . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k . &quot;
&quot; between the complex tool Gra@@ dation and the simple den@@ im thickness / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool ton@@ ality correction is based on the improvement of exposure . even if the dialog to this tool works very complicated , you only need the area of the slider for the application intended here . concrete the three slide below the hist@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph there are three slider that can be cli@@ cked into it and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to learn the operation is to move the control knob , and take care of how the image changes . &quot;
&quot; the original and preview of the picture can be viewed on the right . the preview will be updated dynamically , based on the image settings . on the left side , the following options are available . &quot;
sc@@ aling : with this selection box it is possible to adjust the hist@@ ogram with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single column . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic classification is more useful .
&quot; three controls : the top one for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle sounds , often called g@@ amma @-@ values . &quot;
&quot; the three color pin@@ pet@@ tes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input ratings of shadows , middle and light tones . in addition , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment . &quot;
output values : the output ratings enable the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output value inter@@ actively as in the input values . the compression of output values can e.g. be used to create a hidden image as background while something else is seen in the foreground .
&quot; automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image . &quot;
&quot; save as and load : with these buttons , the set values can be saved in the file system and loaded later . to do so , the Gim@@ p Levels format is used . &quot;
&quot; if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette , the input value is automatically adjusted for all shadows , means and sun tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the application values for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels . &quot;
&quot; the Over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result . &quot;
&quot; below you see an example of the adjustment of the input applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left hand side , half of the original and the target picture will be displayed . the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings . on the right side , the following options are available : &quot;
modified Channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel to be changed by the module :
&quot; in addition to this box , there are two icons to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for images taken with a digital camera , linear mode is the most useful . in this case , the linear mode generates a wide beam . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode helps . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you move a short wedge to the right , e.g. the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones correspond with darker for@@ ks and that the corresponding pixel pixels are darker . &quot;
&quot; on the preview of the original photos is a red marker to see . if you shift this marker to the area you want to change , a matching line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value . create a point on this line and move it on and off until the value is adjusted according to your taste . &quot;
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . each curve that you created can be saved in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
&quot; select the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve . &quot;
&quot; the Over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels are found , you get the combined result displayed . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo that was corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel bl@@ ender of &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photos .
the channel mixer is another sophisticated tool to mix the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu color channel mixer of the image processing .
&quot; with the channel selection box , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication of how you can correct the channels by showing the relative distribution and rash . the left area of the window shows you a preview . &quot;
&quot; the preview of the target picture has a red marker . if you position it in the picture , a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to show you the corresponding colour value . &quot;
&quot; the controls for the module are on the right : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you enable lumin@@ ance , the image will also retain the general brightness as the channel mixer is then THE tool to generate great black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the color . if that is the case , you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion by reducing the color space first . &quot;
&quot; save as and load buttons are used for this purpose . you can save any mixer setup for later , then load . the file format used is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format . &quot;
&quot; the Over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been read@@ ju@@ sted . the L@@ umin@@ anz option is enabled . the original image is shown under ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography black / white is a work step since color images can easily be converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles .

&quot; green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film light with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scene pictures and fits especially well to portraits against the sky . thus similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter . &quot;
&quot; orange filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film direction with an orange l@@ enti@@ l filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . so similar to the 00@@ 2 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange filter . &quot;
&quot; red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film light with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simulate lun@@ ar scenes at day@@ time . thus , similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Red filter . &quot;
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film light with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ aton : produces warm bright and middle tones while it adds a bit of cold in the saddle tones . this is very similar to the process of leaving a pressure and the re@@ development in a s@@ epi@@ at@@ oner . this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) s@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
&quot; with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; applying mold texture , you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture . &quot;
&quot; by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can look like an oil painting on a screen , the sting of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall . &quot;
relief : post@@ p@@ one this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper tex@@ tures effect has been applied to the photo below . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) to see . the relief is set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool frame can be added a decorative frame around a picture .
keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . one way to keep his attention is to put the picture a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye .
&quot; type : with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your picture . continuously surrounded the picture with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce outline it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white pictures ) . &quot;
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the range of value for width is from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; the target picture decorated with the frame will be bigger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool After aspect ratio before cutting . &quot;
&quot; with this handy tool , you can paste plain text into an image in any place . this can also be done in multiple places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply type the text and place it with the mouse . the bigger the image , the bigger the character set must be . finally , simply select a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ transparent background . &quot;
&quot; each setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; on the button . once the image has been saved , the text is part of the picture . it can no longer be changed . &quot;
with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; apply mould sten@@ cil you can place a template over a picture .
the menu Picture Tem@@ plate apply in image editing can be used to create templates over a picture .
&quot; for the template there are no limitations regarding the size and orientation . however , you need to use the P@@ NG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to reduce the file size of the template . &quot;
&quot; if you are using this tool for the first time , you need to set your sten@@ cil folder with the basic folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you copied the template files . these settings will be noted for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after the root folder is set for the sten@@ cils , a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the template folder . selecting an folder automatically updates the thumb@@ nail of the templates automatically . &quot;
below the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the underlying image . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; smaller : this button reduces the image below . it is centered around the mouse position . if you want to apply the template to the entire image , you must reduce the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
post@@ p@@ one : use this button to move the image below the template . take the picture and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be adapted automatically to the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each one of you has advantages in other areas .
&quot; sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and simple , but it produces , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images . &quot;
&quot; blur@@ red mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture shar@@ per . in fact , it sharp@@ ens no bit , it is more psych@@ otrop@@ u@@ al . you can use it to remove atmospheric vap@@ our and it makes a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is copyright protected by Win@@ ston Ch@@ ang . &quot;
&quot; re@@ focusing is probably the best of the three , as it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has various parameters for adaptation . &quot;
&quot; photos without focus as well as most digit@@ alized images need a correction of sharp@@ ness . this is because the digi@@ tization process needs to be combined with only minimal differences to a color point . this in turn leads to sharp edges a bit blur@@ red . SL@@ R cameras usually require more retro@@ grade sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users . &quot;
&quot; images in raw format , on the other hand , must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing . &quot;
&quot; some sc@@ anners apply a field of focus while reading the image . if you de@@ activate it , you will get the control over your image . &quot;
&quot; in some situations , you can get useful results by focusing a photo with the sharpen@@ ing tool . you can use the menu entry to call for correc@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; however , the sharp@@ est technique to shar@@ pen the tool sharp@@ ens the sharp@@ ness of the edges . in general , the most useful technique to shar@@ pen one image is to re@@ focus the tool . under re@@ focusing you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpen@@ ing . &quot;
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the image slightly sof@@ tly is much easier than it is to shar@@ pen . use the tool to sof@@ ten soft marks and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ sharp masks is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should be tried first . an increase in the radius or the amount ampli@@ fies the effect . if you make the blur@@ red mask too strong , the noise and the impression of gr@@ en@@ ades close to sharp edges will create . &quot;
&quot; the radius determines how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . therefore , you should preferably shar@@ pen images in their final resolution . &quot;
&quot; the amount divi@@ des the percentage between the original and the blur@@ red image , which is added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set . &quot;
&quot; the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference in difference . thus , a minimum difference can be defined for an edge of the filter . thus , areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from sharpen@@ ing and therefore beauty errors in faces , skies and water surfaces are avoided . &quot;
&quot; the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the processed image is the ( 2 ) . blur@@ red mas@@ king was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool re@@ focusing recre@@ ates a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copyright protected Ent@@ f@@ aging Filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Viennese filtering . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is the use of a blur@@ red mask . you can start it from the menu by re@@ focusing colors in image editing .
&quot; the G@@ auss &apos;s folding has a very long tail , which results in the mathematical result even from the source pixels , which are far from the original source pixels . &quot;
&quot; circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most pictures , the default value should be 1 good results . &quot;
&quot; correlation : an increase in the correlation can help reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0.5 and the values near 1 , &amp; eg ; 0,@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high correlation reduces the sharp@@ ening effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; noise filter : an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , the image quality is 0.@@ 03 . &quot;
&quot; gauge the sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the gauge &apos; sharp@@ ness . use this parameter when your bl@@ ur is &apos; sch &apos; . in most cases , you should set this value to 0 to avoid annoying art@@ ef@@ acts . if you use a value un@@ equal to zero , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter . &quot;
&quot; matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in matrix size can produce good results , especially if you select great values for the circular edge or the gauge &apos; sharp@@ ness . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
&quot; the storage as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameters you have set will be saved for later , and can then be loaded . &quot;
&quot; try to perform all blan@@ ks , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the image before using the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible , but leave in@@ convenient art@@ ef@@ acts later . &quot;
&quot; if you read and comp@@ ress images , eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image . &quot;
&quot; generally , un@@ sharp masks produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by the un@@ sharp mask of a larger neighborhood used as sharpen@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; theore@@ tically , un@@ sharp masks always have to produce art@@ ef@@ acts . even under optimal conditions , it is never possible to remove the effect of blur@@ ring . the FI@@ R Viennese filter is always at least as good as the blur@@ red mask . the FI@@ R Viennese filter is often better when processing small details . &quot;
&quot; below you can see a comparison between different filters , on a small un@@ focused image : &quot;
this picture has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focuss@@ ed result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
&quot; for more information about the methods of sharpen@@ ing in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address . &quot;
the knob smooth@@ es the blur@@ ring of the area that has been dark@@ ened to create a more natural pup@@ il .
&quot; if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones , you can set it here . &quot;
the tool image error correction is one of the most advanced tools to remove un@@ desired arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pres@@ ets as Star@@ points to simplify the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
&quot; if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely , you can use the tab smooth@@ ing and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; detail conservation p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of details . a small value leads to uniform smooth@@ ing over the image . &quot;
&quot; directional dependence Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es evenly in all directions while a value close to 1 is smooth@@ ed in one direction . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best removed at a value near 1 . &quot;
&quot; smooth@@ es &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smooth@@ ing factor above all . p then defines the relative smooth@@ ing . therefore set this value to match the degree of noise in your image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smooth@@ ed . &quot;
repeat : speci@@ fies how often the algorithm is passed . normally 1 or 2 is sufficient .
&quot; angle step@@ wise since &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is selected small , it should also be small . make sure that small angles generate a long run@@ time . therefore , you should select this value as greatest and acceptable for your needs . &quot;
&quot; integral step width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step width in pixels . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smooth@@ ing and never larger than 2 . &quot;
&quot; linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more quality you receive by selecting this option is minimal , but it doubles the running time . therefore , we recommend it to let it out . &quot;
the Save as and Lo@@ ad buttons make exactly this . correc@@ ting errors can be saved in a text file and loaded later .
&quot; correc@@ ting image errors is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a very long time and load a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Canc@@ el button . &quot;
the module is used on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see there is a peculiar black art@@ ef@@ act in the foreground that caused by a poor film storage during the trip . the original picture is under ( 1 ) to see and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise noise . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove sta@@ ins and other art@@ ef@@ acts that occur e.g. from dust or hairs on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; -@@ effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
&quot; if you need more information on sensor scre@@ enings of digital cameras , you can read them in this tutorial . &quot;
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ iny noise that can be successfully removed using this tool .
&quot; below , you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub @-@ window details and the sub@@ window Advanced settings can remain with the default settings . &quot;
&quot; radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) used for the filter . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the focus level . this value sets the pixel gap to the front of the filter to detect lumin@@ ance changes . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or lubrication occurs again . &quot;
&quot; edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , the whole noise can &apos;t be removed or noise peaks can occur . if you want to remove a faint noise or JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts without losing details . &quot;
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend either to change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend either to change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not influence the smooth@@ ing process of the image controlled by the details .
g@@ amma : controls the Gam@@ mat@@ ol@@ er@@ dance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of darker areas which are typically more bol@@ ted .
&quot; atten@@ u@@ ation : controls the adjustment of phase j@@ itter absorption . this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius re@@ acts to variations of lumin@@ ance . if it is raised , the edges appear smo@@ other when it is too high . it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for this . &quot;
save and load : these buttons are used exactly for this . all the parameters for the reduction you set can be stored in the file system and then loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the reduction in noise was applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too crisp for your purpose . the solution to draw the image slightly sof@@ tly is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen and experiment with the smooth@@ ness . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
&quot; this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts from your images . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos; noise , film gra@@ ding , scrat@@ ches , compression art@@ ef@@ acts and local errors that occur in digital , original or retro@@ spec@@ tively digi@@ ti@@ zed images . &quot;
&quot; the same algorithm can be used for color and texture replacement . the texture statement is developed with a different tool , the image error correction . the algorithm for restoration has been developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
&quot; JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as a los@@ s@@ less compression algorithm it produces some compression &amp; quot ; art@@ ef@@ actor quot ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems . &quot;
&quot; the Save as and Lo@@ ad buttons make exactly this . every setting of photo restoration can be stored in a text file , and then loaded again . &quot;
&quot; photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take very long and a high CPU load to move . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish . &quot;
the module is applied to a black and white photo that was included with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera to an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the in@@ famous film gra@@ ding on the faces . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures have been reduced to an old color photograph that was read by a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts that were caused by the scanner illumination and the photo paper . the original image is shown under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi Project , which are copy@@ ri@@ ghted by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p . &quot;
&quot; bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high @-@ quality raw mode photos as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels . &quot;
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark image sub@@ trac@@ ting method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file into the wizard with the dark image button . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you record the dark image directly to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should download the matching dark image to the image to be corrected . &quot;
the image area and preview help you correct the result within the picture . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
select an area to see the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the available filters :
&quot; Dur@@ ing : an average of the adjacent pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line . &quot;
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 pixel are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the default fil@@ ter@@ method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel are drawn up to compu@@ te a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn up to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
&quot; below you can see the hot@@ pixel correction on a color photograph , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , applied . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture is shown below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; vi@@ gil@@ ding correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image . &quot;
&quot; wide @-@ angle lenses , especially the medium and large photo format , can often not evenly illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; vi@@ gn@@ et@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . tel@@ eph@@ oto lenses may also display this behavior . &quot;
&quot; many center filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 in the aper@@ ture filter , which increases the necessary sh@@ utter speed in such a way that it is impossible to use the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , as there are otherwise un@@ sharpen@@ ed effects caused by movement . &quot;
&quot; with the large exposure areas of today &apos;s felt and color or gray scale of digital cameras and film scanner , it is possible to simulate the effect of a Center@@ filter by applying an equivalent transformation on a rough image that was made without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ting Cor@@ rection applies the transformation with a Center@@ filter . the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker . &quot;
&quot; with three regul@@ ators , you can control the vi@@ gil@@ ding correction filter and with three further exposure of the target picture . &quot;
&quot; density : this parameter controls the level of light intensity at the point of greatest density filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which is an optical filter with aper@@ ture setting of 1 , or random@@ ly to compensate for a greater degree of vi@@ gil@@ ding , reduce it by a small degree . &quot;
&quot; brightness , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing a picture with the vi@@ gn@@ ette correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you have to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . you only have to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options , as you only have to increase the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to re @-@ adjust the exposure of the target image , leave the values for lumin@@ ance / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the color gra@@ dation menu . &quot;
this is an example of the vi@@ gn@@ ette correction applied to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gil@@ ding in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected picture . a lumin@@ ance and contrast correction was also performed with this tool .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geometric distortion . colour distor@@ tions cannot be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second graph deals with the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ x shape of the image .
&quot; the coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s at the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot;
&quot; the coefficient of fourth gra@@ des correc@@ ts the distant corners to the second degree . if you combine these two , any geometric distortion can be eliminated . &quot;
&quot; general : this value controls the strength of distortion second degree . with negative values , tone @-@ shaped distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion . &quot;
corner : this value controls the thickness of the distortion fourth degree . this value appears stronger at the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses the &apos; Corner parameter &apos; has the opposite sign of the parameter .
zoom : this value is sc@@ aled to scale the image size and thus leads to a correction of the first degree . negative values increase while positive the image decreases .
bri@@ gh@@ ten : this value adju@@ sts the brightness in the corners of the picture . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase them .
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog shows a preview the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start . &quot;
&quot; the tone and cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all blan@@ king or size changes . if you want to re @-@ cut a picture and then perform a barrel @-@ shaped correction , the effect would be apparent to the fold . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal support line . move the mouse po@@ inter in the picture preview to fix the dotted lines . &quot;
&quot; if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting picture will have black corners . you can remove them using the cro@@ pping tool in the Trans@@ figuration menu from the image editing or using the Zoom knob of this dialog . &quot;
&quot; the next logical step for some motives , such as shots from front , frame and paintings , it is the perspective to correct all angles in the picture 90 degrees . note that if you hold the camera by hand you will always have a slight distortion of perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the barrel @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the algorithm is based on a method for simul@@ ating infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website which is available under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ inf@@ ra @-@ film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can look at the effect on different parts of the picture . &quot;
&quot; below the preview , you can set two parameters setting film gra@@ ding and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . enable the Add Fo@@ g Movie Settings if you want to simulate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO control changes the amount of film gra@@ ding and the domin@@ ance of the color Green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) . green meadows are white like snow ! &quot;
&quot; since the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the color information is missing . &quot;
this is an example of the inf@@ ra @-@ red filter applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the processed image under ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a kind of aura in the top lights .
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter film gra@@ ding is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film gra@@ ding on your pictures . this is known from classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . in order to increase the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturers mix big silver grains of the photo emul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; the film gra@@ bbing effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated image gets a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life . if you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gran@@ ular sight especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you have to use this filter . &quot;
&quot; the controller can calibr@@ ate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although frequently higher values are required , to ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need more grains , you can use the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the film gra@@ ined effect applied to a black / white image . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the applied film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ pack ; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . nature pictures and still life are good for this effect .
&quot; the upper sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thi@@ cker brushes are better suited for large images . smooth@@ es control the smooth@@ ness or , from the other side , the sharp@@ ness . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original picture is marked with the ( 1 ) and the editor is marked with ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel size is 1 and smooth@@ ed 17 .
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter char@@ coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a coal mine . the lines that outline the outline in the drawing are emphasized . images whose gra@@ dients are slowly changing are not ideal for this effect . &quot;
&quot; there are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 , to control this effect . the upper controller sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower knob adju@@ sts the contrast ( smooth@@ ing ) . &quot;
this is an example of the char@@ coal @-@ recording filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter engraving shapes your picture in 3 @-@ D , as if it was stamped in wax . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter engraving is a quick tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well in pictures with a simple structure , where color is not the most important thing in the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey , mon@@ strous landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows setting the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distor@@ ting effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : spl@@ its the image into cells and makes it look as if it is seen by glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : similar to the shaft blocks 1 the picture is distorted with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects anytime with the button Finish .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blur@@ ring effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&quot; zoom Un@@ sharp@@ ness : blur@@ red the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from one focal point . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring a zo@@ oming camera , thereby creating a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography . &quot;
radi@@ al blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the picture by turning the pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
distance blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image to produce the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to step back into the background .
&quot; blur@@ ring : blur@@ ring the image through horizontal moti@@ ons of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photograph@@ ing , camera . &quot;
sof@@ tening blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the picture sof@@ tly in the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow . &quot;
sharp@@ ness : blur@@ ring the image through random shift of pixels and simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of an arbitrary moving camera .
intelligent blur@@ ring : finds the color bas@@ ins in the picture and blur@@ red them without changing the rest .
&quot; mos@@ aic : spl@@ its the photo into rectangular cells and then recre@@ ates it by filling with an average pixel value , new . &quot;
&quot; some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel this calculation at any time using the button Finish . &quot;
&quot; rain@@ drops are a nice little tool to make rain@@ drops to your picture . by doing so , it gives your images a wet look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm . &quot;
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of drops . since the drop@@ let size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images .
&quot; you can stick with the &amp; digi@@ pack ; image editing area free of rain@@ drops . use the selection tool to choose the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you start the filter rain@@ drops then the area will remain free from rain@@ drops . &quot;
this is an example of the drop @-@ drop filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
&quot; if the picture has the wrong orientation , you can put it in the right direction by mirrors or rotating . &quot;
photo blowing is definitely one of the most advanced tools to increase a photo with minimal loss of image quality .
how can you zoom or guess the missing information ? how can you get the missing information again or guess ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm used here makes a good job here . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select Trans@@ form size change in the menu and specify the target values . the dialog box is shown below .
&quot; change the tool to size using a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approach the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality , then try the tool for blowing . &quot;
&quot; many image processing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation for enlar@@ ging an image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo blowing was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
you must tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the New Size tab and are listed below :
&quot; maintain aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the new size will retain the aspect ratio of the original image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smooth@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the Save as and Lo@@ ad buttons are used precisely for this purpose . as a text file , each installation can be saved as a text file and then loaded again later . &quot;
&quot; photo @-@ blowing is very fast with what it does , but it can last very long and pull a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish . &quot;
you can see below an example for photo blowing by magni@@ fying a small color image to double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard enlargement .
&quot; the editing of a photo is not only a frequently carried out operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to put together a picture . to cut a photo you just have to create a rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and pulling the rect@@ angle , you will then see this rect@@ angle while you move the mouse . &quot;
&quot; when you release the mouse button again , the area of the photo will be cut out . this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look like after cutting . you can drag the size of the area to be cut by dra@@ gging at the corners of the rect@@ angle . you can create a new rect@@ angle by simply dra@@ gging it with the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the cutting , use the C@@ tr@@ l ; + X button in the tool bar and the photo is cut to size ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries file Save or File Save as in the File menu to save the newly @-@ cut photo . &quot;
&quot; in the preview area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you have defined in the dialog remains intact . &quot;
&quot; in the tool After aspect ratio , you can specify orientation as portrait or landscape format . in portrait format , the larger value of the height and the cross @-@ format of the width is always assigned . &quot;
&quot; the tool After aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same , regardless of whether you use centimet@@ ers , inches or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; at the right end of the dialog , there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizont@@ ally or vertically . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog below , you can set the range for cutting to the greatest possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation . &quot;
&quot; the tool After aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation ( Horiz@@ on@@ tal or Ver@@ tical ) . if you use the editing tool the next time , these settings are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data will reflect the projected image and not the original image . &quot;
the settings of the co@@ iling help make it possible to hide help so that you can put your pictures together better . these help are :
&quot; harmonic parti@@ tions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third el@@ bows , harmonious tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide a rect@@ angle in similar harmonic tri@@ angles at the diag@@ on@@ als . &quot;
&quot; golden middle : the golden middle is a division that is based on different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the flower leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful . &quot;
&quot; the golden division is the irr@@ ational number 1.@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks , who used to create your temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden divide at all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number deri@@ ves from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . &quot;
the golden center provides more fluid relief lines if you put together an image . these aids are listed below :
&quot; the golden spiral will bring you good results for your photos . compared to third el@@ re@@ ins , the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition takes the gaze of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual stream on this way . &quot;
&quot; another rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . these rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to create the golden spiral . this can be a line or different objects . &quot;
&quot; the Golden Tri@@ angles are also derived from the golden spiral . their verti@@ ces are the central points of the sides of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are no equal tri@@ angles . diag@@ onal to these lines can make a static object more dynamic . &quot;
&quot; if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your picture focus at one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . &quot;
the options Horiz@@ on@@ tal are mirr@@ ored and vertical mirrors can be used to reflect the harmonic divisions .
&quot; with the Color button , you can set the color of the guides . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the guides can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image . &quot;
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate a picture at any angle .
&quot; if you make a photo , it is easy that you don &apos;t hold the camera vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture where things are rot@@ ated around an angle . you can fix this with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image editing and tool free rotation . select Trans@@ form Free Rotation and adjust the target angle . &quot;
rotate your image with the slider angle . the values on this slider are indicated in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences button you can set the slider to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture are shown at the top right .
&quot; for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse po@@ inter to position the two lines . after moving it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section . &quot;
&quot; after turning a picture , you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . &quot;
an elegant way to cut the image is the Automati@@ cally cutting function . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the picture a bit after the rotation . note the above warning .
all perspective transform@@ ations are performed by a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then automatically be rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you to change the perspective :
&quot; new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
angle to the left : shows the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area .
angle to the left : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; after adjusting the perspective , the image becomes a bit s@@ me@@ ared . for a single adjustment this effect is small but two adjustments generate a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after you have adjusted the perspective , you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes at the corners . a way to clean this is to cut the picture with transformation cutting from the image processing . &quot;
&quot; a horizontal she@@ eting for example will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left . in other words , a rect@@ angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module about transforming sciss@@ ors . &quot;
rotate your image by using the Horiz@@ on@@ tal angle and vertical angle . you can rotate horizont@@ ally and vertically at the same time . if you press pres@@ ets the angle will be reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target picture are displayed on the right of the preview area .
&quot; move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the shooting tool to adjust your image . &quot;
&quot; after you have carried out the she@@ ar , the picture is blur@@ red . for a single loop this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two form@@ ulations are twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after sh@@ ear@@ ing , the picture has tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate this is to cut the picture with transformation cutting from the image processing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats therefore depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries are compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; because of this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on your system . however , you will always find JPEG and TI@@ FF below . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; displays only files in formats that you know . this happens by file extension and a comparison of these with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , &amp; digi@@ kam is displayed . you can change this list of file extensions that &amp; digi@@ kam . in the Con@@ figuration section , you will find more information . &quot;
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras allow you to find the format to be used .
&quot; image compression is the application of data compression techniques on digital images . redundant information is reduced , so that image data can be stored in a more efficient way . &quot;
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general there are better and smo@@ other results than JPEG in the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s version can also save losses if this is specified in the settings .
&quot; if you want to learn more about the raw image format , you can read from Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can convert raw format pictures in JPEG or TI@@ FF with the raw image converter from &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports the loading of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w which is included in &amp; digi@@ kam . all support cameras can be seen at the bottom of the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats supported by &amp; digi@@ kam ; supported :
&quot; many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often stored in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ kam , but is not a film editing program and therefore has no built @-@ in features to display films . &amp; digi@@ kam ; the &amp; k@@ de ; settings to play movies use to launch the program for playback . &quot;

&quot; if you change steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initial contrast was already very good , then you can perform the first four alignment with the module White Balance . &quot;
many tools you need to do the photo editing are included in &amp; digi@@ kam ; their description will follow here .
&quot; all image processing tools such as sharpen@@ ing , soft marks , noise suppression , re@@ focusing , mas@@ king , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog box that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below , you will see &amp; quot ; texture user quot ; in this dialog : &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : this progress bar displays the status of the filter to the current picture . to the left of it , five buttons allow to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are : &quot;
the left section shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview area .
horizont@@ ally divide without dup@@ licate . the top area shows the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
the left section shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
&quot; horizont@@ ally divide . the upper section shows the original , and the lower part shows the effect of the filter . &quot;
&quot; mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the preview area , otherwise the original . &quot;
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn on to display over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame for selecting the preview . you can drag this box with the mouse within the image and place it on the part of the image from which you want to preview the preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module will be noted .
the page bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo features : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo . this data comes from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
&quot; this tab provides an intuitive Explorer search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini @-@ program . you can press the mouse wheel in or out or move it and move it . move it while you click the left mouse button . move it while you click the left mouse button . all images inside these coordinates are filtered and displayed . of course , this pres@@ upp@@ oses that your images contain ge@@ o data . &quot;
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and to select and nam@@ ing colors .
&quot; the pallets files , which are installed by &amp; k@@ de , can either apply to the entire system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your Personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user defined color and last used colors . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog box , you can select from a list of installed pallets or search the folders according to files . &quot;
the cur@@ sor is displayed as a line in the pallet view . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it shows the color next to it . the color is described under the palette view . here the color name can also be changed .
&quot; to create such a selection , click the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor over there . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the check box Bei@@ m C@@ ursor is added under the button color , the color is inserted from the color panel at the cur@@ sor . the color is inserted either or over@@ rides another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ writing is selected . &quot;
&quot; a selection , which was created as described in the last section , can be used along with the actions copying , cutting and past@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the proportions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line @-@ end character , if another color follows . if there are three figures in the cli@@ p@@ board , these can be past@@ ed as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; inserted . &quot;
the colors in the palette and the output of the color selection can be moved with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find it in the color selection on the left .
&quot; graph@@ s are used in science , especially in computer science , and so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graph@@ s . so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graph@@ s . the programs that &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z included are according to the program author outdated &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; -@@ programs with just a few functions . &quot;
&quot; the graphic viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern , user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; c@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ dot ; -@@ dot ; -@@ programs are free layout programs . &amp; co@@ graph@@ viewer ; displays graph@@ s with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern , user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions : &quot;
integration in &amp; Poster ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of the graph in &amp; kate ; the graph re@@ comp@@ utes and in &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; represents )
menu to open the graph in &amp; kate ; open or open the graph in &amp; c@@ graph@@ viewer ; in a &amp; Poster ; -@@ component to open
loading large graph@@ s ( currently there are problems from about 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to represent more than these no@@ des )
&quot; further required software : &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that requires the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; for representation of graph@@ s , required in detail : &quot;
&quot; the main window displays the opened graph@@ s , each in a separate sub @-@ window . initially , if you &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; without an argument , the main window is empty as in the bottom screen shot . in this case , the tool@@ bar contains only the icon file and the ( empty ) list finally contains open files . click the first icon to open the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected one or more &amp; dot files , the main window looks like in the bottom screen shot : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the contex@@ tual menu or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special buttons , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt ; -@@ key ) ; &quot;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
&quot; if the currently loaded in &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; loaded file has been changed from another program , the following window will appear : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the graph should be rel@@ o@@ aded or if you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cs@@ viewer ; can also mem@@ ori@@ ze your decision , so that later will proceed as well . if you want to change your decision later , you can set up the menu item preferences k@@ graph viewer ; see also . &quot;
&quot; when you open a graph@@ ite file outside a running &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; open , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or on the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; or want to display the graph@@ ene in a sub @-@ window of the already running instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but can also change it with the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; at the start of the program , you can re @-@ open all the graph@@ s of your last session . again , you can save your choice and change it later . &quot;
you can also specify how the graph should be split to multiple pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be freely chosen .
&quot; if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to a page should be fitted to this page . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out by the respective sections of the graph . &quot;
&quot; page preview with a graph divided on several pages , without header and with a different font &quot;
&quot; the Renew@@ ed Store page gives the possibility to set the behavior when a file has been changed to the hard drive , eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically re@@ charge or ignore the changes ) or let the program ask for each time . &quot;
you can set a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that each time is asked .
the session management page gives the possibility to set the start behavior of &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cs@@ viewer ; you can set a default behavior ( open the files of the last session or not ) or decide to be asked at any start afterwards .
&quot; the context menu , which usually appears at a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ s , opens up more possibilities : &quot;
&quot; here you can choose from various &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries , as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z , are : &quot;
&quot; the algorithm lays the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) , and then tries to produce as short edges as possible as possible . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for ung@@ rated graph@@ s . it produces representations according to the spring@@ board model . in this process , the Kam@@ ada Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is equivalent with statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm creates a spring@@ board model for ung@@ eri@@ fied graph@@ s . it uses the Fru@@ it@@ man Rein@@ gold He@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ wire trigger for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graph@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm arran@@ ges the k@@ not circle @-@ shaped according to the description of Six und Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures . &quot;

the K@@ IP@@ I module provides tools to read new images and save them .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently two sources can be used :
scan images : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner that supports the San@@ e project or another source such as Video Stre@@ ams . to do this you need to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
&quot; when you scan the menu entry , a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to fetch the image . you can also set the default source for the next time . &quot;
&quot; after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears by selecting the default duc@@ r@@ he default values to select your image accordingly . see the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you scan the image . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , lower corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information . &quot;
&quot; make sure that the window is completely displayed , as some settings may not be displayed otherwise . &quot;
after you have pressed the button Scan you need to wait until the scan is completed and the window to set the options of the target picture appears . please remember that the type BM@@ P will not be compressed and therefore very large files . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image .
screen shots can be created after you have selected the Import &gt; screen shot in the Import menu . a window appears in which you can set the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ des :
select the entire desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
&quot; if all of your own program window is selected , the calling program will disappear so that you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible workplace . &quot;
&quot; the delay determines how long screen@@ shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other working surfaces , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate . &quot;
&quot; after the screen@@ shot has been made , the dialogue options of the target picture will appear with the options described above . &quot;

Fli@@ ck@@ r is an online photo management on the Internet . Fli@@ ck@@ r makes it possible to send pictures to people who are important . you can show your favorite photos of the world online and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and family all over the world .
Fli@@ ck@@ r module can be used to upload images from your computer to a Fli@@ ck@@ r server on the Internet .
&quot; if you use the module for the first time , you are guided through the process of generating a token . this is used for your authentication . it is thus virtually your ID to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser is started so that you can log in to Fli@@ ck@@ r . &quot;
&quot; after successful registration , the module can send photos to the Fli@@ ck@@ r website . the following page will be presented to you after a successful login . &quot;
&quot; simply close the browser window and return to the program . after pressing Yes , you get the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section . &quot;
&quot; when the module ex@@ porting to Fli@@ ck@@ r for the second time , you will be greeted with the following dialog , which displays the current access per@@ missions that the module displays . you will also need write per@@ missions . you will be asked if you want to proceed with these per@@ missions . &quot;
this button lets you select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . if you click on the O@@ k button starts the upload of the photos to the Fli@@ ck@@ r server .
the keywords field can be filled with a comm@@ a separated list of words . these are added to the image as keywords during upload .
&quot; with the options Open , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ lie you can set the per@@ missions on your pictures . by default , the photos are classified as private . &quot;
&quot; if you choose to change the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos will be changed before up@@ loading in size . the size is taken from the value registered at maximum size . &quot;
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Gallery Export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for Galerie Export currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographic data is stored in the EX@@ IF keywords of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization provides tools to loc@@ alise images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the sp@@ her@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , long@@ itude and l@@ ati@@ tude are used . &quot;
to cor@@ relate your images with geographic data you need a GPS track as XML file in g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ ps@@ you can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization cor@@ relations . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . the above @-@ looking dialog appears then . to create a possible correlation between time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file with GP@@ X file . &quot;
&quot; when the file is loaded , an automatic correlation is performed which indicates the coordinates in red . GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT . this can be done with time zone . &quot;
&quot; the setting for maximum time devi@@ ation gives an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera time . if the devi@@ ation is below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2,000 seconds . &quot;
if you do not have trace data from one location for pictures you can manually edit the g@@ p@@ x file and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will cor@@ relate all the images in this area .
&quot; the options Inter@@ pol@@ eren and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have matching data . if you know that in reality there is a location in a large time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ related to inter@@ pol@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful when you have made a number of photos in the same place . as the dialog coordinates the coordinates from one call to the next , you only need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the location can also be found and set up with the displayed map . select the region in question and enlarge it again and again until you have reached an adequate accuracy . the height must always be manually selected . the card can be changed between map mode , satellite image and a mixed mode . &quot;
&quot; completely out of the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that uses the exi@@ ft@@ ool to provide a stack of pictures with GPS data . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module image gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded U@@ TF @-@ 8 to enable the best internation@@ alization possible .
&quot; the tab has four tab@@ s in which the settings can be adjusted . you only need to select those albums which are to be exported to HTML . the albums are not shown hierarch@@ ically . in the section below , the Al@@ ben@@ cht@@ schau and the text that appear in the header of the HTML page will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; this tab displays the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . if you click on a picture , a new page will be opened in which the image is displayed . otherwise the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show , &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ der Album defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be stored with all your associated images . select a folder on which you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export , which contains everything , will be created there . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original pictures will also be stored in the new images . &quot;
&quot; with other color depth , you can change the default color depth . of course , it also influences the file size . all other settings are self explan@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; the thumb@@ nails allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for thumb@@ nails , these are small images that are displayed in the gallery . &quot;
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to cancel the process .
&quot; if the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the program messages to determine if errors occurred during production . the web browser will automatically start to preview the gallery . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming , or sliding . the viewer can be used with short commands and buttons . it was designed for quick image display and quick access to its functions . &quot;
&quot; after the start , a picture is displayed by default in full screen mode . this can be changed into a window mode . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ free module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality .
&quot; this module allows for the actions listed below to save images in JPEG format , without the usual loss of quality or metadata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of los@@ s@@ less storage is it that increases the file size , since no compression of the color information takes place . this can also be found at the P@@ NG format . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool to connect your computer to a digital camera .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org mailing list for the K@@ IP@@ I team .
&quot; with the import function of the metadata module you can copy data from one image to another . then , select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then go to the import function . &quot;
&quot; this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but do not write in any target format . JPEG is supported while writing . please look at exi@@ v2 to see which formats are supported . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
&quot; the module MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer can be used to convert selected images into an MPEG video , with a defined length , to convert this module . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slide show . &quot;
&quot; all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . in addition , you can create a background color for the video format . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program . &quot;
you must first select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG slide . then you can start using Extras MPEG slide show to start the module .
&quot; the images you have selected are then listed under image files in the portfolio , where you can also change sorting of the images or the contents of the list . &quot;
&quot; after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . PAL is pre @-@ set and most likely the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should indicate the time in seconds that displays an image . the speed of the picture transition is specified below . a low value creates very sudden , a high , very smooth image change . &quot;
&quot; the background color can be set next . in case of doubt , you should leave it black . you can specify the name and path of the generated file under the name of the MPEG output file . &quot;
&quot; if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adapted all settings to your wishes , you can start the creation of the movie with the button Ko@@ di . depending on the speed of your computer you can now enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slide show if you are back . &quot;
&quot; if a note appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck packages via the button settings below . &quot;
the print wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is for example : useful to improve or print using the Gim@@ p module .
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import or convert your images stored in RA@@ W format into one of three formats JPEG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM . &quot;
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from him is : do not expect from d@@ cra@@ w that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w ! .
&quot; first , select the RA@@ W file that should be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter Window then appears in mode for a single image . with the Pre@@ view button , you can view the effect of your current settings on the image . &quot;
&quot; you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for the white balance . the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later . &quot;
a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode the R@@ G@@ BG switch has no effect .
&quot; once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . JPEG uses a los@@ s@@ less algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes . &quot;
&quot; tagged Image Format , TI@@ FF , keeps all information about your image and uses los@@ s@@ less LZ@@ W compression . &quot;
if you plan to edit your images frequently or later use it otherwise you should not choose JPEG format because it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deterior@@ ates . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
&quot; if you select JPEG as a storage format , the metadata contained in the RA@@ W file will be stored in the JPEG file in the Ex@@ if information . &quot;
&quot; if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion with the Exec@@ ute button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; batch processing mode allows you to convert various images at once . therefore , use this mode if you are certain , e.g. by testing on a single image which is the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , they have the option to over@@ write existing files automatically . this is helpful in case they have been created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . &quot;
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in one album . it uses the program convert from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , number and tim@@ est@@ amp of the album . &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package .
&quot; proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in one dimension . the width or height of the image is automatically selected , depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . &quot;
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen size .
not proportional : no proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed in this option .
&quot; pre @-@ press : prepare the image for the photo print . the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target picture , including background size , edge size and background color , is adjusted accordingly . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your favorite email program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before .
&quot; once you have started the module , the images window will be displayed with the images you have previously selected . you can add more images using a file selection dialog . for the last selected image , a preview on the right @-@ hand side will be displayed . &quot;
you can also drag pictures to the picture list and place them in order to add them to the list of pictures to be sent .
&quot; with the button images , the selected pictures will be removed from the list of pictures to be sent . &quot;
&quot; after selecting all the images , you can open the new message window of your email client using the OK button . you just have to add the addresses and the subject here . &quot;
don &apos;t make sure to send too many pictures at one time . most e @-@ mail accounts have restrictions on the size of e @-@ mails . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration will be saved and used every time you change it .
&quot; select your email client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you will need to specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after selecting comments in an attached file , the comments will be added to the images in a text file and the mail is attached . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ NG format under the Image File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to los@@ s@@ less formats such as TI@@ FF . you should therefore use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend you JPEG format . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG in JPEG format and the original files are in JPEG format , then the original copy data will be added to the images to be sent . &quot;
&quot; when the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically so that you can view the status messages , search for errors . your E @-@ mail program will automatically end up . you can simply close this window with the closing button . &quot;
&quot; after starting the module advanced slide show , a window with questions like you want your slide show appears . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album . &quot;
&quot; the Open@@ GL transitions option in the presentation will enable very elegant image transitions using Open@@ GL . however , you need to have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow . &quot;
the File Name option will show that the file name of the images will be displayed in the left bottom corner during the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in a loop loop . you can then cancel it manually with Es@@ c .
the option images random@@ ly choose the images displayed in a random order . so it is not used to order the images in the album .
&quot; between the pictures , the distance between the pictures can be set . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . so you should test it before you show your friends ! &quot;
there are more than a dozen transitional effects between which you can select . random@@ ly choose a different effect in each transition between the images .
&quot; during the slide show , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left edge of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn on . &quot;
&quot; with this tool bar , you can pause and restart the presentation , jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slide show . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the screen , you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ame , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot;

the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool for setting a picture as background image for the desktop .
&quot; this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as a background for your K@@ DE desktop . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you have added your pictures and videos with comments , you can browse through these browsers , see picture . as you can see by comparing with the picture , there are now in each group , so in people , places and in the group keywords entries . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window , you can see the categories for which you have entered information as you have provided your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations . additionally there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information to view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course to view the current preview images . &quot;
&quot; when you press the mouse on the entry , the browser view changes . see image . &quot;
&quot; if you select another person , only the images are displayed where both persons can be seen . by this selection method , you can restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand images on a few images . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected all the people , locations and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view the images of your sphere of action . &quot;
&quot; in the picture , each person has the same symbol in front of her name . you can save with &amp; photo@@ album , but for each person you can store your own preview image . this also applies to places , keywords and other categories you have defined yourself . &quot;
&quot; to view images next to the name , select the button located on the right of the tool@@ bar . in the appearing context menu , you can select which view you want to use for the current category . &quot;
&quot; however , you have to specify which image to display for each individual . in order to do this , you need to select the image view window ( described in more detail ) and select the image for each individual . in the viewing window , you can customize the picture for the corresponding person and select which portion of the image should be displayed or cut off . &quot;
&quot; if you visit the entry in the main window , you will see a dialog that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . &quot;
&quot; if you want to enter a string in the field of let@@ tering or description , you can also enter a date to search for ; the date can be either a part of the total date , i.e. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a section of two dates , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all the pictures according to certain names as you can see in the picture . here , according to pictures , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are shown . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for &amp; photo@@ album ; . if you don &apos;t like to read manuals , but rather want to try out the same features , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to the homepage of &amp; photo@@ album , and watch the quick entry , screen@@ shots and introduc@@ tory videos . &quot;
&quot; start &amp; photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog , select the demo , if you start &amp; photo@@ album ; start the first time , or select the menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ demo . then , some sample images will be loaded and you can try the features of &amp; photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you can find it on the homepage of &amp; photo@@ album ; as a coherent HTML document for downloading . &quot;
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar can be seen here : . as the name says it shows you data statistics about the pictures in your database .
&quot; you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . in the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying only 10 minutes sections . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can be inter@@ actively used in the following ways : you can change the previ@@ ew@@ ed entries from the database ( if you select a date , the first picture of this date will appear in the preview image ) and also displays the current date of the currently displayed pictures when you navigate in the preview view . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a section of the tim@@ eline by holding down the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , so the time information . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a tim@@ eline bar . &quot;
&quot; &amp; photo@@ album ; provides you two ways to create HTML websites with your images . the one is embedded in &amp; photo@@ album ; integrated and the other available as module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual , the in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album is described . &quot;
&quot; before creating HTML pages , you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas of content , layout and destination . in the following , each area is described more closely . &quot;
&quot; first , enter the title of the review and a description that should contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML example pages will see an example of these settings . &quot;
&quot; next , select whether a &amp; photo@@ album ; export file should be created on the overview page . updated information about the export files can be found in . &quot;
&quot; finally , you can choose which information to display on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid that information is displayed to the viewer even without a description . for example , that all pictures are displayed by a party . you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers . &quot;
&quot; in this area , you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are un@@ ambig@@ uous , which is why they are not specifically addressed . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images , so those who have to look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no longer download images , such as a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time you have set . therefore , you can browse your images with low resolution , which leads to a lower transfer time . if you want to get a picture larger , it changes to a higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setting , you specify the different folders and the URL where your site is stored . &quot;
&quot; for all your HTML files , select a base folder and select a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to select the main folder where all your images are stored . this folder will be saved and automatically added to the location next time . this allows you to select either a folder or a K@@ DE support protocol , for example : &quot;
&quot; once you have created your images , you can verify that these are all visible to the viewer . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser , after the pages have been created , will be started . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located . &quot;
&quot; the settings you have just described have moved all three to base folders or URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder will be created , whose name you can set in output folders . &quot;
&quot; if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; photo@@ album ; come together , you may want to create your pictures with these . you can of course add an HTML page to view the pictures . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; photo@@ album , you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . the image properties are ex@@ - and imported . &quot;
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or whether the file is only a link to images . the advantage of storing all images into the file is that you can get all the images together and share this file independently . however , the obvious disadvantage is the file size . &quot;
&quot; you can create a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the File Export ... or along with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in two ways . first , it searches the images that are in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding images are not found , then the images of the URL you have created when creating the HTML files will be searched . this is , of course , only possible if you created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog for the export of images is described which you can access via the File Export ... menu . &quot;
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . you have the following three choices :
&quot; if you want to copy manual to the .@@ k@@ im file , you will need to copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; with the option Automati@@ cally close to the .@@ k@@ im file , copy &amp; photo@@ album ; the images automatically for you . &quot;
.@@ k@@ im files are normal zip files . since most images are already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not worthwhile to comp@@ ress the files .
&quot; the last option of this page is to limit the maximum image size . if you send pictures to your friends , you might not want to send the pictures in full size , as the .@@ k@@ im file would be very large , for example , by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
&quot; if you import a file with extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File menu ... , &amp; photo@@ album will import the exported database as described in . &quot;
&quot; the wizard for import consists of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , then , in which folder the import images should be copied . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you person@@ alize the category people to the imported file ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) , while this category is in your database . therefore , you will be asked in the third dialog window , which categories should be imported to the im@@ porting file and which categories they correspond to in your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database . an example of this can be seen in the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you look at pictures of your Italian holiday and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is shown . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will find the different steps of ( 1 ) determining the information about your images , about ( 2 ) browsing and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ Album started as a program to manage your pictures . however , it has been expanded and today it takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual it is talked about images , but often this includes videos . &quot;
&quot; &amp; photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top@@ most folder of your images . this is a simple XML file , which you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a flo@@ ppy or re@@ visions in CVS , where they want . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; re@@ members the folder in which your images are stored and will automatically use it in future starts . if you want to read another database in &amp; photo@@ album , you can start &amp; photo@@ album ; with the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / Pictures / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; over the menu entry settings k@@ photo@@ album , set up ... go to a window that lets you change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual , the various settings are explained . &quot;
&quot; on the left you can see six different symbols that allow you to view settings and options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available that you can call by pressing the F1 key and one click on the option you want . &quot;
&quot; it describes how you can set different properties for each picture , e.g. persons , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups like objects , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; see the dialog used to edit already existing groups . for each existing group , you can select an inscription and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; sub @-@ categories have already been mentioned in the section . in the Options dialog , you can set up complete member groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group , instead of all groups of a member as explained in . &quot;
&quot; in the left @-@ hand side of the window , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left half of the window there is a list with the current category and in the right a list of sub @-@ categories . &quot;
&quot; &amp; photo@@ album ; shares its modular system with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this modular system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface . updated information can be found on the Ki@@ pi website . &quot;
&quot; the modules can be accessed via the Mod@@ ules menu . the modules can and will not be described in this manual , since they are not part of &amp; photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can access via the module itself . &quot;
&quot; since the modules are shared between multiple applications together , it may be that the modules with &amp; photo@@ album ; only very little tested . therefore , you should use the command line with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or over the Help menu . do not say I would not have warned you ! &quot;
the applications that use the modules using K@@ IP@@ I are very different so it can be that some modules with &amp; photo@@ album are not working . this is the disadvantage if you share functions with different applications .
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I is that the other applications can arrange their images in albums : this is an album simply a folder . even if &amp; photo@@ album ; this kind of order does not support , it simul@@ ates the order after albums so you can use the features with &amp; photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; it simul@@ ates &amp; photo@@ album ; the current album , which is simply the current view , so all the images that show you the picture preview at the moment . &quot;
next to the current album &amp; photo@@ album ; the modules also have to hand over a list of albums . here &amp; photo@@ album ; as follows :
&quot; if &amp; photo@@ album ; s Browser shows the content of a category , for example all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; so , for example , if you are using the category people , &amp; photo@@ album , so do so , so if you have selected individuals to view and share it with the module . &quot;
&quot; since some modules with &amp; photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . &quot;
&quot; on the picture , you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start &amp; photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures . &quot;
&quot; as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you will see a menu and tool@@ bar at the top . under the tool@@ bar you will see the window that you can browse your image database . &quot;
&quot; one of the main functions of &amp; photo@@ album ; is the possibility to see each picture with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons appearing on the picture , where the image has been taken . if for example , on all pictures , Jes@@ per is shown and all pictures taken in Copenhagen are included . &quot;
all these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these notes if you use the built @-@ in viewer .
&quot; you can see three lists with a text field by setting people , locations and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; photo@@ album , as you will always use them when you enter information about your images . &quot;
&quot; the following idea is to post@@ p@@ one images within the list : if you have a family celebration , for example , and on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 people can be displayed , you can , by means of the names used up , find the people faster and assign them . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the icon for sorting by date under the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected notes for each image individually , you may want to edit all the selected images and add these images with ann@@ ot@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; if you have captured several images , e.g. with the same person , it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item multiple entries at once with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the US . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California . &quot;
&quot; in the picture you see a browser window displaying the USA as a top group . to show you that it is a group , a special icon is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu of the comment dialog , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also drag an entry into a category and place it there to make it sub@@ category alphabe@@ tically . &quot;
&quot; you can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the paste that form the top edge of the frame . you can also make a separate window from a frame , by dra@@ gging it out of the window area . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted the window &apos;s look to your needs , that you are satisfied with the settings , click the Options ... , which offers you the opportunity to save the current layout and appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also hide a frame completely . if you want to get this window back later , use the Options ... and then check out the window . this procedure can be seen in the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you choose to view images in your browser , you will get an overview of thumb@@ nails of the currently selected images , or all pictures if you do not have a filter . you can configure the thumb@@ nail size by simply dra@@ gging the mouse with the middle mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is set up as background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you click on a picture , it will appear in the picture viewer . if you don &apos;t have a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created . &quot;
you can also delete images in the preview image . simply select the corresponding images you want to delete and press either the Del@@ ete key or select Edit selection in the Edit menu . now the window will display that you can see in the picture .
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can also use photos without you stored on your hard drive . of course , you must have stored the images somewhere , so that &amp; photo@@ album ; you can view the view from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required pictures can be downloaded from the hard drive . &quot;
&quot; images , where the right upper corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . however , for images 5 @-@ 9 , thumb@@ nails are present , so you can preview them . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , this feature requires you to copy files from the folders and then copy it back into . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not support it until now to ask for the inser@@ tion of the respective CD . if so , please buy a bigger hard drive to save all the pictures . &quot;
&quot; in the menu Pictures , you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name of privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , you can filter the pictures so that in the end those you may want to see for others and click on the menu item to unlock everything except the current view . &quot;
&quot; so you have set out what images should be hidden in the case of the case . if you want to give the laptop now your little sister , simply select the menu item to lock images , so that all the images that you have locked are hidden . if you want to get the images displayed again , click on lock . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to set a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select a password in the Privacy menu . &quot;
&quot; please bear in mind that this photo protection is by no means very secure . on the one hand , all images on the hard disk and on the other can remove or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . &quot;
&quot; the reason why you want to describe all your pictures with &amp; photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it is , of course , that you want to contem@@ plate them at some point . for this reason , &amp; photo@@ album ; using a picture _ and video viewer . you can start from the preview as described in . &quot;
&quot; you can see the viewer in . he naturally shows the picture , but additional all the information you have entered through the image , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if you want to see the information box on the upper part of the image you want to see , you can easily drag it with the mouse and place it somewhere else . you can also configure what information is to be displayed . all these options are available after a right @-@ click on the viewer . &quot;
&quot; some words in the Info@@ Box are under@@ lined . if you click here , the browser , see the appropriate entries for this . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all the images of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you have selected persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have downloaded several images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and after by using the keys picture up and down . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions can also be reached from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if several images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slide show . &amp; photo@@ album ; then download a new picture after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key and plus or minus . &quot;
a very useful feature of the viewer of &amp; photo@@ album ; is it possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
&quot; using the Min@@ us button , you can simply pull a rect@@ angle with the mouse . with the Min@@ us button you can zoom in the center of the picture . shows how a zoom @-@ rect@@ angle is selected and shows the outcome of the zo@@ oms . &quot;
&quot; with the button key , you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not shown zo@@ omed . with the DC key , the zo@@ oms , so that each pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image . &quot;
note that the only zoom operations that work in videos are that you are in and out zo@@ oming with the plus and minus key .
&quot; with the turn functions from the contex@@ tual menu , you can rotate the image . this does not work with videos . you can make notes to the current image with the menu item notes from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when you look at pictures it can happen that you find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture . at the moment you can preview the image and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter these names . however , you may prefer to mark only the image and see more pictures . &quot;
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the images developed on paper . to see which photos you want , you can launch the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad , while you watch one after the other . &quot;
&quot; for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to add pictures with features while you view them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by clicking the corresponding letter . in view a picture where the characters A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; you can see all the images you edit , print or whatever you choose , so you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do . &quot;
&quot; categories and especially features can be displayed in the preview screen . if you want to display categories in dre thumb@@ nail , then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image was selected . you can see this here : &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case you may be allowed to paint on the picture .
&quot; the mixture is not stored with the image , but in the database . &quot;
&quot; in order to complete the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , select View on the image from the contex@@ tual menu . to finish the painting , simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window . &quot;
&quot; to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; you need to have the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not fully profi@@ cient , but the documentation on &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you absolutely have read and understand . &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is displayed in the wire model views . &quot;
&quot; you can also select multiple objects at the same time , but not the sub@@ object of an already selected object , as all sub @-@ objects are already selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the Add @-@ in menu . &quot;
&quot; if there are multiple possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will be displayed to allow you to choose the correct position : &quot;
&quot; with Del@@ ete either from the Edit menu bar , or from the right @-@ click context menu , you can remove selected objects from the scene before . &quot;
&quot; if you have changed properties , click Apply to take these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message is displayed with an error description . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ User Docum@@ entation in the setup dialog box , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ Reference to the displayed object with Help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation . &quot;
&quot; when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can preview the property view . &quot;
&quot; press preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the chosen texture . as default , the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render a sub @-@ ranked item ( for example a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , check locally . &quot;
the screen@@ shot shows the camera &apos;s control points . you can drag the control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by dra@@ gging with the mouse within the entire window . &quot;
&quot; each object has a visibility stage as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the higher @-@ level object or as an absolute value . objects are displayed only when they are selected , or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the visibility of the scene chosen in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphic views on the right .
&quot; if you don &apos;t like the standard window fitting or if you need a different arrangement , you can set it as you like . you can also store multiple window orders and simply switch between different arrangements . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window over or below a view , go to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then displays the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , go to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to arrange several views over each other , go to the beginning water in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the map tab at the top of the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window arrangement is ho@@ vering views : views that are not anchored in the main window . in order to solve a view from anch@@ oring , drag the beginner to the desktop or click the small pointing arrow pointing left in the cham@@ fer bar . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the cham@@ fer bar . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross . &quot;
&quot; you can insert additional views into the main window . in the View menu , you will find entries for each type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them in any place . &quot;
the current window view can be saved with view window layout ... saving . it displays a dialog in which you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name .
&quot; &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . as this manual is written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; version 1.0 . &quot;
to render the current scene click on symbol Ren@@ dering The symbol rendering in the tool@@ bar or select the menu item view scene ren@@ ders .
&quot; a render mode corresponds to entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of render modes , from a quick preview up to full images in the highest quality . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the icon settings icon in the tool@@ bar , or in the View menu View menu , the following dialog will be opened : &quot;
&quot; each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it makes sense to indicate the properties of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the map size , you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the check box sub@@ section and enter the image section for rendering to the input fields . &quot;
in combination field quality you can select the properties which &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; used for rendering . this comes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ use reflection light . a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the user manual on &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
&quot; these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ é pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing . &quot;
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of these errors . generally see images with this property better .
&quot; if you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one ray per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super sampling . as standard is an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; the second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively because each pixel is split further and adap@@ tively because the recur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated values . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a ray per pixel . if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the given threshold , then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4 additional points will be calculated , at a depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : r 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then : &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are monitored separately and can be checked for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of recur@@ sion can be set with the depth value . &quot;
&quot; another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the creation of noise for the ray process called j@@ itter@@ ing . if you turn j@@ itter@@ ing , change &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
&quot; the last setting for quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; , the diff@@ use light reflection is calculated . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property . &quot;
on this map you can adjust if the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the related rays have not hit the object .
&quot; opens a new window for the display of the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; unexpectedly quit , you can find the reason here . &quot;
&quot; to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; Import , select the menu entry file import ... and select a file in the dialog box . &quot;
&quot; currently , &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; not yet the full command range of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . if error messages or warnings occur when im@@ porting error messages or warnings , a dialog window displays a list of all messages . &quot;
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
&quot; you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray . to import objects into the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree . &quot;
&quot; with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; and in your editor , you can paste source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; likewise . &quot;
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
&quot; if you click Help in the property view , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; User Docum@@ entation to the displayed object . here , set the path to your document retention and version . supports the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( e.g. height elements ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you also need to enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used . &quot;
the color for the wire models . the second color is used to display the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used to display the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type plates .
&quot; you can set the item cat@@ cher to the grid in the contex@@ tual menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time to render . for some objects such as the ball , you can set the detail step separately for two directions . &quot;
&quot; if you cross high detail fi@@ del@@ ity for extended projections , all wire @-@ model views are further divided if the camera uses an extended projection . advanced projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections . this feature gives a better approach to the projections , but requires more time to render . &quot;
&quot; if you cross wall , a wall is rendered behind the objects . the wall is displayed in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colours . &quot;
&quot; when you cross the ground , a bottom is rendered underneath the objects . the floor is displayed in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colours . &quot;
&quot; if you tick roll smooth@@ ing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used to render the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold values . &quot;
&quot; on this page , you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . in the window orders section explains how to create and store window orders . &quot;
the combination field Standard window arrangement : displays all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; uses the chosen window arrangement at the start of the program .
the list of window orders will display all existing window orders . you can create a new arrangement with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the button Rem@@ ove .
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all views of the selected window arrangement . new views can be created using the Add button and delete selected views using the button Rem@@ ove .
&quot; with New columns , create a new column on the right of the existing window , with Un@@ ten anchor the window under the existing window , with Un@@ ten anchor the window under the previous view and ho@@ vering the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you just have &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; installed and now you want to start without more precise knowledge of both programs . if you follow all steps in this tutorial , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a ball at a level . &quot;
&quot; however , you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that you only receive a black screen as a result . if you are using a 3D program for the first time , you should follow these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied for rendering , as a result you get a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you do not insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you will only get a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you have installed everything without error , you will see at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the following pre @-@ set window arrangement : &quot;
take a little time to get to know the menus and the icons of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation to get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
&quot; you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , first you have to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the Edit Del@@ ete menu . &quot;
&quot; in particular , you notice that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene . &quot;
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera will be found . &quot;
&quot; do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera in the view has control points that you can change the target point of the camera . simply click a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired location . &quot;
&quot; when you press the Apply button or button paste , change the wire model views and the object tree immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the point of view of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . for example , you might insert a header ( insert End@@ less Body Qu@@ ader ) and adjust the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method to solve this task . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; actually , offers a simpler way . you can use an infinite plane as ground : &quot;
&quot; a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the Apply or button . in the object tree , the new name is immediately displayed . &quot;
&quot; the wire model view now also displays the level , even at the moment only as a limited final layer . when you render the scene , the plane expands to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; if you look at the object tree exactly , you will find that you can fold the entry for the floor if you click on the symbol + in front of the object . in this case you will find only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . &quot;
&quot; in this scene you should move the floor to the exercise unit under the horizon line , just to get to know some of these parameters . select Shift and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but at the moment choose something simple . &quot;
&quot; in both cases , a dialog box opens in which you can select how to insert the object . please select first sub @-@ object . you can change the name in the property view ( name = bottom @-@ pigment ) , with a click on the Pre@@ view button see how the pigment now looks like . &quot;
&quot; of course , the pig@@ ments preview only shows a matt black material because you need to re @-@ enter settings for the pigment . now , remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t see any color on the header and the ball in the preview , just click the Apply button and then start the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is set correctly now . if you render your picture right now with a click on the symbol , you should get the following result : &quot;
&quot; in the color list you have to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this even more often , but the check@@ er@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , select one color each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties : &quot;
&quot; this step should already be done easily , as you should already have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the ball can be created just as easy as the floor : &quot;
&quot; in the view of the object properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( don &apos;t forget to press the Apply button or the Apply button ) , so the ball would float above the floor as you moved the floor around one unit down@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; of course , rendering now results in a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . in the next step , put a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as with the floor , give the ball a pigment as colour : &quot;
&quot; select first sub @-@ object and change the name for example in Ball Pig@@ ment . click on a sphere of pigment , then select Uni@@ coloured and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; but you can achieve more interesting effects , if you take the time to set some finish properties : &quot;
then change the values as shown in the following screen@@ shots and click Apply or press En@@ ter .
&quot; the settings shine @-@ effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrome @-@ plated surfaces , even if metal : not yet selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of what options are available to you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; hopefully , you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a render method to create a two @-@ dimensional picture of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
&quot; if you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en a scene , the ren@@ derer shoots hyp@@ othe@@ tical rays from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . &quot;
&quot; without a light source you don &apos;t see anything , the image is simply black . obviously , every scene that is to be rendered needs some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
&quot; in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c . &quot;
opens a file . in the standard file dialog you can select a file that you have previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ;
&quot; whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and disk space . &quot;
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are dis@@ car@@ ded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have not saved any saved changes in the scene .
repe@@ ats the recently revers@@ ed command . you can only select this menu entry only if you have used editing undo .
saves the current window order and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing order .
&quot; in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; here you can change the appearance , short@@ cut and default behavior . &quot;
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cuts . you can use this option to modify the short@@ cuts for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; change commands or add new ones .
open a dialog box to set up the tool@@ bar . you can add and remove tool icons for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler with this option ; add and remove commands .
a B@@ ump @-@ Map is a way to pre @-@ install rough surfaces without having to model each b@@ ump on the surface individually without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for a dump map as well as for a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geometric shapes you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic look .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis by applying an image file as color chart .
&amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is a comfortable picture viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display .
images can be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is very easy . the file browser lists files that you can display with clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ s ; or the Return key .
&quot; you can set whether each image should be displayed in a separate window , or whether all images should always use the same window . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a specific file , just type the first character of the file name in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the right lower corner . if a matching fil@@ en@@ ame is found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing return or &amp; Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog box - &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; there are five flash@@ cards . in three of them , General and editing and slide show , you can set the working method of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; set the short@@ cuts for the display window and short commands for the browser , the short@@ cuts for the respective windows can be specified . &quot;
&quot; if the image is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area will be filled with the background color , which you can set further down . default is not full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; this point activ@@ ates , loads &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; already the next image in the folder , while you still watch the current picture . this reduces the delay if you choose the next picture , and is especially suitable for a slide show . &quot;
&quot; with this option , &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; when moving the name of the last opened folder . at the next start &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; this folder in the browser window . &quot;
&quot; click on the colored bar to select a background color . it is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if the window is larger than the picture , the background is filled with the selected color . &quot;
&quot; you can &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; set up that only some of the file types can be displayed , which can also display the program . &quot;
&quot; with this option , the display window is enlarged to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default . &quot;
determine if the slideshow is to start with the first image in the folder or the selected image .
&quot; to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the slider or small arrows to the right next to the input field . default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; if this value is set to 0 , the slide show will be repeated until it is abor@@ ted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the slider to the right next to the input field . default is 1 . &quot;
&quot; here , change the short@@ cuts for the various modes of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards short instructions for the display window and short commands for the browser . &quot;
&quot; with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window . &quot;
displays great icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays preview images for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
reduces the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the picture .
closes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is also closed when no browser window is opened anymore .
display the image in original size . this is only useful when automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
&quot; opens the input field for the completion . enter the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected . &quot;
&amp; show photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo editing based on &amp; digi@@ kam ; image editing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of &amp; digi@@ kam ; project .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a fast image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
&quot; like the rest of &amp; k@@ de , is &amp; show@@ photo ; an open source project . this means it depends on the user to contribute to at least problems and possible improvements . &quot;
&quot; this displays a dialog with a link . if you are using it , your browser will open a page to report problems and wishes . this displays a dialog with a link . if you use it , your browser will open a page to report problems and wishes . all required information is already completed and you can simply follow the instructions to submit your message . &quot;
&quot; &amp; show@@ photo ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers can help each other . if you are a common user of &amp; show photo ; if you are a common user of &amp; show photo ; in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language . &quot;
&quot; the best start to participate in &amp; show photo ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list to join . instructions to join the developer mailing list &amp; show@@ photo ; . &quot;
&quot; &amp; show@@ photo ; try to give you so much control over its work@@ flows as possible . in order to access these settings , you need to select the Settings menu photo ; set it up . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons on the left . &quot;
&quot; in exposure indicators , you can select the color that is displayed when the sub@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . &quot;
&quot; the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; has a side bar at the right edge , which provides you with important information and actions on the selected images . you can also view them in the image editing . you can view them by clicking on one of the five riders : &quot;
&amp; sc@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for scanning images that no longer makes them scan and save images .
&quot; &amp; sc@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application for scanning images that no longer works as images to scan and save images . for each image , open a dialog to save or save the images in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . &quot;
you can check the status of your scanner support on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the necessary information on this site : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
&quot; a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sc@@ l@@ ite ; with the command sc@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner cannot be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog to select the scanner is opened . &quot;
the user can select the scanner to be used and press OK to open the scanner . cancel &amp; retrieve ; quit .
&quot; the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; gu@@ inea ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) , these options do not particularly address these options . &quot;
&quot; in order to scan a picture , the user can start a preview scan and then scan for the scan area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button . &quot;
&quot; to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom in such a way that the complete preview will fit into the window . &quot;
&quot; if the image is selected , the final image can be read with the scan button . &quot;
&quot; when saving a preview in the settings , then the image is displayed in a preview window as shown below . when saving is pressed , then the image is saved and Sch@@ lie ? en leads to a demo@@ lition and you get back to the main window . &quot;
&quot; through the Settings button , the dialog with the same name will be opened in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot;
&quot; the user can view the image if desired , before saving . in this case the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option has to be selected . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows them to select the way you want to save images . dialog to save for each image opens the dialog in front of each sc@@ anned image . if you want to save this automatically with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to select saving without asking for a file name . &quot;
&quot; this setting defines where the images are stored in the Save option without asking for a file name . if the images are stored after each scan , then this folder will be used as a standard for the Save dialog . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... &quot;
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the automatically stored images and is beyond the proposed name for the image in the dialog for saving . the automatically saved image gets a numer@@ ical suff@@ ix of each time a picture is stored . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
&quot; the user can adjust the image quality used to store . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if select the image quality not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used . &quot;
the Help button starts the K@@ DE help with the &amp; chan@@ l@@ ite ; -@@ manual . the button About starts the K@@ DE via dialog for &amp; channel ; . the button Settings dialog displays the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to quit &amp; channel ; to quit .
&quot; &amp; gu@@ inea ; is licensed under the GP@@ L and the lib@@ ks@@ ane library used by &amp; sc@@ l@@ ite , under L@@ GP@@ L . attention : lib@@ san@@ e is licensed under the GP@@ L with an exception . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; used like all other short@@ cuts . below you will find a list of this short@@ cuts and their function . the global keyboard short@@ cuts can be set up by clicking the right mouse button in the player window and set down short commands ... Select .
&quot; you may set up existing multimedia buttons in such a way that they operate as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; short commands work , making your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ control center . &quot;
&quot; the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many common features mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P features of collection , context browsers , players , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , and scripts . &quot;
Amar@@ ok supports the command @-@ line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition Amar@@ ok has some own command @-@ line options .
&quot; you should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing depen@@ dency . please check in your script whether all the required modules are present and use k@@ alogs , so that the user knows why a script is not running . &quot;
begin with require &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; rescue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit
&quot; in the scripts / templates folder , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply add them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple . &quot;
&quot; with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command ; any K@@ DE installation should be included . &quot;
&quot; most scrip@@ ting languages allow the execution of external programs and commands . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; is usually called ex@@ ec ( ) . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python : &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this reason , scripts should continuously monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore events if there is no use for it . &quot;
&quot; configure Feed the script to display the setup dialog . to save and load the setup data , each script itself needs to take care of itself . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored . &quot;
track@@ Change signals that a new piece is played . the script now could ask for more information about the new piece with D@@ CO@@ P ( for example the metadata or the length of the piece ) .
volume Change new@@ Volume indicates a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le paths Con@@ tains the path to the selected files of the playlist if a user @-@ defined menu item is cli@@ cked . sub@@ menu and it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le can be used to remove the script from d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
&quot; before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; ends , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to perform cleaning work , e.g. storing data or configuration settings . &quot;
Amar@@ o@@ ks script administration can also install script packages that the user &amp; z@@ b has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) that can optionally also be detected with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) .
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the addition of amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should name your script packages right away . &quot;
&quot; the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules to be loaded should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to obtain the file &apos;s rights : &quot;
&quot; if your script package is ready , you can go up to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wi@@ ki scripts page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; app@@ end . for your entry on k@@ de apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
&quot; with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can easily drag music into the playlist , instead of having to work through endless menus . maybe you just search for a very specific title from thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collection browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds . &quot;
&quot; maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but can never decide which you want to hear ? then the play@@ lists browser is just the right thing for you . and if you still find the decision still hard , select the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . &quot;
&quot; usually , you have to enter the following in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources to compile and install Amar@@ ok : &quot;
&quot; since &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake use , you should not have any difficulties when comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options that you can enable or disable at compile time with the configure script . this is a list of options available . &quot;
&quot; for some of the compilation options , certain depen@@ dencies must be met so that they can be used . &quot;
&quot; activate de@@ bu@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without effort using the setup dialog . the furnishing dialog has several flash@@ cards for setting up the different functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
&quot; if the option is off , only the play@@ lists window will be displayed . &quot;
use mood bar@@ ometer : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . the option switches off the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer .
design : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . this changes the color scheme used for the tuning bar@@ ometer .
dropping voice files from the music files : this feature is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . otherwise the .@@ mood files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; stored ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
external browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to start when a browser is required .
use other browser : you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list above .
&quot; save Play@@ lists when moving , save the current playlist by moving &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . enable this option if you do not want to lose the current playlist when moving . &quot;
&quot; relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to music files , starting from the location of the playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of music files will be stored . &quot;
&quot; to keep the current piece visible while changing the piece , the play@@ lists window will pop up / roll to keep the current piece always visible in the visible window area . &quot;
switching to the context @-@ browser automatically displays the context @-@ browser as soon as the next piece is played .
&quot; in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section , you can customize &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s appearance . the section is divided into three parts . &quot;
&quot; in the font section , you can set the use of different fon@@ ts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; set . using proprietary fon@@ ts , the otherwise grey presented section will be activated . you can select fon@@ ts for the following area : playlist windows , player windows and context @-@ browser . &quot;
&quot; with the selection user defined color scheme , you have the source of choice and you can set your own color scheme . &quot;
&quot; restart when starting , that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after the program start , resume playback automatically with the piece at the place , with which it has been stopped at the last stop . &quot;
&quot; the on @-@ screen display allows you to turn on the O@@ SD . when using on @-@ screen display , a preview of the O@@ SD will be displayed and you can view the effect of all settings directly in this preview . &quot;
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadow causes the text to be sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
use your own colors gives you the option to adjust the O@@ SD colors for writing and background . one click on the color faces opens the dialog box for color selection . if your own colors are not enabled the pres@@ et &amp; k@@ de ; colors are used .
the input field display text displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering space holders the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the screen option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to specify which screen of a multiple monitor environment the O@@ SD should appear .
the card card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down box . some drivers still activate other settings in this card card .
the card collection is used to set all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of the database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folder , which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for music files . to include a folder into the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also includes check boxes for setting up how to proceed with the selected folders . &quot;
search recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the checked and their sub@@ folders will be searched for music .
&quot; monitor changes : allow &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders to changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) , and an incre@@ mental search is carried out to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
import Play@@ lists : cause &amp; Amar@@ ok ; add all found play@@ lists to your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will then appear later in the play@@ lists browser .
&quot; the collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver : allows you to choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further equipment is needed in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window . &quot;
&quot; the My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup is used to set the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; using calcul@@ ator : enter the host on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . then , under Port : the network port is entered , under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established . &quot;
use User@@ name : and Password : to enter the data required to connect to the database .
the card@@ boards last@@ .@@ f@@ m addresses the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece if required .
&quot; here , enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website . &quot;
send played pieces and update the profile so that this setting allows you &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
&quot; similar interpre@@ ters can be called : after activation of this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list of similar interpre@@ ters can be retri@@ eved to the played piece . note : you don &apos;t need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok only needs the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you need to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the included programs because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide how to compile k@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
&quot; some functions such as the O@@ SD pres@@ upp@@ ose that your window manager will keep the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org . thus , Gn@@ ome will work , but Flu@@ x@@ box will work for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because they provide an excellent development environment . &quot;
you can locate the file in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also app@@ end the broken file that caused the crash .
&quot; most of the time , when reading the met@@ a @-@ information from this file , please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot;
if you use MySQL as a database then try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a bit more mature .
&quot; make sure that all of the libraries used by &amp; Amar@@ ok are compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if , for example , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this leads to crashes when editing the met@@ a information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d , then disable autom@@ . disable when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least do not use a value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the email opens automatically when it crash ) . if it is a frequent crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error is guaranteed . &quot;
&quot; this is because many programs write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 into the met@@ a @-@ information , but do not mark them as a Uni@@ code . the following Perl script resol@@ ves the problem . &quot;
&quot; # ! / usr / bin / per@@ l &quot; &quot; The file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; &quot; -@@ f $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ; &quot;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b . it can be re @-@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b &apos;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / repetition / Dynamic playlist ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , the symbol effects are simply forgotten . &quot;
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map then check if Amar@@ ok is the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
&quot; to fix this bug , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will find the correct version first . &quot;
there are several possibilities . most installation problems are easiest by the help of an expert in your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or developers . use the forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ .net in channel # Amar@@ ok .
&quot; bow@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for searching for help . please enter only one error there , if you do something about the correction of a bug in Amar@@ ok yourself . &quot;
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only a blank playlist appears . how do music pieces come in there ?
this is easy . use the file browser on the left @-@ hand side and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
&quot; to keep the surface intuitive , the startup window was converted into the statisti@@ c window . you will find it under Extras statistics . &quot;
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for evaluation by the user while the points are automatically calculated .
&quot; to rate pieces , the evaluation column must be displayed in the playlist . click on the playlist and select column . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works when Amar@@ ok is in the background . &quot;
&quot; select the files you want to remove , and then press Del@@ ete on your keyboard . or right @-@ click on your selection and then select From Play@@ list Rem@@ ove From the drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
drag a playlist with the mouse to the playlist and let them drop exactly as you would with other files . that &apos;s what it &apos;s like : - )
&quot; in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , next to the Add button , the playlist is stored . click on it . &quot;
&quot; the program x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config is probably missing . install the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ ations , this package contains many very nice visu@@ al@@ isations . &quot;
the equ@@ ali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . you can also find it via the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
&quot; no . yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses a back@@ end independent approach , so the real question is what media types support G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / MAS / MAS / MAS / MAS / MAS / MAS / MAS / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . &quot;
&quot; it may ! maybe you use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which no MP3 deco@@ ders are included in default ( for pat@@ ent@@ - reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 @-@ de , input t@@ ass@@ el &quot;
start the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s : - )
&quot; if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa @-@ sink , the device has to provide a bl@@ ender . a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software mixer ) . &quot;
&quot; the output of this command should help you search for the problem cause and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to specify a different ink ( e.g. os@@ s@@ sink ) . &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t forget that media will need to be deco@@ ded first . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice for most people if you &apos;re looking for a decoder with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes them and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System Settings . enable sound server with highest priority ( real @-@ time priority ) , and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . &quot;
&quot; with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x , there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ de@@ cs that can cause disturbed playback . read this error report . the magni@@ fying of the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help . &quot;
&quot; either do not use the Arts Driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia to get the faster Arts co@@ de@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc . ) . &quot;
&quot; probably use the Arts Driver . use a different driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been strongly optimized for analy@@ zers ) , or reduce the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; ab . why ? &quot;
&quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all the components . register now to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components . &quot;
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help you can also ask the IR@@ C channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
&quot; then delete this ( quit Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then delete all ff@@ m@@ peg files in the module folder of G@@ Stre@@ amer ( you will find the module folder with you @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run it again . now start &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . &quot;
please report it under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. if you have a whole list of suggestions / wishes please send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album of the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . in addition , the name contains the magic K ... : ) &quot;
&quot; thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . put an alarm in your calendar program and run the alarm with this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play &quot;
&quot; this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you will have arous@@ ed by the soft sounds of the music you have stopped before bed . &quot;
how to find the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; running titles if you are on another computer ?
if a working SS@@ H environment is present you can proceed as follows . this command will give you the interpreter and title of the running piece : SS@@ H -@@ i ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ usable name Amar@@ ok player now@@ playing
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this requires your identification in the ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ R@@ SA file .
the visu@@ al@@ isations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ window . press d on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent window in the size of changeable windows .
the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + Right mouse button puts a piece in the click sequence into the queue . by pressing the entry button after a search in the playlist the first search result will be played and the search returned .
&quot; OK , the player window and the playlist have tricky functions , but how does it look like the icon in the control bar &apos;s system section ? &quot;
&quot; click the &quot; &quot; &amp; R@@ MB@@ n &quot; &quot; button on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browser should be displayed . &quot;
my Personal folder $ HO@@ ME is on a NFS mount . after the start of Amar@@ ok the collection database cannot be created and many error messages appear on the console .
&quot; the internal SQ@@ Lite database from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive , or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support . &quot;
&quot; go to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic code , instead , take files from the folders mp3 or o@@ gg . &quot;
&quot; Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( Q@@ String ( &quot; &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escap@@ e@@ String ( ur@@ l ) ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; basically , this adap@@ ts the previous assessment with a dimin@@ ishing value based on how often the play has been played . the more the play has been played , the less influence each score has on the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can add the rating for a piece by yourself by right @-@ clicking on a column header in the playlist window . then you can change the rating of a piece just like all other attributes , by selecting the right mouse button on the piece and press Edit : select rating or press F@@ 2 . you can also edit the rating in the metadata dialog . &quot;
&quot; the developers do not want you to tell you when you want to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a specified release plan , not to bring together the scheduled plan of Amar@@ ok . &quot;
this is a new feature in Amar@@ ok which some users can find annoying too . de@@ activate the option icon while playing in the general settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select Settings Tool@@ bars ... and take the required changes there .
&quot; download a design , or create your own . install it under Amar@@ ok ... Ap@@ pear@@ ance context browser design , click New Design .... &quot;
the symbol was similar to War@@ p Graphi@@ cs Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) logo . to avoid difficulties it was removed .
&quot; select Kon@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation range . then click the button Settings ( the top ) , and select Add Amar@@ ok in the drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
audio @-@ rob@@ bler is a free service to be sent to the information on which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free username and password . audio c@@ rob@@ bler is completely supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; supported .
&quot; if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and a lot of bug reports . &quot;
&quot; probably , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine does not compile these output modules . you need to configure and install Amar@@ ok ; re@@ configure and install . &quot;
now I &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed but the output modules still don &apos;t appear . and now ?
&quot; you probably need to install the package G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel . the same goes for x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that you need to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . &quot;
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ I@@ CAL * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos;s no type .. How can I fix it ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer has been compiled with shr@@ inking which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without shr@@ inking . a tip of mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : do not use L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ ok .
I get an error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 although the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .
&quot; to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module must also be installed next to G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad . &quot;
you will receive the error There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .

I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how to use Amar@@ ok the second sound card ?
set up under Settings Amar@@ ok ... Audio output set the device . typical is e.g. h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here is an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an onboard AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
p@@ cm@@ .@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type h@@ w : 0 &quot; ct@@ l.@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
&quot; enter into the setup dialog by x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio , and the output takes place on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of the conversion of the sample rate , channels and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , disable the check@@ box at sound card supports m@@ map . &quot;
&quot; we are sorry , but the audio issue with Arts will not be cared for further . you may naturally like to take this issue yourself into your own hands ! if you want , you can become the new so much @-@ needed tut@@ or for Arts : ) &quot;
&quot; if you want to upgrade your collection afterwards , or simply don &apos;t like the wizard , then this Quick Start Guide will help you . with your help you will have set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; set up in a few minutes . &quot;
&quot; creating a playlist is very simple . drag items from the collection browser to the playlist . if you are happy with the playlist , you can save them using the playlist playlist . you will find this button in the tool@@ bar of the playlist window . &quot;
&quot; if you have own play@@ lists , you can add them to the playlist browser . if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection , and you have enabled the option to import play@@ lists , you will find different ways to load the playlist . &quot;
&quot; to play an audio CD , select Ac@@ tions Audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with multiple folders and the CD pieces in WAV format . drag the wa@@ v files into the playlist and press the playback button . &quot;
the audio CD function uses the audio @-@ oc@@ d protocol : / and is not compatible with all drivers available .
the burning feature is also available in the playlist . just right @-@ click on one entry and follow the burning menu . you have several options to burn a CD here .
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; pres@@ upp@@ oses the installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . furthermore , some additional packages are listed that make the work with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more pleasant . &quot;
&quot; if you install these packages via a package management system ( e.g. RPM or apt ) , you also need to install the development versions of these packages ! &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . like any normal multimedia player , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a player window with the most important functions . &quot;
&quot; this chapter outlines how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok are used , including the creation of a collection and a playlist . &quot;
&quot; the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . at the top of the window , there is a running text display displaying the current play time , bit rate and sam@@ pl@@ er@@ ate of the current piece . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the Player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , also under the running text display . you can change through the available Analy@@ zer by clicking on the area with the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , enlarged window . &quot;
&quot; under the scroll bar , the PL and E@@ Q buttons are also located . the PL button activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the playlist window while the E@@ Q button is used to set equ@@ ali@@ zers . &quot;
&quot; the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the piece position sli@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; the use of the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classic to techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own pres@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; to display the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use Extras equ@@ ali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you activate the E@@ quali@@ zer check box , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation . &quot;
&quot; the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most advanced playlist of all available for &amp; k@@ de , available multimedia players . it has many features that do not exist in any other player . but don &apos;t let the abundance of functions deter you , they &apos;re all easy to use . &quot;
&quot; the playlist can be divided into two main areas , on the left is the navigation area . in the navigation area , you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser . the playlist is easy to use and yet even for advanced users powerful enough . &quot;
&quot; the context @-@ browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and interpreter . these three sub@@ windows will later be explained in detail . they provide information on the current piece to different aspects . &quot;
&quot; if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you might notice that the bottom window is off . the information presented there is now distributed in other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the information can also be collected in the Statisti@@ cs window ( Extras Statisti@@ cs ) . &quot;
&quot; the sub@@ windows music displays information about the currently running piece , as well as the artist and the album . &quot;
&quot; the first area in this sub @-@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , artist and the album . below you can see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . click on this icon to track the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database . &quot;
&quot; below the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon you will find more information about the current piece . you can see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time , as well as its rating . &quot;
&quot; the file formats .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ p@@ ng are supported . the images can have any name , but pictures with the word front in the name are preferred . the context @-@ browser will also display cover images , which are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
&quot; the next area , Recommen@@ ded items , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately . &quot;
among the favourite pieces are the favourite pieces of this artist . this area shows the five most rated pieces of the current artist .
you can set which information should be displayed in the music sub@@ window . right @-@ click anywhere in the sub@@ window and choose from the contex@@ tual menu .
&quot; the last area , albums of the artist , lists all the albums of the latest artist you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will work out and you see the content of the album . &quot;
you can click on all the pieces in the single areas to start playing immediately . you can also click on it with the right mouse button and select one of the options to add the piece or album to the playlist .
&quot; in the sub@@ window text , the downloaded song text is displayed for the current piece . this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other websites using self @-@ written scripts . &quot;
&quot; the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version will then be stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database , and no running text script is required . &quot;
the Find button will open a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com after the song text for the current piece ( in an external browser window ) .
&quot; group Interpre@@ t - only group the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the performer . albums or genres are ignored . &quot;
&quot; group Interpre@@ t / Album - Only the pieces are arranged according to the artist , and below will be a further division after the respective album . if you want to see compil@@ ations or soundtrack albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under different interpre@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; group Interpre@@ t / Year - Album - Sor@@ ted to Interpre@@ t and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the newest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - album name is related . &quot;
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically among each other . the artist is ignored .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t - your pieces will be sorted by genre and by artist sorted by artist .
&quot; group Genre / Interpre@@ t / Album - This setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by album underneath the interpreter . &quot;
&quot; with the help of the remaining buttons , you can adjust and combine the group@@ ing at will . &quot;
&quot; with the last button , you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically capture your collection once you change something to the selected folders . if you own many pieces , this could take a while . &quot;
directly under the tool@@ bar there is a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . references to the use of this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual .
&quot; under the search filter there is a selection box , with which you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection . you can also select your complete collection from the last 24 hours to a year . furthermore , you can of course also select your total collection , whereby the filter is switched off practically . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you will receive the following options . &quot;
load - This emp@@ ties the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order in the playback .
attach to playlist - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on one entry you reach the same effect .
set pieces in queue - this feature adds the selected pieces to the queue . this will be played next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you will be asked for a name under which the list should be saved .
&quot; transfer to Media Player - Add the pieces into the queue to transfer to the media player . for more details , see the section on the Media Player Browser . &quot;
&quot; burn all pieces of this interpreter / burn to CD - Therefore the selected pieces are sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as a data or audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option will not be displayed . &quot;
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - open the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
( n ) move files in the tr@@ ash bin ... - open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm that the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
&quot; mark the selected album as a compilation , and it appears under different interpre@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; undo the compilation mark - change a record selected as a compilation album back into a normal album . afterwards , the album will no longer be shown under different interpre@@ ters , but again under the corresponding interpreter . &quot;
&quot; the play@@ lists browser makes handling many play@@ lists easy . among other things , it also contains intelligent play@@ lists . &quot;
the lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart play@@ lists . these use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists for running time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that has never been played .
&quot; even created smart play@@ lists are possible . click on Smart Play@@ lists to open the dialog for creating a new Smart playlist , where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist . &quot;
&quot; the sub@@ window Media Player is used for the connection of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for example , you can use your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for example , you will need to locate the pieces on your iPod by interpreter in the top list view of the Media Player browser . &quot;
&quot; to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired songs from the playlist and let them fall on the list Interpre@@ t . by doing so , the pieces will be uploaded to your iPod . &quot;
&quot; under the tool@@ bar there is a search area that you can search for a file . the search is particularly useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden , which do not match your search criteria . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part of the file browser , there is an address bar that lets you grab music from a entered URL . if you enter tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z for example , you can drag and drop music from there to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; if the playlist is longer than in the window , the atta@@ ching of the Shift key can be helpful . in this case , the holding of the Shift key can be helpful : this way , drop @-@ in files will be inserted automatically at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position . &quot;
&quot; you can change the order by simply drag the entries with the mouse to the desired place and drop them . as soon as you enter letters , only the pieces that contain the letters will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; if you enter del@@ im@@ ited search terms , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries that contain all search terms . for example , if you enter one of two , the search will find all entries containing one , two , and three . &quot;
&quot; for example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found that contain one or two or three ( or a combination ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for entries containing spaces , then close the keyword with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will look for entries that include Mike Old@@ field , but not for entries like Mike J. Old@@ field . &quot;
&quot; for example , rating : &gt; 50 . this will look for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something looks for pieces that do not contain something . &quot;
you can combine these syntax variants as you like . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bathroom . this looks for all pieces that either include Mike Old@@ field or have a higher rating than 50 and not included the comment .
&quot; you can set the sequence of entries by holding down the C@@ tr@@ l key , and right @-@ click the entries in the desired sequence . the entries then get a mark with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some features of the playlist . on the left hand , you will find the Add button that you can add to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; next , follow the buttons for undo and restore , so you can undo or restore changes to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the tool@@ bar there is a unique , enlarged analy@@ zer . the refres@@ her rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer . &quot;
the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as the one you get in the player window over the right mouse button . over this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s configuration .
&quot; there are many more buttons for the tool@@ bar , for example ren@@ dition controls and volume control . you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and selecting tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; the Status Bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information on the playlist . it displays the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces . &quot;
you can also hide the status bar . disable the status bar option in the general settings .
&quot; the context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the menu in the playlist . through this menu you can reach the settings of &amp; Amar@@ ok . &quot;
&quot; click on this entry to open the Visu@@ alization plugin window , where you can select the visu@@ al@@ isations of &amp; Amar@@ ok . &quot;
behind this entry is a sub @-@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the cover administration is a useful tool for managing your artwork images . you can start it by selecting actions cover administration in the collection browser .
the Cover Administration contains a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all the albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the interpreter on the left @-@ hand side .
&quot; with the View menu , you can select what should be displayed in the cover administration . select from : &quot;
&quot; the queue management got your big move in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this feature you have more control over the playlist . after you have set a piece into the queue , the playlist appears in the playlist : 1 is played first , 2 as second , and so on . &quot;
&quot; the queue management will open you over Extras queue management . if you want to add a piece to the queue , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also easily add the pieces to the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue management . &quot;
&quot; there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already pre@@ defined ( the details of the setup of these are later ) . &quot;
fills your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and adds additional random items during playback .
adds pieces based on Last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : audio @-@ rob@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile so that this dynamic playlist works .
&quot; double click on the playlist you want , drag it into the playlist window or right @-@ click on it and then select Lo@@ ad . thus , your current playlist will be replaced by the new playlist . so you should save the old playlist in circumstances ! &quot;
&quot; the two pre @-@ set mix and playlist mix immediately fill your playlist and you can directly start playing . the play@@ lists Recommen@@ ded items begin with an empty playlist and you will have to add at least one piece by yourself from your collection , so your playlist will only be filled at the end of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the current playlist , activate the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic mode . this will be your existing playlist as a starting point . &quot;
&quot; the New Fil@@ l button completes the current playlist , adding new pieces to the dynamic mode . edit playlist opens the dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the appropriate settings . &quot;
&quot; with a right @-@ click on a dynamic playlist , you have the option to click Edit . as a result , the dialog opens to edit the playlist settings . &quot;
&quot; here , enter any name for the playlist . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow , the setting for upcoming items will be ski@@ pped and they will not hear a piece in this playlist . if the setting is active , the already played pieces will be removed under consideration of the settings . &quot;
&quot; played pieces - this is the number of plays played at the beginning of the playlist , so you can easily see which pieces were played recently . &quot;
&quot; this is the number of pieces that are to be added after each played piece to the playlist . if you set more than 1 , the playlist will continue to grow , because only one piece can be played and removed . &quot;
&quot; the settings on the right side have already been described in the previous section . on the left @-@ hand side of the dialog , you can select from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . &quot;
some scripts allow your own settings . you can customize the settings by starting the script and then click Con@@ figuration .
&quot; you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; install scripts by clicking on the script . it will open a selection dialog , where you can install a script package to install . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to use a script for longer , you can delete it . select the script to delete and then click Un@@ install . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for information on writing your own scripts , please refer to Writ@@ ing Scrip@@ ts section . &quot;
&quot; the dialog window Visu@@ alization Plugins is used to activate the available Visu@@ aliz@@ ations in &amp; Amar@@ ok . the window contains a list of all available plu@@ gins . to use a plug @-@ in , simply activate the check box next to the name . &quot;
&quot; this quick guide will show you how to create an audio CD with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b in four steps . to understand the steps , you need to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files . &quot;
this is a dialog box where you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
&quot; if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 or other los@@ s@@ less compressed formats , remember that when re@@ encoding MP3 , you will get a worse quality , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD was created from a los@@ s@@ less format . &quot;
&quot; in this dialog box , you can do nothing . please wait until the computer has finished the burning process . &quot;
&quot; this quick guide will show you how to copy &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; a data CD in just four steps . to understand the steps , you need to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; have inserted the source CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive . &quot;
&quot; to copy a data CD , please select Extras , copy CD ... from the menu . you now see a dialog with the possible settings for burning . &quot;
&quot; after you have made all &amp; k@@ 3@@ b settings , please press the Start button . you now see a dialog that looks like this : &quot;
&quot; in this dialog window , you can track the progress of the copy process . once the original image is entered into the image file , you will be asked for an empty CD medium to which the data should be burned . &quot;
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burn the image file . you must wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burn the image file . you must wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
&quot; to fix this problem , start q@@ t@@ config and add $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS / li@@ b / k@@ de@@ 3 / plu@@ gins to the search path for libraries ( replace $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS through your base folder of &amp; k@@ de ; ) . &quot;
&quot; the website of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; can be found at www.@@ k@@ 3@@ b.@@ org , where you will get the latest version of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b , you will need at least &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 and &amp; q@@ t ; 3.1 . &quot;
&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in a flow ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&quot; &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ ofs ; : burn all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the functions that also &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; usually automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for burning CDs . in some cases , &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; however , a higher quality of recorded audio CDs . &quot;
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for the reading of digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) .
&quot; O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patent @-@ free and professional technology for audio encoding and handling audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and is in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by the O@@ gg Vor@@ bis decoder and enco@@ der modules . &quot;
&quot; M@@ ad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module . &quot;
l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 En@@ co@@ der module .
&quot; fla@@ c : a free open source co@@ dec for los@@ s@@ less audio compression and compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and external audio enco@@ der module , so you can read and write FLA@@ C files . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , ff@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Dec@@ oder : other libraries for processing different audio formats . with ff@@ m@@ peg , for example , it is possible to de@@ code WMA files to burn them to an audio CD . de@@ co &quot;
SO@@ X : an auxiliary program that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the SO@@ X Audio En@@ co@@ der module .
trans@@ code : a command @-@ line program for video editing . you will need it if you want to read a DVD .
&quot; V@@ C@@ DI@@ ma@@ ger : a feature full featured auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analyzing video CDs and super video CDs . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . this can , for example , be useful for creating mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the unpleasant effect that the music pieces are played differently . &quot;
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start CD and automatically play all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the accompanying sub @-@ menu includes a list of these projects . one click on one entry will open the project .
&quot; save the current project . if the project has already been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name . &quot;
save the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s Di@@ alogue Save As will be shown to select folder and file name for the project file .
save all opened projects . this is the same as if you would like to file saved for each project file .
&quot; closes the current project . if a project is changed and not yet saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what should happen . you can then choose between saving and changes . you can also cancel the closing and keep the project open . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any project that is not saved , just as if you would have called for each project file . &quot;
&quot; includes all opened projects and finished &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each project not saved , you will be asked what to do with it as if you have called file closing . &quot;
&quot; if you call this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as if you are using the files directly from the top view to the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the files added will appear in the basic folder of the CD . &quot;
&quot; the only difference is the additional button B@@ race , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to run the medium . the burning dialogue can only be opened when the project already contains data . &quot;
&quot; opens the properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described by the What is this ? help ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . &quot;
this entry only appears in an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session to the current project .
this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function removes no files from the medium ; it only blocks the previously imported files .
&quot; alternatively you can only create a copy of a CD , which you can then burn later . you should prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; the conversion / reduction of a DVD with the help of copying dialog is not yet supported , so the target medium must be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in its original form . &quot;
&quot; opens the dialog for del@@ eting a CD @-@ RW , so you can delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW . &quot;
&quot; opens the dialog for format@@ ting a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , whereby the content is completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the writing modes over@@ writing and incre@@ mental . &quot;
&quot; burn a previously created CD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source that can then immediately be burned by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ o * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
burns a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o file as a data source which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button .
&quot; this dialog window usually appears after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used alone . it contains information about the read @-@ out video , coding settings , and even ways to change the size and cut black edges . &quot;
&quot; displays information on the inserted medium . this information is displayed in the table of contents and contains properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . if an entry is checked , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; if this is enabled , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not enabled , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; the folder view includes an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , its contents will be displayed in the table of contents . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locks and unlock the disk or ej@@ ecting the media . &quot;
&quot; the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , if a drive is selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; the header is a narrow range , which is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the header strip does not have any real function , it only looks pretty and clearly separates the project view from the rest of the views . &quot;
&quot; this opens up a dialog box for changing the ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ kes for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b . after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ kes below . &quot;
&quot; this will start k@@ 3@@ b , setup wizard . thus , the correct per@@ missions for burning CDs and DVDs can be set . therefore , you must enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) at the start of the wizard . &quot;
open the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general programming positions can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work on startup . this dialog is designed to person@@ alize and fine @-@ adjust the program .
&quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; node ; applications , also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . using this interface , parts of functionality can be controlled via a shell script . &quot;
&quot; you can use either the d@@ co@@ p command line program or a slightly more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical to the functions of the function , so your taste and style of your task will be crucial as to which of the programs you specify . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter , we assume you are using the d@@ co@@ p command line program . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , you must first make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; started . then enter something like the following on the console : &quot;
&quot; in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that have common in common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts described below . &quot;
&quot; the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ CD , format@@ DVD and other functions for creating new projects . &quot;

&quot; as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , one gets a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly generated project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively one can obtain a project via the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ o@@ d and then a reference to the project by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface . &quot;
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface that can only be used on data @-@ projects ( CD and DVD ) :
&quot; void add@@ Ur@@ l ( Q@@ String name , Q@@ String Quart@@ z ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( Q@@ String path ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( Q@@ String path ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( Q@@ String path ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String New@@ Name ) void set@@ Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String id ) &quot;
&quot; this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders , and then adds files to the new folder : &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ Re@@ ading for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it you can easily record audio CD ; s read and stored in MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . also other formats are possible , depending on enco@@ der installed on the computer . &quot;
currently l@@ ame for MP3 , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs and FLA@@ C ( los@@ s@@ less compression ) is supported by default ( these enco@@ ders need to be installed from the Linux distribution ) . other enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) . &quot;
first the titles of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in wa@@ v files on the computer ( loss @-@ free and compressed ) ; and then
&quot; in a second step , these wa@@ v files ( usually one per title ) are compressed into the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format , or also in other formats such as los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C . &quot;
&quot; for the first step , reading &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , it must be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step you have to install l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; which coding / file format is to be used ? the Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer chapter gives a small introduction to enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word to copy protected audio CDs ; s : as already said , use &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read out audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to b@@ ypass any copy protection . &quot;
&quot; while setting up only needs to be done ( the setup dialog can be called up until a suitable configuration has been found ) , then the daily handling for reading a &amp; CD will be explained to the hard disk . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the slim approach of the user interface , over which you frequently stum@@ ble at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; convert into many formats - depending on which enco@@ der programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; can &amp; CD ; fetch information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the internet , or can work completely without a network , whereby everything is recorded manually . &quot;
&quot; this is only a short list of the commands of the main window . on the page , for example , you will find more information how this program is used as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tab@@ s for the configuration of the program . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ DB request of the CD@@ DB will start by setting up your request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this may be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be made . ) &quot;
start reading and - if a enco@@ der is configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup directory - the encoding .
&quot; open a sub@@ menu with a list of available enco@@ ders , so that the selection can be read out with a different enco@@ der than the default . it is to be noted that previously the enco@@ der was configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; opens the file manager , so that an already read file is selected for encoding rather than a full &amp; CD ; read and code . &quot;
&quot; opens the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as logs , pi@@ ep@@ ses ) for program events ( such as reading &amp; CD ; finished ) . &quot;
open the main setup dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with various flash@@ cards ( like En@@ co@@ der to set up the enco@@ der ) . here you have to go before the program can be used successfully !
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ der and compression ratios and helps you choose the right enco@@ der . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is to be lost , a loss @-@ free audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are also other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; , which may be available for this distribution . &quot;
&quot; among the audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit rate the differences are less important since both enco@@ ders generate very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos; not so &apos; free , l@@ ame will still be included with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license questions &quot;
&quot; + high up to very high sound quality ( with high bit@@ rates ) , but slightly lower quality compared with O@@ GG at lower bit@@ rates . &quot;
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG play@@ sets exists .
&quot; MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special auto stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices usually only support MP3 format . &quot;
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has already quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . requires up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . requires 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a song . good enough for music of young people , portable devices and car stere@@ os . but not good enough for better hi @-@ fi stereo systems . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want the absolute highest quality regardless of the file size , then choose this setting . &quot;
&quot; you can pass / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the coding program to create folder and file names , as well as the properties of music files . &quot;
&quot; in connection with coding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the enco@@ der and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example , to add the &amp; CD ; title to the keyword ( English : tag ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t@@ t of l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator must be added . the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button labeled in the wizard ) :
&quot; this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read / enter the audio CDs instead of entering the information instead of entering the computer . it is to be noted that only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; titles , artists , names of pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I ( note the translator ) is not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; information that is publicly available on the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be har@@ med . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; actively to select a check box ( sending an address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b can be used with another ( counter@@ f@@ eit ) address than those used in the system . in this type of configuration , so it seems , the email address is not used when retri@@ eving data from the server ( This can only be known by the programmer who checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server should be needed . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts . &quot;
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during the reading of a &amp; CD ; . alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which reading program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
&quot; there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more precisely , search in source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading Audio CD ; s . note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; for saving the read WAV files , the enco@@ der and thus the desired file format can be selected . the first opening contains pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , o@@ ggen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab for setting up the enco@@ der . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab . &quot;
the enco@@ der package must be installed by the concerned Linux distribution before the enco@@ der can be used . this is also required for pre@@ defined enco@@ ders . more information about enco@@ ders can be found in the Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer chapter .
&quot; after installing a enco@@ der , you can receive more information about its switches by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; Con@@ sole ) . &quot; l@@ ame &quot; must be replaced by the name of the installed enco@@ der . &quot;
&quot; check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , write and write real on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia as well as the audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc . ) are installed . &quot;
check if you don &apos;t want a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with one step for step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V@@ 1 keyword ( tags ) . &quot;
&quot; there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . for example , a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found using a search engine since it is considered not entirely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can always do . &quot;
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permission ( eg ; by trying to copy something into the kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
&quot; the first section deals with the basic set @-@ up of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator , something that will probably only be done once and &quot;
&quot; the second section describes the procedure to read out a &amp; CD , which must be repeated for each reading &amp; CD ; &quot;
here we determine the enco@@ der to be used to compression the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps ) .
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not be able to change it with each reading of a &amp; CD ; change once the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the device name will be handed over to the reading program so that it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
&quot; often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive . if this doesn &apos;t work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the entries in the device names for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
&quot; the tab card General Settings . here there is not much to do . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything will be left / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot . &quot;
&quot; only in case of incomplete information , select , so that you will be informed when information for generating sample words ( tags ) is missing . &quot;
the card card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are com@@ fy and om@@ it the &amp; CD ; data automatically via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the computer must be connected to the Internet during reading the &amp; CD ; so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
&quot; the second selection box is simpler , a &amp; CD ; entry is found , starts immediately reading the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk , if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , they can be changed easily . the directory and fil@@ en@@ ame will be changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or@@ - &gt; tag and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example , please keep in mind that if you want to enter everything manually , disable the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . however , if you want to use fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode , the two selection fields have to be selected , at least the first one . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from the fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . &quot;
&quot; mode : we did not download the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org and look for a mirror server nearby . on this way , the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will function as the first attempt . &quot;
&quot; both work equally as far as the server is concerned , but since many fire@@ walls boot the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there may be more luck with the 80 protocol , as the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we don &apos;t want to give &amp; CD ; data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . the first check box should be disabled . &quot;
just take over the settings of the screen shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
&quot; number of simultaneous plays : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time with just an existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author doesn &apos;t know , so simply try it yourself . &quot;
&quot; CD ; after reading the last piece , throw it out : check this on the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process . &quot;
&quot; custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then the path / folder must be specified in which the wa@@ v files are stored . if the field is not enabled , the files will be created in the private folder . don &apos;t forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files yourself . &quot;
&quot; enter everything as it is on the screen shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something must be fl@@ atten@@ ed to the right to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo systems . the resulting bit rate is about 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the resulting compression ratio is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption . &quot;
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the creation of tags on V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can also be deleted in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the complete path ) .
set the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
&quot; number of WAV files to be enco@@ ded at the same time : with a dual core or qu@@ ad , or even a multi@@ processor machine , you can try to en@@ code more than a WAV file at the same time . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; finished . this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wis@@ ely , you never need to change it again . &quot;
&quot; the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard drive is described in the previous section and set up . first , a connection to the Internet is built , as we are com@@ fy and the &amp; CD ; data from the fre@@ ed@@ b will need to be retri@@ eved . the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each reading &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; as we use a &amp; CD , which is not yet in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a bit different than those for a &amp; CD ; with the success of fre@@ ed@@ b retri@@ eved data . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually instead of retri@@ eving them from the internet . comments will indicate the differences . &quot;
don &apos;t try the &amp; CD ; this example can be found . it &apos;s a &apos; special &apos; issue by the author of this manual .
&quot; if this hasn &apos;t happened yet , the &amp; CD has to be inserted into the drive defined in the main window . &quot;
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as in the screen@@ shot . this only when the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD ; can be identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
&quot; if this is not done , look for the help section in the section &quot; &quot; Ques@@ tions and Ans@@ wers &quot; &quot; or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully picked up by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the pieces are already filled out and the name of the artist and the album are displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; -@@ key for your &amp; CD ; there , a window is displayed , and you can select the database entry , which in your opinion best fits your &amp; CD ; fits . &quot;
&quot; if you have not selected the check box for automatic retri@@ eval of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in dialog for settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you do not have a local database , but fetch the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet . &quot;
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - Input of the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
&quot; enter the data for your &amp; CD ; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Current Tit@@ le &apos; , the rest of the data in the &apos; Album &apos; input field . &quot;
the artist no longer needs to be entered in the &apos; Current Tit@@ le &apos; field unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
&quot; the lower commentary box can be used for individual comments per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments that are valid for all pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; attention : after successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor so that you are not only happy with the artist and album name ( e.g. whether all words start with capital letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the comment area . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tag information of the generated files later with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also re @-@ create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see the help of the enco@@ der to get more information .
&quot; simply select an entry that obviously corresponds to the style of the selected CD ; in this example , this is not important because we don &apos;t transmit the &amp; CD data anyway . for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org and read the information on the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are to be found under Rock . &quot;
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece .
&quot; the CD editor window appears again and you can see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data , which we recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . &quot;
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ;
note : this window does not appear when you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album will be shown above the unit list .
note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are marked so are read out . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece or out . make sure that all pieces are selected or press the button All items at the bottom of the screen to choose all the pieces at once .
&quot; by clicking on the selection button select the selection process started , this window appears to confirm . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track down what &apos;s going on . &quot;
&quot; click on the Ri@@ der orders to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar . &quot;
this is the window to control orders . the first piece is just read on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left bottom of the window in the status line .
you can see this error if you are trying to work with a enco@@ der you haven &apos;t installed yet . pieces that have not been successfully enco@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
&quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we typ@@ ed here in the example . did you check if you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - ) &quot;
now it is clear why the error occurred immediately after the end of the reading of the first piece .
&quot; the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : assignment # 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . this allows you to read and code in parallel . note the status message in the bottom part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes to read and code .
&quot; now the last song is read out , while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third job is in the queue of the enco@@ der . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window is displayed with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the enco@@ der of your choice . &quot;
&quot; if you are familiar with CVS , you can download an anonymous copy from there . most distri@@ butions already include a pre @-@ compiled package , because &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package is . if you read this , you probably have already done it ... &quot;
&quot; this section is aimed at people who compile from source files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for help just how the program can be adapted to your needs , once it &apos;s running , then the following is correct for you : &quot;
a program that calls many different programs has many options . it is best to read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen@@ shots of the different flash@@ cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
&quot; hello , still reading on ? even if only the Help Menu was cli@@ cked after the first start of the program , without any clu@@ e as it should continue from this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD in the drive at the time of the program start ) , or from the unusually short menu ? &quot;
what is it about ? who reads this has probably started the program . it should look something like this :
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is considered the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator . and if you read this , he left this section and is therefore agre@@ eing with this proposal . &quot;
&quot; strange if you managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these information , but ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ a@@ oke player from &amp; k@@ de ; besides others , he has also some features that other &amp; UNIX players do not have with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ a@@ oke real @-@ time high@@ lighting of texts . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound project drivers needed for G@@ US cards . Al@@ sa is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it &apos;s easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can drag in &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from one &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows can move to k@@ mid .
supports both existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) .
&quot; seat support . if you quit &amp; kiss ; while playing a song , k@@ mid will start with the same song again next time . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI synthes@@ izer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the L@@ up driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can select opening ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog , with which help you can select the desired song . &quot;
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; drop window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; this also works with multiple songs at the same time .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and press the Play button in the tool@@ bar , select the item Ab@@ play from the menu piece or press the space bar . &quot;
&quot; please note , that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece will automatically start as soon as you move it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window . ( with several pieces , they are added to a collection and then played sequ@@ enti@@ ally . ) &quot;
&quot; once &amp; k@@ mid ; play a piece , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive back and forth using the slider . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows left and right of the speed display , and change the playback speed . to get back the original tempo , double @-@ click the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar appears like a pressure on the button Pause or selecting the menu item Pause in the menu piece , so interrup@@ ts playback . press the space bar while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; the playback . &quot;
&quot; lyrics can be stored in two ways in a piece of music . some pieces use text , others use lyrics and other both . some pieces don &apos;t have a text : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid , you can set which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically calculated using a song so that you do not need to manually set the event manually . however , you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set an event type , select the settings of text and song events from the Settings menu . the same function also has buttons 1 and 2 . &quot;
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you can summari@@ ze . these are played back to the series . in this section you will find how to use collections efficiently .
&quot; to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find it in the menu collection under the item Organ@@ ize .... Click there on New and enter the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs at the beginning as the original ones .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can set the selected items in the collection manager . &quot;
the temporary collection contains all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
&quot; when you leave the application , this collection is not saved . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song using the Add button . it appears again the file dialog , with which help you can select the desired song . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on setting Automatic Add to the collection .
&quot; when automatic adding to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) . &quot;
&quot; when Automati@@ cally Add to the collection is not enabled , the temporary collection is activated when opening a piece . this collection will then be added to the un@@ opened pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the row from the menu sequence of the menu collections , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ a@@ oke text . &quot;
&quot; to skip a song , select the Next song , select next song from the menu piece or press the arrow to the right . &quot;
&quot; to reverse a song back , select the Pre@@ ferences piece , select Pre@@ vious pieces from the menu piece or press the arrow left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection and click the Del@@ ete button . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted , but this does not matter since it is not saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers , which are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map includes general MIDI events in events that the synthes@@ izer understands . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map which converts all the events of the Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et type and thus always sound a trumpet if originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you have only one sound card , you don &apos;t need MIDI @-@ map because all sound cards are GM compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps . you need to edit the corresponding file manually ( with your favorite editor ) . &quot;
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that stores all the required re@@ plac@@ ements for playing a piece .
&quot; each section may appear only once , except the key@@ map section that may appear as often as desired . &quot;
Def@@ ine PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; Name of the key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
see that Def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section begins ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as e @-@ mail so that I can offer support in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can be used for devices that are not General MIDI compatible .
&quot; in this section , you will see how the patches of General MIDI are displayed on your specific keyboard . the general use looks like this : &quot;
&quot; please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to set all sounds that this instrument needs to tone with the number M . if your keyboard does not support a gun@@ shot ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can use a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which sounds similar to a gun@@ shot . &quot;
&quot; so if a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 ( gun@@ shot ) , it takes Patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here with the term drum patch the patch is meant , in which each sound is another percussion instrument ( drums , bas@@ ins , mar@@ ac@@ as , etc . ) and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the same drum ( as some key@@ boards have it ) . &quot;
the key@@ map section is used to indicate how sounds are m@@ apped on a specific channel or instrument . the use is :
&quot; as with the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as its presence . so you need to create 128 items . &quot;
you can define several key maps for each channel and instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are mainly used to map tones to the perc@@ ussions channel . take a look as an example of the supplied key maps .
&quot; this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to swap the first and the second channel , simply do it in the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards that have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; if you use the key@@ map option , the key@@ map will be used with the name for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored to change the patch on this channel . in this case , patch x is always used . &quot;
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example to always use the perc@@ ussions patch on the perc@@ ussions channel .
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio speci@@ fies in which ratio P@@ itch @-@ Ben@@ der events are multip@@ lied . if therefore a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value n , it is converted with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then re@@ directed . the value 40@@ 96 is used to prevent dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as in the map file . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed because GM says there is a keyboard that is supposed to play a pitch Ben@@ der event with the value 40@@ 96 , to play a tone higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog . &quot;
&quot; the channel view is a window with a whole row of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these keyboard , you can see which sounds are currently being played . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel , there is a selection list where you can choose an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
the channel view has ( until now ) two different views to display the played sounds . in the Settings menu select Settings under the Point channel view : settings
&quot; the speed @-@ LCD shows the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tempo of a song . so , for example , if you find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows left and right from the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file containing information on how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; good , I can &apos;t force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) from &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support compiled . to fix the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example by k@@ mid ; &apos;s homepage ) &quot;
&quot; I would like to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually . &quot;
&quot; agree , support &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window . &quot;
&quot; first , enable the setting Automatic Add to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; you can press the arrow key left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down playback . to restore the default tempo , you can double @-@ click on the LCD . &quot;
I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; Desktop a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a Kara@@ oke file ) or tack@@ ed ( if I play a Kara@@ oke file ) or tack@@ ed ( if I play a Kara@@ oke file ) only in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; move the desired file into the &amp; k@@ mid window ; pull .
&quot; if you only want to listen to a file quickly without adding them to a collection , switch the setting Automatic Add to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid . first you just want to play the first file . so , set the setting Automatic Add to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file . &quot;
then you decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
&quot; these people sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , it anim@@ ates me , further to &amp; k@@ mid ; to program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; laga ( Spain ) . I study mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; laga . at the moment I am not much free for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take a bit of time . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kara@@ oke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es &quot;
&quot; if you send me a postcard or a MI@@ DI@@ - / Kara@@ oke file from a local group . if you send me a postcard or a MIDI file , you should contact me , as I may have the file already . &quot;
&quot; I have written &amp; k@@ mid , written completely in my spare time and does not get money from anyone for that . I would like to emphasize that I only continue program@@ ing because / when I receive feedback from users ( postcards or emails ) . &quot;
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - De@@ aling the defect that the pitch was too high for AW@@ E cards .
&quot; thank you Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing G@@ US support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia for testing AW@@ E support , H@@ as Pet@@ ter Bi@@ ek@@ er , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Magn@@ us pepper , Ur@@ ko L@@ usa , Peter @-@ Paul Witt@@ a , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ thei@@ der , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , error notification or even a suppor@@ tive email . &quot;
&quot; and of course , my thanks also applies to all these excellent musicians on the web , giving us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ a@@ oke files . &quot;
&quot; in addition to that &amp; k@@ mid ; also found on his homepage , which is located under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mi@@ d.@@ html . you can also find links to sites with other kar@@ a@@ oke songs , &amp; etc ; &quot;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it &apos;s not the same as you use a FM radio or an AW@@ E card .
&quot; if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you must compile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL , it will run as if you have a sound card , except that you cannot hear any music . &quot;
&quot; if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me . &quot;
&quot; &amp; KM@@ Player ; is a simple user interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files supported by M@@ Player or phon@@ on formats , as well as to play DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera . &quot;
the Docum@@ entation for &amp; k@@ app@@ ame ; was not finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this machine .
&quot; for additional help , please check the page The K@@ DE website to new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; user mailing list . &quot;
&quot; the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is the window with the playlist . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to save the preferred connections under the Book@@ marks menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category &quot; &quot; Perman@@ ent playlist &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarch@@ ical level . if you select an entry , its group and all its sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and the playback starts with the associated entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , TV and permanent playlist can also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do this if &amp; KM@@ Player ; not running . simply click on a name of a category , then select from the View menu and as next editing mode . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , you need to select the same with playlist from the menu and select either the editor mode , or select another category . &quot;
all changes will be lost if the editor mode leaves or another group is selected without the same playlist .
&quot; because of the convenience of the author of &amp; KM@@ Player , some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files . &quot;
the animation when starting and ending can be de@@ activated by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c and changing &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ last option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present it can be simply inserted .
it is also possible to enable another animation . &amp; KM@@ Player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation while starting doesn &apos;t need to be short , it will automatically end by opening another source . this would be disturbing at the end animation , the user can therefore end the application a second time . &quot;
&quot; a simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite photo : &amp; lt ; ; lt ; &amp; lt ; body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; /
&quot; there is a tab to configure M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; here , the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things can be set . &quot;
another tool for troubleshooting is the console &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of KM@@ Player . here the output of mp@@ layer can be seen .
&quot; there is no tab for this playback device in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; . everything must be configured using manual editing of the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c file , such as a flash with the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module : &quot;
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; KM@@ Player ; it can even be added to the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
&quot; to allow the &amp; KM@@ Player to play &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; KM@@ Player must be specified as service provider for the Mim@@ e type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the configuration dialog file assignments of K@@ DE . &quot;
&quot; Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; KM@@ Player ; can be started in a console application and search for error messages related to loading the browser module library . if there are no errors , the Back@@ end Edition is within &amp; KM@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu to check ) . &quot;
&quot; so that always a pre @-@ defined back@@ end for a particular mim@@ e type is taken ( of course only if this is determined ) , this must be done by changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c . for example , phon@@ on should play all o@@ gg files : &quot;
&quot; &amp; KM@@ Player ; can be played by TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be watched , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually . &quot;
&quot; for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( Video Data Rec@@ order ) settings in the KM@@ Player , the dialog in the Settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port should be detected . &quot;
&quot; since the V@@ DR support of KM@@ Player can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this type of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the video for@@ lin@@ ux extension must be supported for the X server . therefore , the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must contain the following in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig . &quot;
&quot; in the time of the emergence of this documentation , dv@@ d@@ na@@ v@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . when enabled , they begin playing the playlist . &quot;
are there hints how I can qui@@ eter my CD@@ ROM drive when I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom can be run as root after the device has been inserted . it is essential to make sure / dev / c@@ drom shows the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;
x@@ ine starts only slowly but why does each time my CPU has to be tested for its performance ?
&quot; note : the answer is outdated . k@@ x@@ in@@ ep@@ layer automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU . &quot;

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional font application . under Unix @-@ like systems it is likely to use the package &amp; tex@@ live ; respectively &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
&quot; most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution . for installation , the documentation of the distribution and installation CD / DVD should be used . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Ki@@ le ; -@@ Project includes some pre @-@ compiled packages from &amp; Ki@@ le , for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the box ; website . &quot;
&quot; this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experiences with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; Ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; . &quot;
&quot; advanced users hardly have to read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation are considered . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact information should be made via the Ki@@ le ; website . &quot;
&quot; if you have any questions about or to compile &amp; Ki@@ le , please refer to the Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net mailing list . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Desktop . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this easy , immediate and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; programs . finally , the easy @-@ to @-@ use wizard , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ reference and the powerful project management . &quot;
&quot; to find out more about &amp; make ; and to learn about its possibilities , the manual to Kate should be used . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start reading the chapter with the Editor of &amp; Po@@ sters directly . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the correct pron@@ unciation : La@@ y @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex is difficult to use , a lay@@ man can also be used . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it deri@@ ves from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La M@@ port . &quot;
&quot; if there is only a good overview about &amp; lat@@ ex ; given , it is not the ultimate book . to be able to rule correctly , good books should be used for example H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : Docum@@ ent Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , 1999 . &quot;
&quot; as well as other mark@@ up languages include &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction with which the most general features such as paper format , page number@@ ing and text gr@@ asses are specified and a body with the text . the introduction contains at least the command \ \ beginning { document } and must be closed with the \ \ end { document } command . &quot;
the Quick Start Wi@@ zard of &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a useful function for the quick creation of a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the selection of the wizard ( menu ) offers some possibilities for creating the document .
&quot; document classes : this lists the type of document to be created : articles ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , &#91; book &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ all@@ cl &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ all@@ cl &#93; , projector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , foil &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user defined . &quot;
encoding : this is used to set the encoding of the system . modern systems are increasingly using the U@@ TF @-@ 8 encoding as a standard . at best U@@ TF @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for correct processing of &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used additional packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the integration they only have to be selected in the check box .
&quot; article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . they should always be used in the creation of German texts . &quot;
new users don &apos;t need to worry about this . it is merely a brief description of the functions and further information is given in the section .
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides - just like other source editors - the high@@ lighting of the commands , attitudes and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . &quot;
&quot; with the automatic completion of the environments , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) of &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically creates a blank line ( for the input of the text ) and the corresponding line for closing the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be set in the menu settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled . &quot;
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allow the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the highest and sub @-@ paragraph the bottom element ) :
&quot; in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ files the back search can be very helpful . once a DVI ; file is created , jumps &amp; ki@@ le ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ viewer to the corresponding line in &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source text . &quot;
&quot; a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as font and is next to PDF the standard output type of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools to view , convert and to print DVI ; -@@ files for different systems and devices . &quot;
&quot; when using the case search , the elements of the DVI ; file are used with the editor and as soon as an element is cli@@ cked in the DVI ; file , the corresponding section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text is cli@@ cked . &quot;
&quot; master document : this function is used in working with several files . with a master document , work is simplified with other .@@ tex files . in the use of a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set over project project settings . &quot;
quick installation : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code will be compiled and the result will be displayed automatically ( if there are no errors in the source code ) .
&quot; file monitoring : in this mode , the DVI ; file is mounted on the &quot; &quot; un@@ mounted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; system &quot; &quot; and there is no call from &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the quick construction . &quot;
&quot; when viewing the Edit tool@@ bar , the three large selection fields should be noticed . the selection fields have been developed for quick inser@@ tion of common elements into the document . the first selection field is for quick integration of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... &quot;
&quot; the selection box for further items such as keywords , R &amp; D notes or references . the available possibilities are : &quot;
&quot; name : this command creates a name for a section , image or other element . &quot;
reference : used for reference to a specified term ( select a selection field possible ) .
&quot; when using quotation , a selection list is shown with literary entries . for &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; these works only if the file belongs to a project . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; Ki@@ le ; by hand . &quot;
&quot; the last drop @-@ down box with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã e is used for defining the font size . you can specify the font sizes for the main text , the joints , etc . the following font sizes are available : &quot;
&quot; when calling &amp; Ki@@ le , two choices are available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting document type and setting the settings . 2 . the document can be written by hand . &quot;
&quot; the par@@ enth@@ eses under the command \ \ &apos; class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; sets the font file . if the font file is not set at the beginning , this can also happen in the text . &quot;
&quot; once the above source code example has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code needs to be compiled . the easiest way to do this is to use the built @-@ in menu or the quick @-@ build button . &quot;
the source code must be saved prior to comp@@ iling . &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically removes the storage .
&quot; if the document is comp@@ iling , the documentation should be searched after the errors . if it is not the case , the logging should also be taken into account . &quot;
&quot; an environment ( English environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font file 12 is created and only a few columns should have another font . &quot;
the changes are only over@@ seen within the environment ( from \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no restriction ( number ) for the changes within an environment .
&quot; there are many possibilities to specify the legi@@ bility and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , certain fon@@ ts , fat , c@@ ital@@ ics , under@@ scores , etc. can be added . these commands end either using the \ \ end command or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is valid for ital@@ ics and is closed until it is closed with \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in one sentence can be represented itali@@ c with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ rate : creates a quote in the document . the quote begins with \ \ begin { ratio } and ends with \ \ end { ratio } .
&quot; after the background to write the source code with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ mark@@ up language is displayed , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; &quot;
&quot; as soon as a bit of text has been entered in the wizard , a few adjustments should be made for the better legi@@ bility of the document . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , the editor view or C@@ tr@@ l E can be returned to the editor ( with the internal viewer ) . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI file is created , the document can be printed or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and have fun . &quot;
&quot; DVI ; is an independent file format ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi output such as printers , and Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screens . &quot;
&quot; for the printing of a &amp; DVI ; file , the same steps as for creating the document are required ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , the document can then be printed ( if the printer is set correctly ) . &quot;
&quot; the tool bar allows the conversion of the DVI ; file to other formats . once the DVI ; file was created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code , the conversion into desired other formats can begin using the buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
the preliminary search allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI file .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ bin@@ aries . only Modern under Settings box needs to be set up ... Tools building well @-@ balanced .
&quot; in order to perform the search query , the mouse po@@ inter must be positioned in a row of the source text and then be cli@@ cked on to the search query . the jump to the corresponding position in the DVI ; viewer is then carried out . &quot;
with this function in &amp; Oc@@ ular ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ document from &amp; Ki@@ le ; open and to the corresponding line . to do this &amp; Ki@@ le ; in &amp; Oc@@ ular ; set up as text editor ( Set@@ ting Settings ... Editor )
&quot; if you do not open the &amp; DVI ( or DVI ) viewer , an error may occur . if an error is available , it will be shown in the log file or in the message window . &quot;
&quot; the log file lists the source code errors . in the editor , the buttons Pre@@ vious La@@ Te@@ X errors and N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ ster La@@ Te@@ X errors can be used for jumps between errors . the logging file always indicates the line in which the error appears . to view the error line , the error must be cli@@ cked in the logging and &amp; Ki@@ le ; jumps to the error line . &quot;
&quot; when cli@@ cked on the button in the tool@@ bar , a window will appear to select the template to be used for the document . the default options are : &quot;
&quot; when selecting empty documents , a document may either be re@@ written from scratch or the wizard will be used for the quick creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; frequently users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created in &amp; Ki@@ le ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file must be opened or create a new file . &amp; Ki@@ le ; can create a new template by opening an existing document and selecting file template from document ... &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document from a template using File New , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in Settings ... &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings will be replaced by which variables : &quot;
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string will be replaced by typing in document class . typically it is used as follows : \ \ by@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { items } .
&quot; the simplest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps have to be executed : &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document , your own template can then be selected instead of the standard ones . &quot;
&quot; a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files are created . if an easy way to create a template , it should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described below . &quot;
&amp; Ki@@ le ; used &amp; Po@@ sters ; as internal editor . &amp; kate ; is a text editor for program@@ mers with the possibility of reading and high@@ lighting many different types of text files ( among them also &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) .
&quot; to find out more about &amp; make ; and its possibilities to find out , the manual to Kate should be used . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start reading the chapter with the Editor of &amp; Po@@ sters directly there . &quot;
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ command reference which can be called over the Men@@ tion La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a detailed description of almost all the commands in &amp; lat@@ ex ; they can be used as well as their syntax .
double click with pressed C@@ tr@@ l button to select the &amp; tex ; meaning that in this way clicking on \ \ par from \ \ par \ \ big@@ skip is only \ \ par .
&quot; when dra@@ gging the text with the left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
&quot; when using the arrow keys with covered Shift key , parts of the source text can be selected in the editing pane . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to browse the most different types of source texts and to emphasize them . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands from normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by another color . &quot;
&quot; many assistants can include additional ho@@ cks . this is a special type of book@@ mark within the text . the menu item Edit Ank@@ le marks or the corresponding button is highlighted , so that it is automatically deleted when entering a character . &quot;
&quot; editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as &amp; Ki@@ le ; although &amp; Po@@ sters ; already excellent opportunities , have been added to &amp; Ki@@ le ; key functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; special commands for their selection . under Edit selection , the following commands are included in the text selection : &quot;
&quot; this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands and all other lines of the source code . the only bent thing in &amp; Ki@@ le is that the paragra@@ phs are separated by two empty lines . &quot;
select the word under the current cur@@ sor position . this selection also has an extended meaning since this command also has an extended meaning ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
&quot; to delete a part of the document , this can be removed first and removed by pressing C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the whole line is removed . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers its own commands here for a faster possibility . &quot;
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; Ki@@ le ; is included in the description of the selection paragraph .
it has already been made clear that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore &amp; Ki@@ le ; for more commands under the Edit environment for a more easy work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
this command will jump to the start of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
this command will jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to protect the environment .
&quot; if the cur@@ sor is located before or within the command \ \ begin { surroundings } , it will jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering many ne@@ sted environment commands , the overview can quickly be lost . this command closes the recently opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted environment structure is not destroyed . &quot;
&amp; Ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups determined by brackets { ... } .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the cur@@ ly bracket .
this command will jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the cur@@ ly closing bracket .
if the cur@@ sor is in front of or behind the cur@@ ly brackets of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # is inj@@ ected to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
&quot; when entering many ne@@ sted cur@@ ly braces , the overview can quickly be lost . this command closes the recently opened group so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups will not be destroyed . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the &quot; &quot; sign &quot; &quot; is used in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the sign &quot; &quot; is used for two simple applications . &quot; &quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; knows this case and includes two complete instructions for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one . &quot;
this automatic setting of double quotes can be set up in Settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X will be switched on and off .
&quot; it can also be used for specific settings ( e.g. n@@ au@@ l or French ) , so that German or French call@@ ers can be used . there are also many other languages available . &quot;
&quot; when you click Shift , En@@ ter &amp; Ki@@ le ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is within a list environment ( e. g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; Ki@@ le ; not only a line break but also the \ \ item command . &quot;
the current line with \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . these can be set up under Settings box ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X added .
&quot; some users want to arrange the columns in tables - environments , and all E@@ t signs ( amp ; ) among each other . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; Po@@ sters ; already a good source code completion , this has been extended in &amp; Ki@@ le ; for special commands ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) , three different modes are built for automatic completion . all these modes can be set up for different ways of working under Settings ... &quot;
when starting a new environment by command \ \ begin { surroundings } &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } after an empty line ( for text ) .
&quot; when selecting the back button , the last letter of the input is removed and the completion list is possible . on the other hand , the list can also be reduced by entering another letter . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions will be removed by selecting a command . alternatively , jump stamps can be inserted , so that an easy jump to these positions is possible by using jump @-@ marks N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ ste jumping brand and the desired parameters can then be inserted . &quot;
&quot; under Settings box ; set up ... box ; Complete settings can be made to these lists . you can select different bet@@ ter@@ lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ orders , as well as native speakers of the general language used . &quot;
&quot; the command mode is not useful for exec@@ uting environments . there must always be a few letters with \ \ begin to begin and the call of completion mode will result in a large e @-@ list with environment commands . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; Ki@@ le ; a special mode for completing environments . &quot;
&quot; when calling the completion mode over the Men@@ tion Edi@@ ting environment or key Shift key + Shift key , the command to open the environment is automatically added and it appears \ \ begin { . after that , the environment can be continued in the simplest way and terminated by pressing the input button . &quot;
&quot; once this is done , the environment will be closed automatically . once &amp; Ki@@ le ; detects that it is a list environment , a first \ \ item command will be added . &quot;
&quot; under Settings box ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; Complete settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the list of completion mode for &amp; tex , - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; supports custom lists of abbrevi@@ ations , which are immediately replaced by longer strings . the lists can be set up under Settings box ... Ki@@ le Ver@@ sions can be set up . as an example of a query list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which for example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included . &quot;
&quot; for example , if the letter L is entered and the word per@@ emp@@ tive mode is introduced over the Men@@ Ã ¼ editing folder or key C@@ tr@@ l + Alt space bar , the letter L is replaced by the character chain \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot;
&quot; large @-@ scale wells are not helpful for automatic completion . however , it has been found that many cases are written more than once in a document . this provides &amp; Ki@@ le ; the completion for all W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ters already written . &quot;
this mode can be set up in the Settings box ... boxes can be shut down . here the threshold value for the display of completion can also be specified .
&quot; the exec@@ uting files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / ki@@ le / complete / fashion / the Persian home folder . mode stands for abbrevi@@ ation ( abbrevi@@ ation ) , dictionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex . &quot;
&quot; the dialog graphics are designed to create graphics as easy as possible . to view the basics of graphics formats , the sections should be considered and considered . &quot;
&quot; PS files are not as popular as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for changes and re@@ arrangement of pages . if the PDF output is used , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file . &quot;
&quot; to view the results of the work , the source code needs to be compiled . all building tools are group@@ ed in groups in the Cre@@ ate compilation , Imple@@ menting and Cre@@ ating View . &quot;
&quot; for comp@@ iling the source text for viewer and ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used by pressing Alt ; 2 . afterwards , the DVI ; file can be converted to a PS file using old ; 4 the DVI ; file can be viewed in a PS file and viewed using Alt ; 5 the PS file . &quot;
&quot; when using the Quick Start command , a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if no embedded viewer is used , a new window will open each time . &quot;
a new project will be published about the project Neues Projekt .... This includes the following information for the project :
&quot; when selecting the fil@@ en@@ ame window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file . &quot;
the script function of &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows to execute EC@@ MA@@ Script code . scripts can be managed across scripts in vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet fully developed and can be used in other versions of &amp; Ki@@ le .
&quot; first , it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; Ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = ki@@ le ) with the following methods has : &quot;
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a well @-@ developed system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different help to support users .
&quot; &amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; are delivered with many documents , including documentation for the included packages and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference . &quot;
&quot; this is not just a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather a complete manual for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands contain and is therefore ideal for searching for a specific format@@ ting . as this is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; ki@@ le ; in three important book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; delivered , finding the right document is not always easy . as a possible help , &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , containing a database with all the items to &amp; Ki@@ le ; delivered documents and there@@ for a graphical surface area . &quot;
all documents are divided into categories and the biggest advantage is the search for package names or keywords . from &amp; Ki@@ le ; only the results will be displayed .
double @-@ clicking with the mouse or the space bar opens the viewer for the document .
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ fted and user @-@ friendly &amp; lat@@ ex ; - / tex ; -@@ source editor , which can be executed on all systems with installed &amp; chew@@ ed ; - and Unix @-@ like systems . &amp; Ki@@ le ; is also a part of the Fink project , whereby &amp; Ki@@ le ; also on &amp; Mac ; can be executed with OS @-@ X installed . &quot;
many thanks to those who are striving for the continued existence of &amp; Ki@@ le ; we want to sacrifice for many hours for the development of tools that we all can use under observ@@ ance of the &amp; GNU ; -@@ license . up @-@ to @-@ date information on the contribut@@ ors is available in the Men@@ orca Help Centre .

&quot; &amp; k@@ sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different signatures for emails . with the command @-@ line interface , you create random signatures or day signatures from a list . this command @-@ line interface provides the signatures for external email programs like &amp; k@@ mail ; &quot;
&quot; for random signatures , any signature from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig is read out . by many signatures with different quotes , styles and information , you can make your e @-@ mails varied and unique . &quot;
&quot; for day signatures , the same signature from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig is read for the whole day . for each day you use different signatures , as with the random signatures you create unique emails . &quot;
&quot; to create a new signature , select C@@ tr@@ l ; N file New . this gives you an lt ; empty signature ; in the Sig@@ natur@@ es section . if you have entered your signature , save it with C@@ tr@@ l ; S File Save or click the Save icon . &quot;
&quot; you can create as many signatures as you like . then you have a list of signatures for email programs like &amp; k@@ mail ; . whether you use e @-@ mails privately or professionally , there are always enough signatures . &quot;
&quot; to delete a signature , select it first and then in the File menu Rem@@ ove or click on the icon with the red cross Rem@@ ove in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; to change a short command , select an action from the list . to change a short command , select an action from the list . &quot;

&quot; anyone who worked with the &amp; k@@ de , knows my pro@@ c and how outstanding it is . let &apos;s take it a bit , we give it a graphical interface ! no more dependent on a terminal ; simply click the symbol for the XML processor and done ! &quot;
&quot; this application expects a inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is in the bold working folder , then let the current working folder be attached . if not , then remove the selection of the current working folder and enter the desired folder in the field of other folders . &quot;
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files are deleted every time my@@ pro@@ c is started .
&quot; as already said , everyone who has worked on the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has already worked , knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there is now a great graphical interface for this . &quot;
&quot; if the newly opened file inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is , simply select the current working folder . if not , select the current working folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is available . &quot;
&quot; when it comes to an output on the screen , your file is fla@@ wed . please check the reported errors and try again . &quot;
&quot; if the file to be checked already is marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; , then they are simply attached to the current file . if not , they delete the tick and select the file to be reviewed by other file - file selection . &quot;
&quot; if you only want to know if the well @-@ formed file is , click Well @-@ formed Check Sel@@ ection . &quot;
&quot; for use of a &amp; DT@@ D ; set in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( internal ) ( default ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( external ) and specify the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; i.e. for the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema as well as for the Relax@@ NG check is the definition of the definition UR@@ I ; in the file selection . &quot;
&quot; yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; has also a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library . &quot;
&quot; if the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; already selected , then the current file is simply selected . if not , remove the current file and select the file to be processed by the other file selection file . &quot;
&quot; enter the name of the file , as the result is to have named , and the file is normally stored in its home folder . &quot;
&quot; the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; l@@ ends , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even possibly little to do . therefore , the plug @-@ in system is very powerful . you can benefit from the additional functionality immediately and do not have to wait until someone uses the desired in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements . &quot;
&quot; to install a plug @-@ in or a part , start with the Edit menu . this will open the following dialog : &quot;
this dialog allows you to manage all plu@@ gins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plu@@ gins without a location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this path to the search of the plug @-@ in .
often work on a project several persons in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured using Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and is used for clear identification .
&quot; one member may have several roles in the project , such as team leaders and sub @-@ project leaders . &quot;
the user can choose from the list of team members who he is . this happens by searching the team member from the list and pressing the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( their identi@@ ties ) will appear bold after you are : text .
nick@@ names and the setting of their own identity are important with regard to news and ann@@ ot@@ ations . see for further information on ann@@ ot@@ ations .
&quot; in addition to the overview of their team , there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team : it can be created an event for information to team leaders when something is happening . see for further information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that are executed when something particular happens in the project . an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project , so that later , how much someone was working on it or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that will insert a file into CVS , as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; on the page Event Con@@ figuration of the Shift , F@@ 7 Project Pre@@ ferences dialog can be created , edited and deleted events . &quot;
an email is sent to the add@@ res@@ sees selected in the recipient list . the add@@ res@@ see can be a team or sub @-@ project leader . see how such conductors can be set up .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
you can either select the note entry from the Editor context menu or enter the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment area followed by comment text .
&quot; comments can be sent to a defining member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( R@@ ole ) , where nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the team member , plays a role in the project . &quot;
nick@@ names and roles names are independent of upper or lower case letters but spaces around the brackets and the : make the note invalid .
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for scrip@@ t- and format@@ ting languages , the DT@@ D @-@ agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages . &quot;
&quot; the settings can be reached via the Settings menu . here , only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in . &quot;
the settings can be set up using settings Qu@@ anta ... called . this dialog extends over a number of pages that are treated one after the other .
&quot; the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; concerning tags including car completion , it can be changed . the entries are : &quot;
&quot; large / lower case of tags : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically added tags . normal big / lower case , the tags are inserted in the way they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; large / sp@@ elling of attributes : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically added attributes . normal bulk / lower case , the attributes are inserted in the way they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; optional tags automatically include : if checked , for tags , for which the closing tag is optional , this will be inserted immediately after the &amp; gt ; &quot;
&quot; do not include optional tags : as above , for all other tags with the exception of simple tags . &quot;
&quot; automatically update start and finish tag : if enabled , the corresponding closing tag will be changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic replacement of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ent characters into the corresponding coding while typing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for the detection of different types of files . using the Def@@ ault button the standard specifications can be restored .
&quot; standard character encoding : encoding of newly created or otherwise opened files ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . however , this setting is removed from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; standard DT@@ D : the chosen DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not recognized . &quot;
&quot; create backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; creates backup copies regularly , so in case of a power failure or crash when the next start of the program the document can be restored from this backup . &quot;
&quot; previ@@ ew@@ ing and docum@@ enting can be displayed either in the Editor area or in one &apos;s own view ( or the documentation in a tab ) , which makes it possible to look at the documentation , preview and source code at the same time . &quot;
set the window settings back to the default in the next start is useful when the user interface is crossed by changing the M@@ DI modes and do@@ cking / dis@@ connecting views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters .
the warning message area is used to control the display of warnings by hooks of non @-@ request .
the place to change behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as synchron@@ ization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and source text view in shared mode . see the different modes see .
&quot; here , the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which represents the figure of the par@@ ser no@@ des in the document , can be set in details . &quot;
&quot; in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons . &quot;
&quot; in the area of structure tree settings , the visibility of knots in the tree , the update frequency of the tree during editing and how deep in a change in the structure tree is to be opened automatically . empty groups are the empty spaces in the text , while empty groups are those in which no element was found in the current document . &quot;
&quot; abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s . abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s . this means there may be a valid group for PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ ender abbrevi@@ ation means something else than in a group valid for Javascript . &quot;
&quot; plug @-@ ins are K@@ Part applications from third side , which can be re@@ used by any K@@ Part @-@ capable application , on the most known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified : &quot;
address : the path to the plugin if it is not located at a standard such as $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
&quot; input : this information is given to the plug @-@ in at startup , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
load Only @-@ Read Only mode : check if the plug @-@ in den@@ ies the store . only @-@ Read @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse loading if this option is not selected .
&quot; check the plug @-@ in : if this is enabled , then test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if the given information is correct . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from version 3.3 , troubleshooting has been completely re@@ developed . the support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ u@@ gger has been set , as well as the support for the DB@@ G de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a Deb@@ u@@ gger plugin concept has been implemented that allows different implement@@ ations of plug @-@ ins . &quot;
&quot; currently , only one plugin is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; insert . &quot;
&quot; the use of the Deb@@ u@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plugin in the project settings . with the Options button next to the Deb@@ u@@ gger plugin , the specific settings can be changed . &quot;
&quot; if a de@@ bu@@ gger is activated for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; user interface : &quot;
a view in which the contents of monitored variables are displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
&quot; a view in which all holding points , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower dock . &quot;
a view in which the output ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . usually appears in the lower dock .
&quot; depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; this action triggers the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger , if required , or tells the plug @-@ in to listen to de@@ bu@@ gger requirements . this action is fired by default when a project is opened that needs a de@@ bu@@ gger so that normally it is not necessary to pay attention to it . &quot;
the counterpart to Deb@@ u@@ gger &apos;s session starts the session . closes the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the sounds according to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to send a de@@ bug request . this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request will be displayed in the Deb@@ u@@ gger output .
&quot; instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and continuously send information about the monitored variables as well as the current executed row . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will continue . if it happens before a de@@ bu@@ gger is started , the script starts with the request . &quot;
&quot; when this happens while a script is stopped , the execution continues . if it happens before a de@@ bu@@ gger is given , the execution begins as soon as a request is made . &quot;
the de@@ bu@@ gger performs the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include .
&quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger performs the next instruction in the script , where possible when possible in functions and include . &quot;
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to skip the statement and go to the next one as if there is not the current one .
opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered that should be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
&quot; with this dialog , you can enter a variable or set a new value of a variable . &quot;

this chapter describes how you can adapt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; adapt to your needs and how you can help &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; help to get better .
&quot; document type Edi@@ ting Pack@@ ages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; they allow &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; capabilities like car completion and c@@ rest rooms . they allow &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ bar . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ bar . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ bar . tag folders are handy , symbolic buttons of image buttons ( above the editing window ) , insert text and instructions more quickly into a document than a user could ever . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see for details on conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; . &quot;
tag XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the properties dialog . the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars enable quick inser@@ tion of tags into a document without the risk of a write error .
&quot; tag folders are nothing but a folder . they only contain the file descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder bears the name of the description language and version , so there . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of the tag XML and declares whether they are necessary , or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information in working with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about possibilities and limits is presented in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of a tag XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains only one element type about yourself otherwise nothing . &quot;
the type of tag is a script function . when used &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
valid only for class class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
valid only for the type method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the tag has a common attribute group and the attributes within that tag can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 ) &quot;
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a only element type element .
&quot; this element can only occur once for each attribute . it defines the name and type of attribute . additionally , there are other tags describing how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a only element type element . &quot;
speci@@ fies the source texts used to fill in the tag editor dialog and attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to achieve source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to achieve the data source .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface and method name . the arguments passed to the method can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tag . &quot;
a container tag that group@@ ed the elements of a list together . it can occur only once for an attribute description . it is a only element type element .
speci@@ fies the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag can only occur for each attribute in a dialog only once ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
speci@@ fies the position and size of a field in dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each and lt ; att@@ r &gt; and lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this item is empty .
a list of elements that may occur within the tags to be defined . this element is a only element type .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that end a day . this element is a single element type .
&quot; all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly cha@@ ined , and closed . &quot;
&quot; spaces should be replaced by &amp; lt ; and &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; text &gt; will not cause a break , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
&quot; to verify the tag XML files , the tools dialog at the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ window should start and check tag X@@ ML@@ . a further dialog will appear , whose simple instructions are to follow . &quot;
&quot; this function is currently not available . currently , the check is done only when the tag XML files are loaded in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us . &quot;
in the following example for a family 1 tag XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this tag XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
the following is an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this tag XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&quot; &amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; &quot; 1.0 &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; &quot; &gt; &amp; lt ; ! doc@@ type tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; function &quot; re@@ turn@@ Type = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt; &quot;
the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor available via DT@@ D Edit DT@@ D settings . this allows di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a new &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a new &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; should be created with the following entries :
&quot; &#91; general &#93; Version = Use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D statement . ( - / / W3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Ni@@ ck@@ name = The simplified name of the DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name . &quot;
an action can be set with settings actions ... click New Action leads to the same dialog :
&quot; the button abbrevi@@ ation assigned to this action . by clicking on the user @-@ defined button , you can assign a short@@ cut to the keyboard ; with K@@ 1 , the current keyboard short@@ cut can be removed . &quot;
&quot; the simplest actions . a text can be entered in the detailed settings and in the execution of the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below . &quot;
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) can be started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; themselves are the Quick Start dialog or the various Read in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML D@@ TE@@ Ps . &quot;
&quot; first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . This way , the script tries to find : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in its path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in the command line : &quot;
% f : we are replacing with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file : / from the document name is removed .
% p@@ id : will be replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; only one instance will be added to the P@@ ID number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; it is used by the external script .
&quot; the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the above mentioned methods , a script input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us can be used ; in the input field input can be determined , which is to be sent to the default input . &quot;
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
&quot; according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , which is written to the standard output ; error messages are directed to the default output , by setting the value the selection field output : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create your own tool@@ bar for each group . in any case , it is not too many , therefore you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the marker . &quot;
&quot; once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . &quot;
the parts of this window are rather self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window opens the editing mode .
fill out all necessary fields and add the tag to the appropriate tool@@ bar .
&quot; complete everything and , if the tag has attributes and you plan to use it , enable &quot; Edit Tag &quot; dialog when available , so that input when using the action is possible . &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is that a ugly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? replace it before we have difficulty .
&quot; to create a symbol that represents the action better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; choose from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphi@@ c Other Program@@ s ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels by default , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit Size . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created symbol does not only help you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to the day start , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is mostly called loose , star@@ te , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ aled that clicking on this symbol is started ; -@@ tag in the current document will be inserted . &quot;
&quot; after creating the symbol it must be connected with the action . this happens through the menu with Settings actions setting ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and select the desired action . in addition to the text box , there is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder in which the stored icon is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the Apply button and continue with other tags , if there are any , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot;
suppose you want some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; add functions to the tool@@ bar or it should be shared to a better overview by some separ@@ ators into multiple groups . open the tool@@ bar dialog via Settings Tool@@ bar . make sure the tool bar you want is selected .
&quot; after selecting the element that is to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I would like to have a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
please note how dis@@ connecting support group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool@@ bar could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by using all symbols to ensure that everything works .
&quot; after New@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created im@@ pedi@@ ments , but your tool bar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder . please adjust its &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that your tool bar ( s ) will be loaded ( s ) when a file is opened by the corresponding type . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the most notable addition to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language that you like best . that &apos;s why this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use . &quot;
&quot; before starting your own documentation , you might be able to check in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; repository , whether someone has done it for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you need to search an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . &quot;
&quot; # Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html section 2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html section 2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html section 2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html section 2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html section 2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html section 2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html section 2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html section 2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html section 2 = day 1.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 3.@@ html &quot;
&quot; the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can now see in the &amp; PHP documentation : &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ... &quot;
note the # from Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the shaft depth ( except through reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the contents directory is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
spaces affect nothing but make sure to &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; resources files are replaced .
&quot; for example , when writing a &amp; PHP script , the documentation should be displayed directly for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function . by selecting the function name and pressing C@@ tr@@ l ; H for context help , the documentation would appear directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file connector lines . &quot;
&quot; a simple list of separated context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) . &quot;
now you can easily save your do@@ cr@@ c file and add to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( just how you entered your do@@ cr@@ c file ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
&quot; if you are sure that these are good and worth sharing , send your do@@ cr@@ c files to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; community . you won &apos;t get rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the failing resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; the resources can be sent by e @-@ mail to friends , partners or otherwise . at various locations there is an email @-@ sending menu entry , such as the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) sending mail , tool bar tool bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the scrip@@ ted tree . &quot;
&quot; resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all others &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; users can download them . the contributions are checked and only made available when our team uses them as correct and useful for publication . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading , you will be asked for your private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event that you have multiple keys , you can choose one . in the New Resources menu , the input fields have to be filled ( URL preview can remain empty ) and click OK to start up@@ loading . &quot;
&quot; up@@ loading can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) menus , upload tool bar tool@@ bars , and start from the contex@@ tual menu of files and folders in the template and scrip@@ ted tree . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , before installation , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing . in case of problems it warns and it can then be canc@@ eled . if integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears with the statement of the origin@@ ator of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work on XML language that is currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; however , creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files in tag@@ XML format might be necessary . &quot;
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D Lo@@ ad menu and converting a DT@@ D . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description that should be used . after that the following dialog appears :
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! Doc@@ type Defini@@ tions line : the string that appears in ! Doc@@ type tag like HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e@@ .d@@ t@@ d should appear
&quot; fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when activated , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; after converting the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there are some key concepts . in order to understand these and full benefits from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , one must first famili@@ ari@@ ze themselves with these fundamental concepts without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction involves a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for everyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; all that is selected as global is stored in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this allows the group of administrators to secure various tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which will then be available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment on the system . &quot;
local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a particular project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS ; patterns to tool@@ bars with special actions especially for the files of a particular project .
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of several main areas : the editor window , the building man@@ ors , the cart@@ els with information and the tool@@ bars . please check in , and for more detailed information about these areas . &quot;
&quot; click the right mouse button to get a contex@@ tual menu with the current document , such as closing , re@@ charging , del@@ eting or up@@ loading the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CVS commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right @-@ click in the Editor area leads to another context menu related to the edited document content , such as basic processing steps ( cut / paste / paste ) , editing the tag under the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor , or opening the file , if the string under the mouse po@@ inter refers to a file . &quot;
&quot; at the upper end of the editor window are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and related user requirements . &quot;
&quot; the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if they want to insert one simple tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; p@@ gt ; in your document , then click on the tag that represents the tag . if it is a day that has multiple attributes ( such as anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in a dialog with different fields . &quot;
&quot; the building man@@ ors ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow you to navigate , open and browse them in the information about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us . in the presentation with cart@@ on filters are available for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right click . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting the files from the storage media can be done with the contex@@ tual menu displayed . &quot;
&quot; another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories depending on which context they are used . global templates are always available , local templates only available for the appropriate user and templates in projects can only be used in the project . &quot;
&quot; here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retrieve the available information to a script . &quot;
&quot; this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cur@@ sor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by clicking on an element , a list of commands opens in relation to navigation and refres@@ her of the tree . &quot;
&quot; this tree appears under the other tree views . with it , man@@ quick attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces can change . the entry system aligned to the content allows the change of all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation on web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &apos; Docum@@ entation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project , project @-@ specific documentation can be app@@ ended , edited and viewed . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two tab@@ s at the bottom of the window can be accessed via the useful information : the message window and the problem window . &quot;
this tab displays information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to the DT@@ D are displayed .
this tab displays all errors in the current document &apos;s mark@@ up . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; scripts that are executed give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; tool bars are extensively extended and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command displayed . the chocolate side of the tool@@ bar is the possibility to define own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
&quot; another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a tool bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if you receive a tool@@ bar in an email , you can secure it in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; like any other store and load ! &quot;
&quot; it is reasonable if you want to customize the place of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for that auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , specify . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you have problems when starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should ensure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in PAT@@ H in front of its bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
&quot; while trying to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a stand @-@ alone , exten@@ sible mark@@ up language editor ? well , this would make it the most magnificent web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summari@@ zed : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for it the appropriate &amp; IDE ; be . &quot;
&quot; now , to the above claim must be noted that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; development community based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; following , in good application of free software , the idea of Why Develop@@ ing what someone else has developed , but it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to expand how they need it for their needs . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; allows web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation can increase dramatically . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for a fast web development , and quickly became a mature editor with many powerful functions . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; for more detailed documentation , help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or help help : / Qu@@ anta ) . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and looked after by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; a quick list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , and the oldest entry will be removed . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use . if you are trying to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported . &quot;
&quot; when inser@@ ting from the cli@@ p@@ board there are special characters for &amp; HTML ; -@@ sp@@ elling , so that they are displayed correctly and cannot be mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instruction . &quot;
&quot; converts the text from cli@@ p@@ board to &amp; URL , which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . first and foremost for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s into the anchor tag . &quot;
switches the block selection to / from . this allows you to select text blocks using the Shift + Shift key .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if you &amp; PHP ; -@@ Script reports error messages !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window in which you see the display of scripts and de@@ bu@@ gger .
the problem re@@ porter is activated as soon as you switch to the structure tree .
displays the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
&quot; if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with entries Pre@@ vious or Next , depending on the position of the cur@@ sor in the document . &quot;
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu according to the file name of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
&quot; searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this allows you to copy video files into your project folder , or sub@@ folder , and then add them to the project . &quot;
loads the files in your project on the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; from and if you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
&quot; settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the project manages . in the chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; projects you will find the details . &quot;
loads a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in project Dir / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool bar . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
open a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this creates only the name . actions must be set by settings actions ... or you will be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bars .
&quot; remove a tool@@ bar from the field of view . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar yet , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do that . &quot;
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; team so that the tool@@ bar is available in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as app@@ endi@@ x .
enables up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server where everyone else can access it . see in .
invite one &amp; DT@@ D ; you or anyone else has made and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; own description format .
load / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be refresh@@ ed without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; refresh . if this is global and does not exist a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder fails the load .
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags available in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar . &quot;
allows access to the current Tag dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags menu followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus .
&quot; currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ tion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; inser@@ ting by tool bar is denied if this day is contrary to the rules . &quot;
&quot; in the plug @-@ ins menu , the available plu@@ gins are listed under the menu items mentioned above . click on it . clicking on an activated plug @-@ in will be disabled . &quot;
select the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schemes depends on the type ; version .
&quot; very useful when you know people using other OS platforms to develop . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Mac@@ intosh . &quot;
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
&quot; instant switching between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in K@@ DE libraries , switching can sometimes take time or create un@@ attractive graphics . it is recommended that the flash@@ card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub @-@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub@@ window . selecting an entry will enable the appropriate sub@@ window . &quot;
to@@ g@@ gles the status bar to the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window .
changes in this dialog affect any application using the K@@ HTML part including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
&quot; judge the behavior of the editor window . in the Docum@@ entation of Po@@ sters , you will find details . &quot;
a dialog appears where you can delete entries from the tool@@ bars or add or modify the sequences .
&quot; this should generate a help according to the environment of the mouse @-@ po@@ inter , but is not implemented yet . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; development in financial form , they find here the way . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should preferably be completed from top to bottom , for example after completing the project name , the entire directory structure will be completed automatically for the rest of the project . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file will be filled automatically . &quot;
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; project file . by default it has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case letters and without spaces with the extension WEB@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
&quot; here you can specify the server address of the machine you want to access , unless you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ buffer ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected log will be used . depending on the remote host setting , an adjustment could be necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder in which the templates are saved for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default . if a common collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder in which the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
this allows to insert files from the local file system into the project . you can select multiple files or entire folders .
&quot; this setting is great if you have static web content that you want to download and change . in server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc . ) you have to proceed differently . &quot;
&quot; if files , which are located somewhere in the main folder of the project , can be attached . if a project is started from scratch , not hooks . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all files and folders are displayed within the main folder and you can make a precise selection of good man@@ di@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by hook or , by removing the tick , clips from the project . &quot;
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded in the menu with project project properties in the menu tree in the sub @-@ window profiles or changed using the Shift @-@ F@@ 7 key .
some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in . additional entries are explained below .
&quot; a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholders are possible ) , which can be re @-@ read in project @-@ related operations such as project folders . &quot;
&quot; additional option to the top , including files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the project view , which is loaded when you open the project . in addition , you can read more about project views . &quot;
this allows you to select the desired de@@ bu@@ gger . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the Deb@@ u@@ gger plugin can be set with the Options button .
&quot; in the lower @-@ window profiles , high @-@ loading profiles ( see in ) can be set as well as the display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile , by cont@@ acting your own tree view for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the sub @-@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details . &quot;
&quot; event configurations can be switched on and add , change or delete event actions . event actions are executed when a pre @-@ defined event occurs , such as viewing a file . see the details . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the last project that was opened . this behavior is not currently affected . &quot;
&quot; to open another project , select Project Open Project ... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will open and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; closed , the project file will be saved automatically . you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project . &quot;
the project manager gives free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
&quot; folder beha@@ ves similarly , but the entries are missing opening and opening with ... in the right @-@ click context menu : &quot;
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
&quot; to remove the current profile . if there is only one profile available , the button will be da@@ zz@@ led to prevent the removal . &quot;
&quot; the password will be kept in the core memory , and forget about program@@ mers . this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather uns@@ af@@ e password on the disk is not possible . &quot;
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , many high @-@ load profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed : &quot;
this is the name of the server on which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
&quot; the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de , and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs . &quot;
&quot; the port for the transfer . normally this does not have to be changed , except the network administrator does not run a service on the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your fear threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it at your discretion . the password is stored on the disk so it cannot be read easily , but everyone with knowledge can easily see it in plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is only one set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in a project , i.e. by simply do@@ cking the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; views can be saved , opened or deleted in the menu project or the project tool@@ bar , accessible via Settings Tool@@ bar project tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , with which to do most . this helps not only increase productivity , but also allows the custom@@ ization of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to their own way of working . &quot;
&quot; as mentioned above , tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us are best stack@@ able via the tool@@ bar menu . &quot;
&quot; tool@@ bars and symbols can be set either by means of context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which new action , a new tool@@ bar can be created , which can be executed in the dialog , where the actions on this or other tool@@ bars should be visible . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , additional entries will be removed and action edited , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the tool@@ bars and actions on them can set up in the menu with Settings Tool@@ bars ... and set Settings ... set .
&quot; templates are basically document skel@@ et@@ ons , code sni@@ pp@@ ets and files to link . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you can copy , move or link any existing directory into the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in about the limitations you imagine for the file system . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supplied templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use .
&quot; binary templates are usually included in documents using links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . more information on the Tem@@ plate tree is available . &quot;
&quot; documents can be written by any text document type . on the basis of these templates new documents can be created . normally , more specialized documents can be created in appropriate sub@@ folders . &quot;
&quot; these types of templates are useful if not a new document should always be included in the documents based on a template but the same text area . you can find everything from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl basis . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . see in for more information on the templates tree . &quot;
&quot; as the name says , these templates serve as templates for whole web sites . they are a collection of various documents organized in a folder structure , summari@@ zed in a compressed tar archive . currently , there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us . &quot;
&quot; create a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book , etc . ) and select File As a template saving as a local template .... &quot;
&quot; once this has been done , you will notice that ( even if it is stored as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . &quot;
&quot; select Text in your document and click File As a template save selection as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can easily be dra@@ gged with drag and drop to the tree view templates . &quot;
&quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . all file management functions can be used for it , such as dra@@ gging and inser@@ ting or inser@@ ting via the Con@@ quer@@ or file tree . &quot;
&quot; you can click on a folder to the right in the file tree or in the project files , select a name for the template and back up . by default , it is saved in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template . &quot;
&quot; project templates allow a very goal @-@ oriented approach . you can pre @-@ enter he@@ aders and foot@@ ers , or dynamically with &amp; PHP ; design , insert files or link them with them . additionally , you can keep a few things in mind when using templates in projects . &quot;
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates .
&quot; to specify the behavior of a folder , right @-@ click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears : &quot;
&quot; a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . &quot;
&quot; in case of a normal folder , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text module . if nothing appears , you will probably be in a root folder . &quot;
allows pre@@ defined or copied text for templates in this folder . this might be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a particular project and allows you to equi@@ p a whole presentation with the matching he@@ aders / foot@@ ers by copying content templates in a folder with special he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
&quot; in addition , you have the contex@@ tual menu ( show right mouse button ) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and past@@ ing templates from one place to another . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; provides two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor , which is accessible via the View menu . the first mode replaces the source text editor in two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor . &quot;
&quot; the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and a cur@@ sor appears . then you can edit and edit the source code editor if necessary , in which the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor are visible in the source code . &quot;
&quot; in working with the V@@ PL ; editor in a document , which &amp; PHP ; contains , a small green symbol shows the default of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . to edit &amp; PHP ; there are no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works exactly like the first , except that simultaneously the changes both in the source editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor synchron@@ ized . &quot;
&quot; the synchron@@ isation distance between the V@@ PL , Editor and the source text editor can be set up using settings Qu@@ anta . depending on the choice of V@@ PL , you can choose between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . &quot;
&quot; assuming you want to change the title of the website , you will be able to select document properties . the document properties dialog is also called as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; editor . &quot;
&quot; met@@ a @-@ tags allow storing information about the document itself e.g. keywords for internet search engines . met@@ a @-@ elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . one click on the list allows to change the content , e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the content column . &quot;
CSS rules are the new way to design the pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons under the list . a change over the list is just as possible with the met@@ a elements . editing of CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file @-@ open button and selecting the appropriate file .
&quot; use of cur@@ sors is possible as in word processing , moving with arrows . under rare circumstances , the cur@@ sor beha@@ ves as usual . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted by typing , and by means of a reset button or removed t@@ ass@@ el . &quot;
&quot; inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way via the tool@@ bars as in the source text editor . note that inser@@ ting tags previously not removed , e.g. when an anchor tag , enclosed with text , needs to be removed any other anchor tag . &quot;
some tool@@ bars like the table wizard or the lists wizard are disabled . they will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release the tables or lists need to be used tool@@ bars .
&quot; &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the examination of style sheets . unlike other style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the style of the style template can be followed . &quot;
&quot; &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully comp@@ iling , except &amp; k@@ de ; library lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and Lib@@ XML , which are already present at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de . &quot;
&quot; new to x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db @-@ compatibility mode , orph@@ aned holding points can be set in a specific file and line number and activated later . &quot;
&quot; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g determines the full path from a file name without a path . file names in the same folder as the top loaded style template file name with rel@@ ativ@@ em path to the working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g is available for example , a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ ur@@ .x@@ s@@ l , the following input is possible : &quot;
&quot; in this command , a partial or entire agreement is checked with a pre@@ age named QNA@@ P@@ or or a specified model name . &amp; eg ; template agrees with any QNA@@ P@@ ME that contains the string template . &quot;
every nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNAP &quot; will be extended by the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 is added &amp; eg ; extends to ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 19@@ 9 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a requested stop point must be resolved for the corresponding UR@@ I and line number . this will be done automatically when the first template is loaded by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g .

there are many graphical tools to compare . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ? let me explain briefly why I wrote .
the merge was complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors made a lot of changes and at the same time corrected a lot of text in many places . a further programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file .
&quot; the program I used showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines . and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . merging these changes was a small night@@ mare . &quot;
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters . later any amount of other useful functions were added .
&quot; for example , if you want to compare text quickly , simply copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and paste it in one of the comparison window . &quot;
a function that made a lot of work was the compar@@ isons and merging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
the original file ( the base ) helps &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the original file ( the base ) helps to resolve conflicts and at the same time display the expected result . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when merging them :
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you compare and merge complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , while merging the folder : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you often have to check Ko@@ de , you will like this feature . &quot;
&quot; differences in white signs and tab@@ s are displayed . if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters , you can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more trouble if someone changes the ind@@ entation . ) &quot;
&quot; if a file is equal , and the other one differs in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both distinguish files . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name but are in different folders , then you can make the typing work easier by using only the file name of the first file . for example : &quot;
folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder
&quot; opening dialog allows you to manually type file names , selecting a file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a last opened file from the drop @-@ down list . you don &apos;t need to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C blank , the analysis of differences with two files will be performed . &quot;
&quot; in the folder folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the compar@@ isons or merging of folders will be introduced . if for A a file is selected , for B and C , a folder , then used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the other two folders . &quot;
&quot; if merging is enabled , the input field is active for target and can be edited . however , it is not necessarily necessary to create an output file immediately . you can also do this step later when saving . &quot;
the setting button will open a dialog with Settings . here you can set options before you start comparing / merge .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparison window . &quot;
you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or select text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window .
&quot; what is the idea behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively big effort . you only have to create two corresponding files , load them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then you can simply copy , paste and then compare the relevant sections . &quot;
&quot; note : at the moment , you can &apos;t remove anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the drop of text into a comparison window is supported . &quot;
warning : some editors will interpret the dra@@ gging and placing text into another program than cutting and past@@ ing ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case your original data might be lost .
&quot; the info line of the source pane contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that Windows C is optional . ) Any info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , let the mouse rest for a while over the line . then a small aid window will show the full name . ) &quot;
&quot; the three source windows are the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these preferences can be changed via the Settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; when a difference is detected , you can see which file differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when comparing three files . this is good to see in the next section ( merge ) . &quot;
&quot; in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( for C / C + + , for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in a few , rare cases . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line dividing the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no rows . if the line breaks is enabled , the line is dotted along broken lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( among the comparison windows ) also has an information line with the wording output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; changes &#93; if you have edited the result . usually , it contains text , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
&quot; ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the S@@ prin@@ ge button to the next resolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . ) &quot;
&quot; if only two comparison windows are used , any difference at the same time a conflict can be solved manually . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows , the group belonging to the line will be displayed in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . it will also be highlighted with the color background color for current area and each on left appears a black bar . &quot;
&quot; sometimes through automatic merging or by manual editing there is no further line left in the group ; then it is displayed in these lines of the text &amp; lt ; no line in the source file ; this text appears neither in the final stored file , nor in a marking that you might copy and place somewhere else . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; merge conflicts ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function . &quot;
&quot; note : when selecting the sources , ignore the options or ignore Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments will also be treated like white characters . &quot;
&quot; navigate in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , page off , right , high , down , page beginning , end , end , end , end , end , end , end , end , end , end , end , end , end , end , end , end , end , end , end , end , end , end , end , end , end , end , end , end , end , end , end , end , end , end , end , end , end , end , end , end , end , end , end , end , end , end , end , end , end , end , end , end , end , end , end , end , end , end , and string end . &quot;
&quot; in the output window , you can also use the other buttons for editing . using the inser@@ tion button , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insert mode . ) &quot;
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as explained in the merge and edi@@ table output window ) .
&quot; the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons to navigate with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture upward ) or to the next / previous conflict . &quot;
&quot; to copy the marking to the cli@@ p@@ board , you need to copy the copy button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l inser@@ tion ) . there is also the option selection automatically copy . if this is enabled , you automatically copy the option selection . be careful with this option , because you might over@@ write the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
&quot; line ends are saved according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a new@@ line boost \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use cart return + new@@ line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not keep the end @-@ end of the source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also do not use binary files . &quot;
the options and the list of recently used files will be automatically saved and restored to the next start . ( menu Adju@@ st@@ ment - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set up ... )
&quot; select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also provides fon@@ ts with variable width to choose , but you should not use them . ) &quot;
&quot; if you activate this option , differences are displayed in itali@@ c font . if the chosen font does not support this display , nothing happens . &quot;
&quot; in systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be rendered rendered . &quot;
&quot; if this option is checked , the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab@@ ul@@ ator button . otherwise , a tab@@ ul@@ ator character is inserted . &quot;
&quot; if you press En@@ ter or Return , the previous line will automatically be used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; if this option is checked , any selection is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . manually copy to the cli@@ p@@ board is om@@ itted . &quot;
you can choose which line type you prefer to save . the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used .
&quot; the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step , white characters are ignored . in this step , white characters are ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) save a cart return character &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a line feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others again save a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters . &quot;
&quot; search for even smaller differences . the option is activated in default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slow in very large files . &quot;
&quot; in Automatic Fur@@ ther Mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict will continue . &quot;
&quot; auto @-@ select all conflicts in white characters using the chosen file as a source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white characters in many files are less important . if you only need this from time to time , then use the functions Select A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . note that the Automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments , if the options are ignored or ignor@@ ing C / C + + comments enabled . &quot;
these options are dealt with in the chapter to scan folders and execute a merge . see for details under documentation for directory comparison and merging .
&quot; if a file is saved and already exists an older version , then the original version will be attached to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if already such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
&quot; changing this option does not affect the current running program . you need to quit &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; quit and restart so that the change is active . ( this option is in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available , because the language is set globally through the control center . ) &quot;
&quot; the following coding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the top setting is used for all entries . &quot;
over the selection fields for encoding appears a short notice of what the local encoding is . ( this cannot be changed here and has purely informal character for you . )
&quot; modify the file code for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted . since coding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different coding can be compared and merged . &quot;
&quot; if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding is to be used for saving . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre@@ processing commands , they might not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files may be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the preview command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can define the encoding of the output of pre @-@ processing commands . &quot;
switch off this to supp@@ ress high@@ lighting changes in white characters in the text or overview columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore or ignore C / C + + comments . )
&quot; this selection is only available when you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are shown in a color coded over@@ sight column . however , sometimes you want to see only the differences between two of three files . &quot;
sometimes you would like to use the available space on the screen for long lines . just send the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
&quot; sometimes you look at the differences and then suddenly decide to merge the files together . a simple click starts merging and uses the file name of the last source file as pres@@ et name for the output file . ( if this function is used to re@@ boot the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will be passed first to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command will be visible , and not the file itself . you can use this function for example to cut bot@@ her@@ some parts or to correct the ind@@ entation . &quot;
&quot; when you read a file , it will be passed first to this external command ( see above ) , then the output of the command is the input of this command . you can write your own pre@@ processor that corresponds exactly to your requirements . each entry line must have a corresponding output line . &quot;
&quot; the idea behind this is to allow users more flexibility when setting up the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is required , and most users do not want to program that themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l is sufficient . &quot;
use this pre@@ processing command for line balancing to convert the input into capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
the \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you experiment with sed you might begin to understand it and maybe you might like these regular expressions even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for a further pre@@ processing command for line ab@@ err@@ . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Any character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit and every hit is replaced by nothing so virtually deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform several sub@@ stitu@@ tions at one time . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions from each other . for example :
&quot; instead of used , you can also use something else like per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replacement / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos;@@ aller@@ dings are different with per@@ l . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs , per@@ l only needs ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example : &quot;
&quot; after the normal pre@@ processor , the data will be retained for viewing and merging . &quot;
&quot; note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the new@@ processor will see the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hides differences , you may not accidentally notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data . &quot;
&quot; often program@@ mers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders recur@@ sively . &quot;
... makes a proposal for each object to merge ; you can adjust the proposal before the start
... can simulate the merging and display the simulated changes without actually carrying out
... &quot; performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) , &quot;
this is very similar to comparing and merging individual files . you only need to open folders on the command line or in the dialog file .
&quot; if three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as a base . if no destination folder is specified , folder 3 is used as a destination folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders starts automatically , do not merge . to start merging , you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( see more details . ) &quot;
&quot; while reading the folder , you will be informed of a small message window about the current progress . if you cancel the scanning of the folders , only the files that have been compared to that point are listed . &quot;
&quot; when scanning the folder is complete , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 shows ; a list window with the results on the left ... &quot;
every file and folder found during the scan is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
&quot; the folder structure is usually folded together . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - , or double @-@ clicking on the object or by clicking on the arrow keys for left / right . &quot;
&quot; if you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears . &quot;
the icon in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folders , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . &quot;
&quot; as shown in the picture above , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in columns A / B / C . &quot;
&quot; with identical entries , however , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different . &quot;
&quot; folders are considered to be identical if their entire content is identical . then , even folders have the same color . at folders , age is irrelevant for its color . &quot;
&quot; the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow and later , when it is old , is red . &quot;
... &quot; A and C are identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , the merge cannot be started . &quot;
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist the merge cannot be started .
&quot; the synchron@@ ization mode is active , if only two folders and no explicit target folder are specified and if the option directories are synchron@@ ized . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical . if for one entry ... &quot;
... A and B exist but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible file names for the output file only B ; directly after merge &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B after A. )
&quot; if two folders are merged and select the new file instead of merge ( uns@@ af@@ e ) , then examine &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy . if the files are different , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange such errors are not fixed , the merging of the files cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; when merging , one file will be processed after the other . it displays status column when the merging has been successful , and accordingly other messages when something unexpected occurred . when merging is completed , you should make a final check and see if the status is OK . &quot;
&quot; if the file comparison method is selected in the setup dialog , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display additional columns . these contain the number of un@@ solved , sol@@ dered , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the merge actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start merging . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you have no destination folder , then C will be used as the target in the Three @-@ Fol@@ der merge mode , and B is used as the target and when synchron@@ izing A and / or B is used as the target . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a destination folder , please check that all entries should be in the destination folder , also in the folder structure . there are some options that might be ski@@ pped by certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises : &quot;
to merge all entries : select directory entry / continue in the list menu or press F@@ 7 ( the key abbrevi@@ ation ) . to select only the current entry : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
&quot; if conflic@@ ting file types still exist invalid merge actions , a message appears that indicates the faulty elements . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; when you merge all entries , a dialog window with the options will appear , Sim@@ ulate and Canc@@ el . &quot;
select Sim@@ ulate if you only want to see what would happen without the real changes made . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window opens ( note the screen@@ shot ) . &quot;
&quot; when you are finished with a file , select again start directory merge / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , a corresponding dialog appears . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; your work continues with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you to check the cause of the problem . if you continue merging ( F@@ 7 key ) , you can try to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in other ways before you continue merging . &quot;
&quot; if some entries have been merged individually , these entries ( in the current session ) will not work together again . even if the merging has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be considered complete . only if you change the merging action , these entries will be merged again . &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set up ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . separate patterns can be entered with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not match this pattern .
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS . many aut@@ mati@@ cally generated files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this can be set with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
&quot; in some file systems , files have a hidden attribute . in other file systems , a prec@@ ursor point marks a file as hidden . this option lets you decide if these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in default . &quot;
&quot; links to files : when the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; if the option is turned off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is turned on , the links like normal folders will be treated and recur@@ sively searched . &quot;
&quot; full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files containing no text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot;
&quot; if you compare large folders through a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the change date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain degree of security . &quot;
similar to the date of change . no real comparison takes place . the files are considered identical if they are equal . this can be useful when copying the date of change . please use caution . this option is switched off in default .
&quot; synchron@@ ize mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified . in this mode , the suggestions for merging are selected so that both folders are identical . also , the results from merging files are stored in both folders . this option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , instead of merging the newer file as action is suggested . ( this is considered uns@@ af@@ e because it assumes the knowledge that the other file has not been modified too . you should check this in any case . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another file , then the original version will be renamed and gets the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file with the .@@ ori@@ g extension already exists , it will be deleted without further backup . this also affects the merging of individual files , not only the merging of entire folders . this option is enabled in default . &quot;
&quot; normally , the folder merge view is visible while merging individual files ; you can shift the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want this , you can switch the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want this , you can switch the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views by switching between the directory and the text window . &quot;
&quot; you probably prefer to compare a file simply by double @-@ clicking . however , there is also a menu entry in the list menu . you can also merge a single file directly without having to run the folder together . &quot;
&quot; however , this status will be lost if you re @-@ read the directory : &quot;
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO @-@ Sla@@ ves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . this allows you to specify files and folders that are located on local or remote machines .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has another syntax as local files and folders . you should note a few things :
&quot; a path may be relative and@@ . or .. contain . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute . &quot;
&quot; special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , spaces &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file with the name / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes by the protocol used . a short list of limitations follows : &quot;
&quot; or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or a folder shows . then , a file is always assumed as a link destination . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no way to edit per@@ missions or change of change . therefore , the per@@ missions or the date of change devi@@ ate from the original . ( note the option Trust of Size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . ) &quot;
&quot; the main purpose is currently as a difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P . K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P always starts the built @-@ in differences viewer . to start K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P , press the right mouse button above the difference viewer and then select In K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if it is used as a part , it takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch program will start to recover the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in Con@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select Pre@@ view into - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu . note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file is created . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 is executed as part , it only supports comparing two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . merging or comparing folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode . &quot;
&quot; tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now he@@ els are compact ) already exist . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already shows that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff tool collection . &quot;
I have been using GP@@ L programs for a long time and learned a lot by checking in the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all program@@ mers who have gone this way or have to go that way .
&quot; you have compiled the program from the sources and probably don &apos;t have the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in default configure is installed in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can not find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is treated as not identical . &quot;
this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create a separate file format that could store this information .
&quot; you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text , another editor should be used . &quot;
&quot; after removing text is suddenly lt ; No sr@@ c is swept , and the text can &apos;t be deleted . what does that mean and how can that be removed ? &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; already uses a lot of colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild web . thank you !
&quot; to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or newer . &quot;
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of the last changes can be found under ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the source package .
&quot; to compile and install , use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution : &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE @-@ dir speci@@ fies the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file . &quot;
&quot; since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake use , you should not have problems comp@@ iling . however , if difficulties pers@@ ist , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists . &quot;
cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Shift ) copies to the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Shift ) paste the text from the cli@@ p@@ board to the current cur@@ sor position and replaces the current marker .
&quot; show only differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the destination folder . &quot;
&quot; ( in the current program version , you will need to re @-@ read the folder with the Update function after changes to these options . ) &quot;
&quot; only entries are displayed that show differences . this also means that identical files are not copied to the destination folder when merging . if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after merging . ( the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already available ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed when clicking the button . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a miniature preview of all virtual work surfaces . it is quite practical to see the running programs on the working surfaces , change their size , to stop them or move them . this works both inside a desktop and at several . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work surfaces , as well as the applications running in it . the applications can be selected and even moved to the desktop and to others . &quot;
&quot; with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; motion is possible both inside a desktop and on other working surfaces . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu has only the two entries p@@ ager . &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
&quot; if this check box is selected , windows within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other work@@ tops . &quot;
&quot; if this field is checked , in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the names of the virtual work@@ space are displayed . &quot;
&quot; tick this field lets the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; show the numbers of virtual work@@ space . if it is shown together with name , the names are marked with ord@@ inal numbers , &amp; eg ; 1 . desktop . &quot;
&quot; if this field is checked , the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; &quot;
&quot; if this field is checked , the running programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only empty working spaces are displayed to enable their selection . &quot;
&quot; here , the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the windows with its default symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems . &quot;
&quot; here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classic leaves &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ N grid , as from p@@ ager applications appears in a vertical row , which is very good for displaying later@@ ally on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the p@@ ager mini @-@ program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , which can display and move windows as symbols or with their contents . furthermore , it runs out of the control bar . &quot;
&quot; right @-@ click within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then select switch settings , and dialog settings will appear . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , this cannot be changed in the dialog settings . however , you can do this manually : &quot;
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor , such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vice versa . if you do not have a write permission for the file , you must login as user root or contact your system administrator . &quot;
&quot; since &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package is k@@ de@@ base , you will need a working installation of the K@@ DE basic packages . &quot;

&quot; &amp; K@@ mag ; is a screen lu@@ pe . you can use &amp; K@@ mag ; you can view a part of the screen , as if you were reading a magni@@ fying glass for the small print or the exact viewing of a photo . this application is intended to be a complete manual for use of &amp; K@@ mag ; &quot;
&amp; K@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly enhanced with new functions . it is optimized for use on low @-@ performance computers .
&quot; if you &amp; K@@ mag ; start , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; K@@ mag ; displays the enlarged area of the screen . the image shown in the magni@@ fying window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as the selection window . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , &amp; K@@ mag ; the area around the mouse po@@ inter like a mo@@ ve@@ able lou@@ pe . alternatively , you can use a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( select window mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse @-@ po@@ inter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left edge of the screen ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to avoid that the mouse po@@ inter is shown in the enlarged window , select the Edit mouse cur@@ sor . please note that &amp; K@@ mag ; currently not able to recognize the shape of the mouse @-@ po@@ inter . this is always the standard node ; / Q@@ t ; mouse cur@@ sor . &quot;
&quot; in the selection window mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way : &quot;
&quot; move the mouse po@@ inter in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button pressed , so you can capture and move the content of the magni@@ fying window . this also goes with the arrow keys . &quot;
&quot; if you additionally press the &amp; Shift key , press the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the selection window . &quot;
&quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the selection window remains firm and only the lower right corner is moved . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer , save into a file , paste it into the cli@@ p@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , turn the image and more . &quot;
start or stop the display . stopping the update causes the needed CPU time to go to 0 .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mou@@ sec@@ lick as soon as the mouse po@@ inter stays on the same spot for a while . it is meant to help people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome ( Re@@ peti@@ tive @-@ Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury Syndrome ) and which every mouse click causes pain .
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulate a mou@@ sec@@ lick as soon as the mouse po@@ inter stays on the same spot for a while . it is meant to help people who are suffering at the Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome , and it can em@@ ulate the dra@@ gging with the mouse . however , this requires a little practice . &quot;
&quot; and k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain associated with mouse clicks and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . if you suffer from pain associated with your computer &apos;s use , you should consult a doctor if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; to clarify it again : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic relief products , the result can be different for everyone . &quot;
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and leads a mouse click as soon as you stop the movement .
&quot; the smart move activ@@ ates , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after it emul@@ ates the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the release of the mouse button is executed . &quot;
this residence time must be stored at the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click performs .
&quot; if Intel@@ ligent Shift is enabled , the shooting time is activated ( 1 / 10 s ) . here , the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is waiting before it left the mouse button again , if there is no moving of the mouse in the meantime . &quot;
&quot; this function is activated in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ est@@ kes@@ .@@ txt , when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time is started , but they can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; when the sound is delayed , you can shor@@ ten the response time . go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System and click on the tab General . there is a slide control sound buffer that lets you adjust to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times . &quot;
&quot; this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at each start of &amp; k@@ de ; start . this function is currently only available under &amp; k@@ de ; please consult the respective documentation for G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments to find out how to start a program there . &quot;
&quot; reset all settings to the values set when open the dialog . once you have pressed the Apply button , the settings will be reset to the state after the final push of the user . &quot;
&quot; it is best to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , first with the Pre@@ ferences . in particular , the smart move should be switched off first . if you have used to the automatic mouse click , you can later accept the smart move . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it might be necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; in case of sounds . &quot;
&quot; first , you should be aware of which places a mou@@ sec@@ lick remains without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in places in the browser window that does not link leads to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park your mouse in such places until you want to use it again . &quot;
&quot; if your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . that &apos;s usually pretty simple . the trick is that you don &apos;t just clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball . &quot;
&quot; first , you have to take the mouse ball out . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be clear when you look at the bottom of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you use the smart move in this case , that means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer end by releasing the mouse button . &quot;
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use a different window manager and move a window .
&quot; the solution for this problem is that you can run a mouse click yourself . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and you can continue working as usual . &quot;
&quot; problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and put the cur@@ sor to another place . &quot;
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor over where you want it . but park your mouse on a neutral area of the desktop if you want to use a keyboard input . secure zones for the mouse po@@ inter are &amp; eg ; the grey areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the front lines of windows .
&quot; I try to work with the intelligent move , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text . &quot;
&quot; the smart move is an advanced feature of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very likely to copy text , copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board , or execute any other action where you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . here are some advice : &quot;
&quot; do not use the smart move if you just start using it &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; instead , select a mouse click at an end of the text area and press the Shift key while moving the mouse po@@ inter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again . &quot;
&quot; use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this will pop up everytime , when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse click . &quot;
&quot; to be able to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window needs to be installed . that should be the case on most systems . &quot;
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound@@ card and speaker and it is correctly set up .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; push the mouse button as soon as the mouse po@@ inter freezes . this program has been developed for people who suffer from R@@ SI &apos;s syndrome and which causes the an@@ tigen of the bri@@ st@@ ear@@ est pain .
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to allow a pulling process to start before the mouse button is released . in this way , the dra@@ gging and dra@@ gging can be done with the mouse . &quot;

&amp; mouth ; is a program that dum@@ b users can talk to their computer for themselves .
&quot; with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , dum@@ b users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the course of the conversation that should be discussed again . &quot;
&quot; on the first page of the wizard ( left screen shot ) , enter the command that will later be used for the voice output of text . further details can be found in the description of the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; on the second page , select the default text pas@@ sage@@ book . from the text passages , you can often select used text passages without having to type them . text passages can of course be edited . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; read the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of each word . in addition , you can balance the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only properly sp@@ elled words can be added to the vocabulary . &quot;
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and essentially contains a input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and a ver@@ min memory of the already spoken phrases ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
&quot; if you have correctly set up , you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field . each spoken sentence is attached to the flow memory . you can select sets that are to be discussed again . &quot;
&quot; with the menu entry settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the Settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two map cards , voice output and settings , the page word completion as well as the side of the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . &quot;
&quot; in the box of the voice output box , enter the command to call the language generator . in the drop @-@ down box under the input field , specify the character encoding , with which text is passed on to the voice generator . &quot;
&quot; &amp; mouth ; knows two ways to pass on the text . select the check box , if the text is to be passed on to the language generator unchanged as standard input . &quot;
&quot; if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed on as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command to voice output depends on your language generator . you will find this command in the documentation to your language generator . examples for this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; T@@ ts@@ d @-@ Sprach@@ dienste is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ dem@@ on , the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications provide a standardized interface for voice output and which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first drop @-@ down sel@@ ector action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the Text@@ pass@@ book menu or in the bar for text passages . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of immediate words , the selected text passage is directly spoken and added in addition to the query memory . when selecting from In the input field , the selected text passage is first entered only in the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second drop @-@ down box of the editing window for text pass@@ book , you can determine if the text pas@@ sage@@ book should be saved automatically when closing the editing window . &quot;
&quot; save the book . if you choose to reject changes , the text pas@@ sage@@ book will not be saved . select Before saving , will &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if you want to save the text pas@@ sage@@ book . &quot;
&quot; the word supplement page contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the word completion . in the main window next to the input field , you can select a selection field if this list contains more than one dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons on the right side of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . &quot;
&quot; for this source , select the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then read the list of words . the frequency of the individual words is easily measured by counting the occurrence . in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , in order to add just written words into the new dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then ask what dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they should be wei@@ ghted . &quot;
&quot; with this option you create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically add to the dictionary , you can create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time . &quot;
the main window of the window for editing text passages is divided into two . in the upper part the text passages are displayed as tree structure .
&quot; in the lower part , you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated keyboard short@@ cut . if you have selected a text pas@@ time book , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; add actions like new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books , either by selecting the menu bar , the tool@@ bar or a drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
the order of text passages or text passages can be changed by dra@@ gging with the mouse to the new position or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; key .
&quot; the selected text is cut out and copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the storage memory . &quot;
&quot; the selected text is copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the storage memory . &quot;
&quot; the currently active sentence is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected sentences of the course memory . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is checked , a sliding tool bar is displayed using buttons for frequently used commands . by default , the tool@@ bar is placed directly under the menu bar by clicking on the sh@@ aded left side and pulling the tool@@ bar to another place . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is checked , a narrow bar is displayed in the lower part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if not checked , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is checked , a sli@@ dable bar is displayed for text passages with entries . by default , the bar is placed directly under the tool@@ bar by clicking on the sh@@ aded left side and pulling the tool@@ bar to another place . &quot;
&quot; you probably have the command for the voice output not correct or not fully entered . open settings k@@ mouth ; set up Settings ... , open the page General Settings and enter the command for voice output on the voice output speech synthes@@ izer . ( see Settings dialog for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers for more details . ) &quot;
&quot; festival is a language edition system from the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wal@@ is@@ isch are supported . the license allows to use the festival free of charge and without restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival directory . the command to voice output is then : &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a written language generator , written in &amp; Java . currently , it only supports English pron@@ unciation . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS free of charge and without further restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line to set up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ ett folder . the voice output is then possible with one of the three following commands : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option must be turned on as standard input . ( this is the recommended example for the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
&quot; MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to rip the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications . &quot;
&quot; in our example , Ha@@ di@@ fax is used to convert German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that Ha@@ di@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately Ha@@ di@@ fax is happy to send the last sign of the text , so that an additional character has to be added . therefore , the full command is more complex than in the other examples : &quot;
( cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; art@@ sp@@ lay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option to send data as standard input must be enabled .
the voice output da@@ emon from &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a language service that provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice output systems .
&quot; since the setting of the language generator is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only have to use it as a voice service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set . &quot;
&quot; to setup , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page that appears in the &amp; k@@ mouth adjustment dialog ; if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; &amp; mouth ; you need a language generator ( and natural &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; needs about 15 MB of memory ( and additional memory for the voice generator ) , but it depends on your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people who cannot speak , can output text by the computer . a list of previously mentioned sentences is stored , which the user can always re@@ write . &quot;
note that &amp; mouth ; no speech synthes@@ izer contains . a speech synthes@@ izer must be installed on the computer .

&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; - the voice output system from &amp; k@@ de ; - is a module of existing service , which allows any application to read text about the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface . &quot;
&quot; &amp; T@@ ts ; is a sub @-@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; programmer ready , with which their applications can be equipped with T@@ TS capabilities . &quot;
&quot; read texts ( or parts thereof ) in the text editor &amp; Po@@ sters ; , even if &amp; Po@@ sters ; embedded in other &amp; node ; applications . &quot;
&quot; the speech output takes place via the speech speech @-@ schedul@@ er , which uses various background programs such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc . &quot;
enables the generation of voice output on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; -@@ help program .

&quot; before you can use it , you need to install program speech @-@ schedul@@ er and set correctly . see also &quot;
&quot; at the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the tab card will be displayed . see also . if you have set up at least one speaker , the card card is displayed in general . see . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female ones , or those that differ in volume or speed . they can also set up several variants for a synthes@@ izer . &quot;
different speakers for the same synthes@@ izer are comparable to several printers for the same printer .
&quot; if you click on the Spe@@ akers &apos; tab in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the tab card will appear . this will also appear automatically if you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up . &quot;
all already furnished speakers appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear in the list above . the top speaker is used for voice output if an application does not pre@@ tend to be a speaker .
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to push the speaker in the list one line further down . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority . &quot;
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the running &amp; running system .
&quot; choose a type of mood here , three male and three female voices as well as a boys and girls voice are available . &quot;
&quot; if you click here , the new speaker will appear on the tab card or@@ ator . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit . &quot;
now you can almost use it . go back to the card General and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) so that the T@@ TS service is enabled by &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can use it to create and manage text orders . see .
&quot; if you have at least one speaker , you can start the &amp; k@@ de voice output system ; click General to open this map tab . here you can set some general options . &quot;
&quot; check this check box to enable the &amp; t@@ ts ; this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the tab card will be displayed and you can create text orders and read pre @-@ read . see . remove the marking , K@@ TT@@ SD will be stopped and the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; disabled . &quot;
&quot; when kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is terminated , it works &amp; ts ; further , if the field of voice output is activated ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is marked and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will appear automatically in the control bar when reading , it disappears once the reading is completed . &quot;
&quot; with buttons in this row you can start , cancel , pause and resume text orders . &quot;
&quot; with buttons in this row , you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; read cli@@ p@@ board or open a text file to read . you can also change the speaker for a job . &quot;
&quot; click Apply or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all pages . &quot;
&quot; the card orders will only be displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD has been started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click the General tab and tick the Voice Output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de , you can read the text of the displayed website . then check the text that should be read before , and select the text in the main menu . after a short time , the speech output should start . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a website . you can also skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; -@@ pre @-@ tension@@ ers and other invisible brands are also read out . &quot;
&quot; then check the text that should be read before , and select the text to read in the main menu . then the speech output should start . &quot;
&quot; this also works when &amp; Po@@ sters ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; . &quot;
&quot; K@@ not@@ fy is the &amp; k@@ de news system , which noti@@ fies you about events you set out . you can read the text of these messages from &amp; on . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program from &amp; k@@ de , you can set up various types of messages . you can set up &amp; conversation ; for example , set up that you are notified when your nick@@ name occurs . with &amp; t@@ ts ; you can then read the IR@@ C message text . &quot;
&quot; supports a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program K@@ not@@ fy , a menu entry will appear in the Settings menu of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ depending on the application . &quot;
&quot; the k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml file , which is included in the delivery of &amp; t@@ ts , is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as it can be assumed in most cases as pres@@ upp@@ osed . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; t@@ ts ; . for normal work with &amp; t@@ ts ; filters are not required .
&quot; in filters , text is processed before it is sent to the speech speech dispens@@ er . they are useful for improving pron@@ unciation , to select false spoken words or short@@ cuts , to select a suitable language and speaker , or to avoid certain defici@@ encies of speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the working method of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &quot;
&quot; the issue of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and keeps these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the reserved orders will be resum@@ ed . &quot;
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news like &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will be resum@@ ed after issuing the warning .
&quot; a message canc@@ els normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you &amp; eg ; read a long text on a website , you can with &amp; k@@ mouth ; see someone who just steps into the room . &amp; k ; noti@@ fications are also news . read more . &quot;
&quot; the rest are simple text orders . each order that you initiate orders from the card adapter is a text order . K@@ Sa@@ y@@ it is an example of an application that uses text orders . text orders are meant for the output of longer texts , which do not possess any particular ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; all four order types are processed in queue , except the issue of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a Screen Re@@ aders while &amp; ts ; just one such reads , this issue is stopped and terminated . &quot;
&quot; first you need to know that filters will never be applied to Screen Re@@ aders . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages . &quot;
filters process the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there can still be further types of filters .
replace parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; is provided with pre@@ defined string inser@@ tion filters that allow the replacing of chat emoti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or text format@@ ting ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better intel@@ li@@ gible form .
&quot; &amp; XML ; Tran@@ sm@@ itter use an X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert from one format to another format . in the scope of delivery , some X@@ SL@@ T files are included in the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; with speaker selection filters you can send orders depending on the content of the text , or depending on the program that has sent the text to &amp; ts . if you have hired a female voice for example on the card card or@@ ator , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it . read about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these filters has adjustable rules , after which it is used for voice output . if the filter determines that its rules are not applicable , the filter will continue to pass the text unchanged to the next filter . &quot;
&quot; if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification is sent to &amp; t@@ ts ; it is processed by all activated filters that were installed on the bottom of the page . editing by the filter takes place in the list from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and the next entries will be shown below . &quot;
&quot; for setting drawing filters , you have to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern . if these patterns are found in the text , the text will be replaced with the corresponding replacement text . &quot;
&quot; enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name as you like , it just needs to differ from the names of the other filters . &quot;
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with strings in the column agreement and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Re@@ place . the list is processed in the displayed order from top to bottom .
click here to post@@ p@@ one the selected word or regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . download a list from a file , the entries from the file are attached to the existing list . &quot;
&quot; if a language is entered here , the filter will only be applied if the speaker speaks for one of the languages registered here . click the button to display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you hold the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; key pressed at the mouse @-@ click . &quot;
&quot; if a value is entered here , the filter will only be applied if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separately by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
&quot; the application ID of running programs is available with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; d@@ bus ; numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 , you may only enter copies . &quot;
&quot; if all the input fields are empty , the filter will be applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; when comparing words , the string substitute filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s . thus , the words must be limited on both sides by separ@@ ators ( spaces ) . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will not find instructions to write regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the box . &quot;
&quot; XML ; Trans@@ former translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from a format in another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W3@@ C standard for such conver@@ sions . however , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility program needs to be installed on your system . &quot;
&quot; enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the environment variable PAT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is enough . &quot;
&quot; with the Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection filter , you can send texts to a specific speaker set up on the tab card or to a speaker with specific features . for example , you can specify that texts from k@@ mail should be read by a female voice . see . &quot;
&quot; the speaker is selected based on the speaker characteristics that the program proposes , which indicates the text , and the features of the speakers created on the card card . with the Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection Fil@@ ters , you can over@@ write the chosen speaker . &quot;
&quot; here is a value registered , the filter is applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular expressions are installed , you can click the button to get help when entering . &quot;
&quot; to get a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; here , place the characteristics of the speaker you want . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker is selected which meets the desired requirements . click the button on the right to show the dialog box selection . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to save , load , or delete all settings . &quot;
the Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection Filter is applied only to the text if all conditions are applied with an entry in the box Di@@ ese Filter if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .

&quot; I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; re@@ forming filter , but when using the module for festival websites , websites are not read . &quot;
&quot; due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you need to install the ( male British ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone , so that S@@ able does not work at all . &quot;
&quot; certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation characters appear to cause errors in the synthes@@ izer , so that whole sets are ski@@ pped or only gi@@ b@@ ber@@ ish is spent . what can I do about it ? &quot;
&quot; first , make sure the character encoding option is set to the correct value for the appropriate language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , these may be remedi@@ ed by a string replace filter . see . &quot;

K@@ T@@ TS works with any speech synthes@@ izer which can be started on the command line in a console .
&quot; the list of languages mentioned above may be incomplete or outdated . therefore , refer to the description of the synthes@@ izer to the supported languages . &quot;
&quot; the speech speech synthes@@ izer program uses an adap@@ table module architecture for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to extend the use of another synthes@@ izer , please contact the developer team . &quot;
&quot; the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ml and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter , but is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command . &quot;
&quot; to compile , compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) including packages of k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the speech &quot; speech dispens@@ er . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you have downloaded the source texts from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source archive for k@@ de@@ dness , or downloaded the tar@@ ball currently created each night , compile and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you use it , first check if speech synthes@@ izer works properly with your speech synthes@@ izer . you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf . &quot;
&quot; &amp; T@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; t@@ ts , which uses the speech speech dispens@@ er . the kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr program should be developed in such a way that the setup of speech dispens@@ ers is possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer required . &quot;
&quot; a long text is broken down into individual sentences , allowing the user to go back pun@@ ctu@@ ation or paragraph , pause , pause , or cancel the output . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and its gender female , it is used , otherwise the best matching speaker will be selected . if you want to learn more about how &amp; t@@ ts ; a speaker sel@@ ects , you will see in . &quot;
&quot; if you click Add Ac@@ tu@@ ator on the tab , and to add a speaker to the list or click Edit , the card reader device will be displayed . for example , the module will be displayed for Festival Inter@@ active . details on the modules can be found below . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to festival is included in PAT@@ H , you just have to enter the festival . &quot;
&quot; choose the character encoding for text that will be passed to festival . in voices , the &amp; t@@ ts , this setting is automatically done . generally , Western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these slider controls you can adjust the volume , speaking speed , and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select a few controls and display this grey , the voice you choose does not allow these settings to be displayed . &quot;
&quot; some voices such as multi @-@ sy@@ n voices require several seconds to be loaded due to their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded when you start K@@ TT@@ SD , so ( for larger memory consumption ) the first set will be synthes@@ ized faster . &quot;
&quot; if this check box cannot be selected , you have not set up a speaker or click Apply . see . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected , the kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr program window is displayed at the start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , after the start only the kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr icon is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is marked and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not run yet , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD is reading a text . this allows you to pause or otherwise control the reading . &quot;
&quot; here , all orders in the queue are listed , along with the application , which has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the precisely processed proposition . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the tab card or@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; using the buttons in this row , you can set or go back in the order that is selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) . &quot;
&quot; with a click on OK , all changes in the settings ( also on the other card cards ) are taken over and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window again . &quot;
&quot; if the sound system &amp; arts is not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the audio card audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; only text orders are listed and managed here . screen Re@@ aders , warnings and messages are not displayed . &quot;
&quot; select the type of audio output . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; t@@ ts ; either compiled or deleted without any support for the respective audio module , you cannot load the required libraries . &quot;
&quot; if G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for audio output , select the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here . see also &quot;
&quot; adjust the speaking speed here . 50@@ ,00 ; % corresponds to about half and 200@@ 000 ; % for example the double normal speaking speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program needs to be installed so@@ x . &quot;
click Apply to take over the new settings for the running &amp; frac@@ tal system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules installed in your system . most of them will not work . you will need to find out what device works with you . in case of doubt choose Standard .
&quot; on this card card you can set up special promotions , which are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &quot;
&quot; the issue of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and keeps these orders . after the output of the screen reader is read , the reserved orders are resum@@ ed . &quot;
warnings have the next highest priority . this level is important news like &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning holds the output of messages and normal text . these orders will resume after reading the warning .
&quot; news has the next priority . a message canc@@ els normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks out messages . if you &amp; eg ; just read a long text on a website , you can with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone who just steps into the room . &quot;
&quot; a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a Screen Re@@ aders , adds &amp; t@@ ts ; the audio output into the queue . &quot;
&quot; this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both sound and introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this card card are only valid for normal text orders . for messages , warnings and the expendi@@ tures of screen readers there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority . &quot;
&quot; to start reading K@@ not@@ ing messages , start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click Noti@@ fications . the card message will appear . &quot;
&quot; check this check box to turn on &amp; k@@ de ; if this setting is un@@ checked , the other settings are disabled and &amp; t@@ ts ; do not read al@@ erts . &quot;
&quot; this setting is selected , noti@@ fications where a sound is played from &amp; t@@ ts ; not read . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . when you click the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list . &quot;
&quot; this event reads the message , the &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; sends out if someone is mentioned in an IR@@ C message to your nick@@ name . &quot;
&quot; all events , for which nothing else is specified in the list , are ignored . &quot;
use this sel@@ ector to specify what &amp; t@@ ts ; to do when an event arrives . you have the following choices :
&quot; if you have selected user defined text , enter the text you want . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; you can enter the properties of the speaker you want here . default chooses the speaker , which is displayed as top entry in the list on the tab card . see also . &quot;
&quot; note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a certain event of a particular application , it is executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application . &quot;
the event All Noti@@ fications for the Application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . you can set the default noti@@ fications as follows :
&quot; use the Save button to save the settings for the Noti@@ fications to a file . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except All Noti@@ fications will be deleted . &quot;
&quot; Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ml ) is a W3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard includes trademarks for controlling voices , speaking speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch . &quot;
currently supported &amp; pun@@ ts ; SS@@ ml only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
&quot; you need to install the R@@ ab _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) , since this is the default voice , the festival is used in the edition of SS@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; if the settings for speed or pitch in the Festival configuration dialog are not set to 100@@ 000 ; % , the text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ously . &quot;

&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . this allows you to start or stop orders from the first set , since only the first set does not need to be synthes@@ ized , even if the speech synthes@@ izer does not support it directly . &quot;
&quot; here you see the pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters . at the first start of &amp; t@@ ts , a set limit recognition filter is automatically set up . you can modify its settings or add other set limits filters , but beginners will get away from it . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to learn the device selection by trying out . switch on the box selection and select text to read . if you select the speaker &apos;s selection , change some features and check the selection of the speaker . of course you have to set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ops ; then faster to start reading , since only the first set needs to be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long , &quot;
&quot; if the speech synthes@@ izer does not support this function , you can then pause or cancel orders on the map . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the normal set of pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters is automatically set up when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it can not be switched off , only removed . do not change anything to this filter unless you know what you are doing . &quot;
pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters compare text with a regular expression for pun@@ ctu@@ ation and add a tab ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to the set limits ( tab marks are automatically removed from the text in front of the filter ) . note that the standard pun@@ ctu@@ ation filter retains the character set .
&quot; S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ bps ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen re@@ a@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the normal set of pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters , you can insert it again by loading the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file contained in &amp; ts . &quot;
&quot; on the card box of Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection , you can over@@ write the Spe@@ aker Settings for the application . &quot;
use of the standard speaker ( the top of the card holder ) . in other words : no speaker characteristics are specified .
&quot; using the most appropriate speaker , which has all the characteristics of a subscri@@ ber . if you do not delete or edit the settings of the subscri@@ ber , select &amp; hold this speaker . otherwise , you choose the speaker that most likely corresponds to the originally set properties . &quot;
&quot; select the method to enter the desired speaker properties , by clicking on one of the selection buttons . &quot;
&quot; select the properties of the speaker you want . if this feature does not matter , enter nothing . &quot;
mark this check box if the property should have preced@@ ence over other properties . you can also set several markers here .
&quot; as the language is a critical factor in understanding the issue , it is always treated as priority property . you will rarely use this feature . &quot;
&quot; to use all the features in the speaker , which is most likely to delete the following , click on the default speaker and then use the speaker that is closest to the following . &quot;
&quot; in this case , 0 is for the last text order in the queue . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number the input 0 is required ) . &quot;
&quot; kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr crashes immediately when it is started . I have compiled de@@ bug support , but I don &apos;t get any re@@ trac@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is down and &amp; t@@ ts ; it has ended . probably you need to register G@@ Stre@@ amer yet . if the problem is not solved , you might need to install a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; the audio output via AL@@ SA does not work if I play music simultaneously with another application . if I hold a text order , freeze &amp; t@@ ts ; one . on the console ; a message that states : Un@@ able to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; on your system , there is a problem that conflicts with AL@@ SA can occur which prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . please refer to the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) on www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org . &quot;
I uploaded an additional voice for festival from the Internet . I installed it and can use it in festival but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr shows this voice not .
&quot; in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / ct@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tiv@@ al@@ int / voices the new voice can be added . if that is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice , to the developers . &quot;
&quot; in order for this to work , the program needs to be installed so@@ x and can be found above the environment variable PAT@@ H . some syn@@ th@@ esi@@ zer@@ modules such as Festival Inter@@ active offer a setting for speed . depending on the chosen voice , it is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; de@@ activate either the filter for the conversion from &amp; HTML ; to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ to @-@ SS@@ ml re@@ forming filter , and set up the speaking speed . &quot;
&quot; I do not manage to read web pages with a female voice . I have set up a female festival speaker , but respect@@ fully ; reads the websites with a male voice . &quot;
&quot; with Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the Tag S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . so that the festival does not produce any errors , the x@@ s@@ l file will reject the GEN@@ DER @-@ tags for converting SS@@ ml to S@@ aber . the same goes for the VO@@ ICE tags . &quot;
&quot; I have added my own string attachment filter and now I can go back or go back in &amp; ts . orders will be displayed , the order only consists of one set . what am I doing wrong ? &quot;
&quot; you may not filter inter@@ pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks ( dot , question mark , ex@@ clamation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) . instead , use a filter for pun@@ ctu@@ ation detection instead . &quot;
Al@@ sa ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . Al@@ sa is installed on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org )
G@@ Stre@@ amer in version 0.@@ 8.@@ 7 or later . note : make sure that the G@@ Stre@@ amer modules are registered by using G@@ Stre@@ amer in &amp; kt@@ ts . ( HTTP : / / g@@ stre@@ amer@@ .@@ fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org )
&quot; some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts in audio output . if your system is also included , you can not simultaneously play music and read a text . &quot;
&quot; as of July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de still does not support real breaks . if you hold a text order in &amp; int , the current set will be read yet . &quot;
&quot; the audio program so@@ x is used for general setting of speaking speed , but is not necessarily necessary . Deb@@ ian users can install apt @-@ get install so@@ x using the command apt @-@ get install so@@ x . the program is already included on most &amp; Linux ; -@@ CDs . &quot;
&quot; if you have downloaded a tar@@ ball ( tar @-@ packed archive ) , register as a normal user and un@@ zip the tar@@ ball into a matching folder . change to this folder and enter the following commands : &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 , the module &amp; arts is probably removed or at least only created on request . &quot;
the following modules for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers are created by default . some of them have a running time depen@@ dency of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the guidelines of the Deb@@ ian distribution ) .
&quot; as default , &amp; t@@ ts ; in / opt / k@@ de@@ 3 is installed . if this folder is not listed in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you must specify the --@@ pre@@ fix = destination option . for example &quot;
&quot; on Deb@@ ian systems , / usr / local is the right folder for programs translated from sources . &quot;
CD c@@ app@@ alling echo kt@@ ts@@ d &gt; inst program make -@@ f Mak@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ c@@ vs . / configure cd kt@@ ts@@ d make su make install
&quot; before you use it , check first whether your speech synthes@@ izer works correctly . follow the instructions that you have received with the synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and multiple voices and languages are supported . &quot;
&quot; you need to install at least one language . you will find help in the instructions provided with festival . if you want to read web pages , you need to install the ( male British ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of festival . German voices are subject to restrictions on sharing . &quot;
&quot; the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ pack the software in festival / li@@ b / voices / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian votes , you need to enter the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . select a Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 bit ) coding as for example ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . look for the festival first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the code must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the option code must be set to an 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic like ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then Festival takes over the le@@ x@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; it generates the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no complete voice output system . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from Di@@ phon files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone . festival produces these from &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; needed di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also be generated from German text di@@ phone . more information can be found here .
&quot; in this procedure , additional wra@@ pper code is added to festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice synthesis voices . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice files won &apos;t be installed in the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folder , but in the Fol@@ der festival / li@@ b / . instructions can be found under &quot;
I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of Festival for German &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; - Vo@@ ices . required is either Festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install Festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then download MS German Festival from
&quot; instructions can be found in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file in the package you have downloaded .

&quot; on some systems , you need to edit the / etc / fes@@ tiv@@ al@@ .@@ sc@@ m file . just insert the lines for your installed German voices . replace the right path in / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / . at the time of creating this manual , the German de@@ 4 , de@@ 5 , or de@@ 6 voices do not work with I@@ MS German Festival . &quot;
this procedure uses special code to issue the language through festival with a Czech &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; get and install at first Festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and make sure that both work . then download Festival @-@ Czech from
un@@ zip the program with tar in a matching folder and create the en@@ cyclo@@ pedia . the exec@@ utable file festival must be in your PAT@@ H .
download the voice file cz@@ 2 from the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ page and un@@ zip it with un@@ zip in the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ folder .
&quot; / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / cz@@ 2 &quot; &quot; / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / cz@@ 2 &quot; &quot; / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / cz@@ 2 &quot; &quot; / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / cz@@ 2 &quot; &quot; / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / cz@@ 2 &quot; &quot; ( require c@@ zech @-@ MB@@ RO@@ LA / cz@@ 2 &quot; &quot; ) &quot;
&quot; festival Lite is a free speech synthes@@ izer , which currently only supports a limited number of voices and languages . it is a simple speech synthes@@ izer with an even sufficient voice quality . &quot;
&quot; Fl@@ ite is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions , so look for Fl@@ ite first on the CDs of your distribution . &quot;
&quot; Ha@@ di@@ fix is a two @-@ stage speech synthes@@ izer which works with di@@ ph@@ ons . the program t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o transl@@ ates text into Di@@ phone and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; language quality is good , but the support is currently limited to a few languages . &quot;
download at least one German language file from the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA site and un@@ zip it with un@@ zip into the / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA folder .
&quot; copy either t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ or@@ c to ~ / .@@ t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ or@@ c or to / etc / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o , here the r@@ c must be removed at the end of the fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
on the card device setup select a voice and place the paths to &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o correctly .
epo@@ s is a free speech synthes@@ izer for Czech and Slovak langu@@ age@@ . it is a simple speech synthes@@ izer with an even sufficient voice quality . with &amp; t@@ ts ; you can only adjust the volume with this speech synthes@@ izer .
&quot; start kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr . on the tab card , click Add . select the Czech or Slovak language and Epo@@ s T@@ TS speech synthes@@ izer . in the input fields you can enter additional parameters for the programs . enter an epo@@ s -@@ h or say -@@ h to obtain more information . &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , source @-@ based speech synthes@@ izer written in &amp; Java , i.e. you need to install the &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . with &amp; Java ; neither pitch , volume nor speaking speed can be set . &quot;
&quot; the command module allows you to use &amp; t@@ ts ; with any speech synthes@@ izer , which can be controlled on the command line . &quot;
&quot; best use a command to write the voice output into a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) , instead of sending the output directly to the audio device &quot;
&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ Center ; that allows administration of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ Center ; allows the user to manage a range of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated interface . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package has been developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ Center ; for the user , create a simple interface for the following tasks : &quot;
&quot; after installation , a new module network settings in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center will be displayed . the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting the k@@ contro@@ l@@ Center ; Internet &amp; Network network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu ; &quot;
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot be installed . physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured to enable &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all shows and allows setting of network properties .
&quot; in most cases drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed when installing and installing Linux . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adapting the following files , according to the kernel version : &quot;
&quot; the network settings module will be loaded , if the option Network Settings in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ Center ; -@@ Index is selected . &quot;
&quot; if the platform cannot be recognized , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform from the list that best meets the distribution and Rel@@ e@@ as@@ est@@ and . by selecting non @-@ re @-@ en@@ quiries , the definition can be made permanently . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is only possible in system administration mode . previously all options are displayed gray , meaning the settings can only be considered , the change is not possible . &quot;
&quot; in the system management mode , the whole functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three riders : &quot;
the network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network interfaces are displayed . the following tasks can be performed by the rider network interfaces :
the settings displayed on the network can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button of the button ... setup in the dialog device .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Advanced Settings button to show the dialog with more advanced options . &quot;
&quot; in automatic mode , TCP / IP settings are performed by a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . the D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all required TCP / IP information at each system start , so no further setting is required . in the selection list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system . &quot;
&quot; in the IP address input field , the required TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field network mask the sub@@ net mask must be specified . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values entered in this dialog are shown as properties of the device in the device list .
&quot; it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the network , you can determine if the IP address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked . &quot;
network devices can be activated or switched off depending on your needs . switching on an out @-@ off network device will be activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
network devices can be activated or switched off depending on your needs . switching off an activated network device will be disabled by selecting from the list and clicking on interface ....
&quot; speci@@ fies the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net , which medi@@ ates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets . &quot;
&quot; if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located . &quot;
&quot; this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the machine ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org calls , DNS triggers this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
&quot; this list can be added , removed or changed . entries can be added , removed or changed . &quot;
&quot; by clicking the button Add ... from the group computer to the name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will be added to the New Name Server dialog . &quot;
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry is then inserted in the list .
&quot; from the group computer to name resolution , select one entry and then click the Edit button . dialog Edit is displayed . &quot;
&quot; the List of Nam@@ ely known calcul@@ ators describes host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address references for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily when bo@@ oting , if no DNS servers are available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS server . &quot;
&quot; usually , the list of Nam@@ ely known hosts contains some entries that support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . &quot;
enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add .... Add dialog New Ali@@ as is displayed .
&quot; enter the name of the known computer and click the Add button . if the known computer has multiple alias names , add the Add button several times and enter the other alias name . &quot;
select an entry of a name that is known by name from the list and select Edit ... The dialog on your computer will be displayed .
&quot; it can be executed one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts . &quot;
&quot; the settings made in the network settings are not immediately effective in the system . to activate the changes , the following command must be set . &quot;
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
&quot; for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) , it is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed . &quot;
the installation of the finished compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in one &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a graphical interface can be used like k@@ package or the installation tool of its distribution . &quot;
&quot; in this case the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; not , but in addition , the development packages are needed with libraries and other things . &quot;
&quot; this is recommended to experienced users only . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do this . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology will be given , and in the second section all configuration files are discussed by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf . &quot;
&quot; in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network will be provided . &quot;
IP networks are currently being run with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found widespread dis@@ sem@@ ination . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future .
&quot; one of the most important information is knowing the IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , on &amp; eg ; Work@@ place , the network administrator is the contact point to use a valid IP address or , if available , D@@ H@@ CP may not be chosen arbitr@@ arily ! &quot;
&quot; when setting up a small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways . &quot;
&quot; for smaller networks , addresses in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 are mostly used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own computer ) . the default route is required for the IP for@@ warding . &quot;
&quot; the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to its own lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed loop . &quot;
&quot; in this part , there are the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf and where they are stored in the different distri@@ butions . &quot;
&quot; this file is sometimes changed dynamically in DSL connections , so it is not surprising if there is another content found there in the case of active DSL connections . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; Su@@ SE , it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand than expected can therefore occur . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; is an application , with which you can run other programs on a schedule in the background . it is a graphical interface for the UNIX and UNIX system program cr@@ on . &quot;
&quot; at the start of &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; see a list of previously set tasks and associated environment variables . if you use &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; as root , this will be both for all users of the system as well as for system internal tasks . each folder can be opened and folded . &quot;
&quot; for a disabled task , the program name and parameter are not displayed and the description appears down@@ lighted . &quot;
the environment variables that appear here set out the otherwise existing environment variables for all of the tasks listed above . in a de@@ activated variable it is de@@ activated as a description .
&quot; to create a new task , first select the task folder . then go to Edit New ... Altern@@ atively , you can also click the Tas@@ ks folder with the right mouse button and press in the pop @-@ up context menu New ... or press C@@ tr@@ l ; N . &quot;

&quot; cr@@ on , for example Vi@@ x@@ ie @-@ cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses the c@@ ron@@ tab command to change the time schedules of the users . &quot;
&quot; a PO@@ SIX con@@ form@@ es &amp; UNIX , for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands from &amp; UNIX ; to experience time and date . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape . the first was to create a surface for tar , which also provided the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for fast , selective packaging . the second goal was to answer a question that my wife asked : how much longer does it take when you secure ? &quot;
&quot; before a tape can be used , it must be part of &amp; k@@ dat ; this can be done in three ways : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; check the tape back and read the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the tape . if you don &apos;t know the pre @-@ tension@@ er on the tape , you &apos;ll be asked if the tape should be format@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ dat ; the pre @-@ tension@@ er , searches for the appropriate index on your plate . if it cannot be found , you &apos;ll be asked if the band index is to be re@@ generated . &quot;
&quot; everything has gone smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape has been incorporated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched by opening the entry for the tape . &quot;
&quot; before ej@@ ecting the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; can be seen by changing the symbol for the tape , that the integration for the tape has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the tape can now be dis@@ car@@ ded without any danger . &quot;
before a tape of &amp; k@@ dat ; can be used it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat ;
&quot; tape drives need to be format@@ ted before they can be used to store data . this process does not match format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ dat ; this process does not require format@@ ting to be format@@ ted before use . flo@@ ppy disk drives usually require format@@ ting of tape , but DA@@ T drives do not require format@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; after entering the tape name and the capacity , &amp; k@@ dat runs ; with the format of the tape drive away . all data on the tape is lost ! after finishing the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and is ready for use . &quot;
&quot; before you start the backup process , you need to select the files to be secured . this can be done in three ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder will be backed up .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are secured .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select in the Save Menu ...
&quot; once the backup is started , the dialog opens for backup . in this dialog you can check the selected files again and change the settings for the backup . &quot;
&quot; the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . only the selected file or folder will be checked .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right @-@ click in one of the archives and select the menu entry ...
&quot; once the check process has been started , the dialog will appear for review . in this dialog you can check your selection and change the working folder for the review . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for the review , the dialog will appear . this dialog shows the progress of the examination process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can initiate the restore , the files that are to be restored must be marked . this can be done in two ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives belonging to the tape drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right @-@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore ...
&quot; once the recovery process has been started , the dialog will appear for recovery . in this dialog you can check your selection and change the working folder for recovery . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for the recovery , the dialog will appear . this dialog shows the progress of the restore process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
sometimes it turns out to be necessary to re @-@ create the band index file using the band content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can create the index in two ways from the band :
&quot; in this way , a safety profile with the currently selected files and the default settings is created . you can make the following settings for a backup profile : &quot;
the current working folder in which the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected working folder .
&quot; for all folders listed under backup files , only the files in it are backed up that are located on the same file system as the folder . folders located on other fil@@ es@@ ystems can be entered separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar independently of the others . &quot;
&quot; to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then are backed up . &quot;
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delete the snapshot file before the tar call . this causes all files to be backed up and create a new snapshot file for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; &amp; quot ; lt ; lt ; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set the settings over the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to device file for the tape drive ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding variant of the tape device .
&quot; this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is included , the command will be loaded to the drive . in some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed . &quot;
&quot; is the option enabled , tried &amp; k@@ dat ; lock the ej@@ ection at the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives . &quot;
&quot; if the option is turned on , the tape is dis@@ car@@ ded when solving the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; do not use this option for flo@@ ppy drives . &quot;
&quot; not all drives support variable block sizes . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you must tell &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case , notify the block size for your tape drive . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; K@@ dat ; a tape format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only occupy a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are as follows : &quot;
&quot; the band ID . the format of this string is the host@@ name : seconds , where the host@@ name is the full name of the system on which the tape was format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the epoch in which the band was format@@ ted . &quot;
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
&quot; the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it does not involve incre@@ mental back@@ ups . &quot;
check the contents of a tape . this symbol is only active when a tape is involved .
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a system log . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can obtain information about your system , or where the system provides the various protocol files . moreover , experienced users provide quick access to information about problems encountered on their server . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users , who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system stores the various protocol files . &quot;
&quot; moreover , &amp; k@@ system@@ log provides experienced users with quick access to information about problems encountered on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; hence , tries to provide some advanced features with which the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated . &quot;
&quot; in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include : &quot;
&quot; support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba &quot;
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you can see in the following screen@@ shot , &amp; k@@ system@@ log provides functions with which the individual protocol rows of a protocol file can be easily filtered and sorted . the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after the startup tries &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system log - will open . if you do not see this , and it opens instead of its a small message window , you usually do not have access to system administrator privileges . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar to filter after a selected criterion , or after inserted strings . &quot;
&quot; for example , in the protocol file system log , select the column process , and also enter the name of a process in the protocol file system log , so you &amp; k@@ system@@ log will show you all the protocol rows that have been sent or created by this process . &quot;
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol rows . protocol lines of the level errors are displayed with a more conspic@@ uous color as a protocol lines of the level indicator . the color representation of protocol rows can be turned off in alignment dialog .
&quot; if you want to display only certain process ( e.g. in the system log or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can select the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bar . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can activate the Add to new lines in the main window &apos;s context menu to show all new logging lines to be added . &quot;
&quot; to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub @-@ window , select a protocol to display . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. Where to find further information about the sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log , please click here . &quot;

&quot; welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and named in the following ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the V In@@ it system is quickly becoming the standard for the control of the program starts when the system is started in the &amp; Linux world . this is because it is easier to use , more powerful , and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD @-@ In@@ it . &quot;
I will not go further on historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
&quot; the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone might try to install a machine on System V In@@ it without a new installation and re@@ format . that &apos;s why you must make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there , if there was one . &quot;
&quot; the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it , and the following additional folders : &quot;
&quot; system services include such things as network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , ht@@ tp@@ d &amp; etc . system services do not include such things such as set@@ serial , which is started only once . such calls are to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; r@@ c.@@ local should be under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is not much use for it . you can also set up a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port . &quot;
the kernel searches in different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one it finds .
the default run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . in the initial area you should see a line like the following :
&quot; at this point you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the default Run@@ Level 3 is . if you want to change that , then you can fix / etc / in@@ it@@ tab manually and change the 3 . &quot;
&quot; but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you enter l -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you &apos;ll probably see something like the following : &quot;
&quot; you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory . &quot;
how does it start and stops in@@ it system services ? simple : each script is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop . you can actually run these scripts by hand on the command line :
&quot; this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one contains a K , the script is called with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script is called with the argument start . &quot;
&quot; some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; run a server running level that only runs ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc . &quot;
here you will learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
using &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another pointing device is simple to fail to say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the area of available system services to one of the six run@@ level to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts between Run@@ level@@ n or change the position within a level by pulling it somewhere else . this will not happen if you pull out an entry from the range of available system services .
&quot; note : entries will be moved when you move them to a new level . to merely copy them to a new run@@ level , you have to explicitly select Cop@@ y from the Edit menu or from the contex@@ tual menu and insert them into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action . &quot;
&quot; the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be comp@@ uted . in such a case , you will need to edit the Sor@@ ti@@ ern@@ um@@ mers of the surrounding entries , before you can try again to insert the system service . &quot;
note : currently there is no way to restore entries that were thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful .
&quot; you can use the Tab@@ ul@@ ator button to activate the different work@@ spaces ( Avail@@ able system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one . &quot;
&quot; to move one entry into another run@@ level , move it with cut into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it to the desired run@@ level with inser@@ ting ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change the sorting number or name of an entry manually , press the button to open the properties dialog . use the Tab@@ ul@@ ator button to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed . &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are removed from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise they will be recovered by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the preferences are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
&quot; I experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ level@@ n , and now the machine starts constantly new . what can I do ? &quot;
enter the LI@@ LO prompt lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
&quot; I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for running under Run@@ Level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( DL@@ D ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc which are available only in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution . &quot;
&quot; the way system services are launched in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not meet any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v are planning to expand the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you are using a different distribution , please check that all configuration files are available ( and also whether they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or ht@@ tp@@ d ) simply end without notice if their configuration files are not present or in@@ correctly set up . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use another distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level so that this manual can be added to this manual . &quot;
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
&quot; to start with &amp; k@@ user ; to start , it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; &quot;
&quot; after you have made changes , you need to save it . either use the corresponding icon of the tool@@ bar or the entry Save in the File menu . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two map cards , the user and the user group list . to edit , select the desired user or group with a double @-@ click on the entry . &quot;
&quot; some flash@@ cards will only be displayed when you have advanced system settings . only if you have activated space restrictions ( quota ) for users , a map card will be created on which you can customize your individual settings . additional map cards appear if shadow passwords or / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD univers@@ es . &quot;
&quot; the tab card password management appears , if shadow passwords or e.g. / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD univers@@ es . &quot;
&quot; this map appears only if for at least one fil@@ esystem space constra@@ int ( quota ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( identi@@ fiable to the file quot@@ as user / quot@@ as group on the file system ) . here , parameters can be changed for each user , whereby the space restrictions in KB are : &quot;
these parameters can be set individually for each fil@@ esystem . the current fil@@ esystem is selected with space limitation with the help of the field fil@@ esystem .
&quot; the map group informs groups about the group affili@@ ations of the selected user . the default group , to which the user belongs , can be found in the Pri@@ m@@ aries group . furthermore , the user can be a member in other groups by marking them in the large field . &quot;
&quot; the group &apos;s dialog features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or group , select Add from the user or group or click the matching button of the tool@@ bar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or group will work an@@ alog@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; with this module you can install the LI@@ LO boot manager , add , remove and change the boot password , change the time to boot the default operating system , add , remove , change operating systems , remove , change , and more . &quot;
