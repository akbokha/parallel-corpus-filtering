<seg id="2">"if a part of the text is selected, only this part of the text will be translated."</seg>
<seg id="3">"machine translations are only very rudimentary. in the best case, babelfish produces a crude translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, translations do not depend on important decisions without checking the translation before."</seg>
<seg id="4">Only websites on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated to the Babelfish page itself where you can insert translated text directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">"package & package; includes various modules for & konqueror; despite their small size, they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of & konqueror; by making these easier available."</seg>
<seg id="6">"for more information on the use of & konqueror, and the built-in functions, see the manual on & konqueror;"</seg>
<seg id="7">"to load these modules in & konqueror, select Settings extensions... Open the map tab tools and select the modules you want."</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of standard settings modules from the kde; addons. please note that you may have more modules on your system if you have additional software installed.</seg>
<seg id="9">"you should install the kdebase package, the & konqueror; it contains before you compile this package."</seg>
<seg id="10">"to use the crash module, click on the & Conqueror; on extras crashes. then you can view the page that caused & konqueror; to crash, or delete the list of crashes, if available."</seg>
<seg id="11">The module view filter (also called folder filter) can be reached in the & konqueror; menu bar under Extras area filter. with the module you can filter & konqueror; 's current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">"to use DOM tree view in & konqueror; to use, select DOM tree... and open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed website. as default, the display begins with the root node of the document, for example: the element, all other nodes are sub-elements of this root node."</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; provides a further view of objects with the MIME type inode / directory in local files. it can be used as an alternative to the different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the peculiarity of & FSView; consists of visualising nested folder hierarchies using a so-called tree map. each object is represented by a rectangle whose surface is proportional to its size. this size must have the property, that the sum of the sizes of the subordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object."</seg>
<seg id="15">"& FSView; reflects the size of a file or folder, and the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries is specified. thus, & FSView; as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; -command you will be considered."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in & FSView, an entry in the Treemap is a rectangle representing a file or folder in your file system."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the color of a rectangle, which is switched over view of color mode, can be either depth for easy recognition of the depth or mapping of another file property such as name, owner, group or MIME type."</seg>
<seg id="18">"a rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder. for each property, you can determine if it is displayed at all, only if there is enough space to display, or whether the area of the signed rectangle is to be used. in addition, you can set the relative position of the caption in the rectangle."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in case of Treemap for Treemaps, the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. at the Treemap in & FSView, this goal is not always observed."</seg>
<seg id="20">"depending on the layout of an entry for the subordinate entries, the implementation remains up to the implementation. in this context, it is always advantageous for the labelling and avoidance of space losses due to frames which are square. the best methods in this regard are lines, columns or recursive branches."</seg>
<seg id="21">"you can set the minimally represented area for an entry on the menu item View Anhold on Area. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn to the area of the higher-level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry."</seg>

<seg id="59">"like all & none; programs are also & digikam, an open source project. that means it depends on the support of the end users. therefore, you should report problems and improvements."</seg>
<seg id="60">"& digikam; tries to make reporting problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them. wherever you are in the program, the Help menu will open a page in the error reporting system. all required information is already registered here. just follow the instructions to send your report."</seg>
<seg id="61">"& digikam; is a project supported by a community. that is, users and developers can help each other. if you are a regular user of & digikam, then we would like to encourage you to answer questions to other users."</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digicode; visit homepage to learn news about shared versions and other information about & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="63">"the best start to participate & digive; to participate, is the registration in the developer mailing list. instructions for logging in the developer mailing list of & digikam;."</seg>
<seg id="64">"for the first time, you'll be asked where you want to save your images and your database. simply enter a local, remote or remote folder. simply enter the path name or click the Folder icon to select a folder."</seg>
<seg id="65">"in the second field, you have to specify a local folder on your computer. here, the data backup is saved. this path stays the same for all image folders."</seg>
<seg id="66">"later, you can add as many folders as you want. & digikam; will be additionally used as an alder library."</seg>
<seg id="67">"when you already have a picture collection on your hard drive, you can specify the topmost folder that contains images, as basic folder. & digikam; viewing each subfolder as an album."</seg>
<seg id="68">& digikam; durates recursively the library path throughout its depth. you can't exclude any subfolders unless it iste in hidden folder. this allows you to insert one point before the name of the subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="69">"if you have an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My Albenlist don't have any photos as symbols."</seg>
<seg id="70">"once you have configured the base folder, you can set up & edit your digital camera. then you should learn how to use My Albums and My Keyword list to manage your photos in the albums."</seg>
<seg id="71">"support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported shell cameras in the Help shell support menu."</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Roh-DecoderSettings and Roh workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">"an easy-to-use camera interface is made available to you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly into & digikam; albums can be downloaded. of course, any medium and any card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digikam."</seg>
<seg id="74">"modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash, Memory Cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission."</seg>
<seg id="75">"& digikam; uses the gPhoto2 program to communicate with digital camera. gPhoto2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely distributed protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows to transfer images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need of additional drivers."</seg>
<seg id="76">"many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer. since photos in general are large files and transmissions over the serial port are slow, this connection is now obsolete. & digikam; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link."</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 must have been created with libexif support so that thumbnails can be read reliably by some libgphoto2 camera operators. if the Exif support is not present in libgphoto2 you may not be able to see thumbnails or the creation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things to do & digicode is how easy it is to extend its functionality by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">"KIPI modules: the KDE Image Plug-ins Interface Project (manual) is an approach a common module structure for & digikam;, KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and Gwenview. the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section."</seg>
<seg id="80">"modules can manipulate images in virtually any way as it can also be a user. their advantage is that it is much simpler, & digikam; by writing a small module to add a function when the changes in & digikam."</seg>
<seg id="81">"to simplify the window, you can either remove the page strips with & LMB; remove or switch to full screen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F."</seg>
<seg id="82">"drag and drop images works everywhere: you can put an image in another part of the tree, above the horizontal divider line or another application window. the only limitation is that a picture cannot be stored in keywords, date list or search."</seg>
<seg id="83">"- a file type selection allows you to extract the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, Movies and Audio"</seg>
<seg id="84">"the text filter will only be used for the fields displayed in the symbol view currently. thus, filtering on the filename will only work if this is displayed in the symbol view."</seg>
<seg id="85">"view & quot; My Albenlistequot; provides an organized view on your photo albums. all photos stored by & digikam, are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted according to their collection in the legacy properties or by the date on which the album was first created, and the date can be changed in the properties of the album."</seg>
<seg id="86">"if you have set up a scanner, you can scan a photo directly into an album. select File Import images. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album."</seg>
<seg id="87">"to copy or move an image from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there. in the pop-up menu you have to choose whether the image is moved by moving or copying. simply select all photos and move them to the destination album."</seg>
<seg id="88">"an album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to collect information about this collection. to access the album properties, you have to right-click on the album and select album properties in the contextual menu."</seg>
<seg id="89">"album Collections: are a method to mark your albums so that you can be grouped under a common name. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do this in the collections for collections."</seg>

<seg id="91">"buttons eldest, average, new: these put the date on that of the oldest, the newest picture or the average of the album. to do this, first try to calculate the average of the images from their EXIF information. if this fails, instead the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder."</seg>
<seg id="92">"when you first recorded an album in & digikam, the first picture in the album is selected as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlistequot; this is to help you remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol."</seg>

<seg id="94">An album can always only be included in a collection and collections cannot be nested.</seg>
<seg id="95">& digikam; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the area My Keyword list at the bottom left of the main window. album collections have a different effect. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">"the image window will show you the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all images will be displayed in this album in the picture window. each photo will be displayed in a preview, you can adjust the size of this preview with the two magnifying buttons in the toolbar."</seg>

<seg id="229">This question should be answered by the explanations in this document. use or change to open standards supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">"virtualization is now available for everyone. so, if you have an old system that is important to read your images, please keep it and install it in a virtual machine for later use."</seg>
<seg id="231">"on the other hand, the advice is quite simple: each time you change your computer architecture, memory, and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards."</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialist print for the ability to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have planed the scalability and you want to enlarge the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition. you can copy this area and store it to a new record:</seg>

<seg id="236">"open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day no more software available that can read it, then you can create it yourself. this task is easier from year to year."</seg>
<seg id="237">"GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market. therefore, you should not use it anymore."</seg>
<seg id="238">"PNG has been developed as an open source standard to replace GIF. it is lossless, supports XMP, exinf and IPTC metadata, 16 bits per color channel and full transparency. PNG can recommend gamma- and chromaticity data for improved color assignment for heterogeneous platforms."</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as an image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a lossless compression algorithm (Deflate). there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative File Format is a license-free and open raw image format that was developed by Adobe Systems. DNG is developed based on the TIFF / EP format and committed to using metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers are now available to DNG and we hope to use the competitor Canon and Nikon.</seg>
<seg id="241">"XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a coding technology that allows users to embed their data into a file themselves. the file information is stored with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF."</seg>
<seg id="242">"many photographers draw it from an original of your recording, mostly in the raw format, to archive. XMP doesn't want to store the metadata separately from the image file, but it can also be related to problems when linking the metadata file and the image file. therefore, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put everything together."</seg>
<seg id="243">"the Dublin Core Metadata initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models. DCMI's activities include annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and enlightening efforts to achieve a far-reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices."</seg>
<seg id="244">"import images from the camera, the card reader or scanner. as long as the images are on the camera edium, you can use this as a temporary backup."</seg>

<seg id="301">"the default view is that all green pixels are equal. if the straight green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultraviolet light than the pixels in odd lines, this difference creates a grid pattern in the output. this option records the image a bit soft, but eliminates the 2x2 grid pattern using the VNG- or AHD quality method."</seg>
<seg id="302">"if this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic ink balance is used."</seg>
<seg id="303">"this setting is only used when the white balance is not set. standard is to use a fixed color balance, based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight."</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images get more details in four steps. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">"the standard is it the pointed lights, so the parts of your images are burned down because of the inability of your camera to catch the pointed lights as a continuous white. finally, you can try to reconstruct some parts of missing information from the top lights."</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general do not saturate as quickly as green and red. & dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions from the still non-saturated blue pixels. of course this is a question of how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">"if you select the reconstruct option, you get the option to set a level. here is a value of three a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each picture."</seg>
<seg id="308">"set the luminance value according to your taste. you probably need to set it slightly higher than the standard 1. however, this can be done later in the image options of & digikam; image editing. to keep the time for the demosainvoicing, you should proceed conservatively."</seg>
<seg id="309">A demo icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the partial raw data that many cameras have and which has a matrix color pixel. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or color design.</seg>
<seg id="310">"& digikam; and Dcraw provide you with three alternatives: bilinear, VNG-Interpolation and AHD interpolation. after some tests it looks like AHD interpolation (variable number of gradient) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw. bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result."</seg>
<seg id="311">"if you know the color deviation of your lenses, you can set the red and blue corrections here. this is certainly the best method for a color grading correction, as it is performed during the rough conversion."</seg>

<seg id="317">"the input profiles should suit the camera manufacturer and model you are using. not all profiles are created in the same way. currently, dcraw Gamma corrects not for conversions at 16 bit depth. this means that you have to perform the color mapping yourself."</seg>
<seg id="318">"there are other options like the Soft-Proof profile to emulate how your image would be returned from a device. this is very useful before you print image, as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors therefore can be very saturated."</seg>
<seg id="319">"for most cameras, it is quite obvious which colour profile is intended for. unfortunately not with Canon's models. therefore, here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. this answer is, of course, unofficial:"</seg>

<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was mainly written by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I mainly adapted it to & digikam; s concrete implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a color-managed workflow is the colors that come from your camera or scanner. with a color-managed workflow you can achieve that the colors on your monitor are similar to those of your camera or scanner and that match the colors you print or publish on the Web to those from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">"the purpose of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about color management. in addition, links with deeper information will allow you to make your own informed choices so that you get the desired result."</seg>
<seg id="379">"if your image workflow fulfills all six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about color management."</seg>
<seg id="380">You work on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB colour space. (see below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image editions are by e-mail or web where sRGB is the de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">"so if sRGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone, why should one use another color space and then have to worry about colour management?"</seg>
<seg id="383">"a visual example of sRGB Limitation compared to the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors we can see, the horseshoe region, and the colors in the sRGB colour space, the triangular region."</seg>
<seg id="384">"if you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some bigger color spaces, visit Bruce Lindbloom's excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces."</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to list my monitor if I chose to work only in the sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">"yes! whether you're working in sRGB colour space or not, you need to allocate your monitor, since sRGB is powered by sRGB. if you are working as a RGB color space, you either have to use your monitor on sRGB standard, use an appropriate monitor profile or both."</seg>

<seg id="388">"this tool provides five automatic corrections, which can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting any further manual processing."</seg>
<seg id="389">"the functions Normalize, Comparting, Automatic Termination and Contrast extend from the menu Correcting Automatic correction automatically try to make the most of your colors. you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo."</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaling the candlesticks over the entire image so that the darkest point is black and the brightest spot is as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">"in the same way, almost every brightness area produces the same number of pixels. sometimes the same amount of pixel results in the same number of pixels. sometimes it produces very good results when improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it also produces garbage. it is a very powerful operation that causes either miracles in an image or destroyed it."</seg>
<seg id="392">"automatic adjustment: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and light border tones and adjust the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram range."</seg>
<seg id="393">Extend the contrast: this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible range and a rejiustication of all values in between. this is only visible in balanced images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">"the white balance correction is somewhat limited because a color space with 8 bits per color is worked. if you can do the white balance in raw mode, which works in 16 bit mode, then your possibilities for correction will be better."</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by the copyright of Pawel T. Jochym.</seg>
<seg id="397">"the preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left side, both the original image and the preview of the target picture can be seen."</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the destination image has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">"at the top right, a histogram is shown that will change dynamically as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well-lit images, most pixels are very small luminance values."</seg>
<seg id="400">"the contrast of your result depends on shadows, saturation and gamma. the shadow alignment allows you to enhance or download the shadow details of your photos."</seg>
<seg id="401">"to play with the above checks, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the color temperature of the white balance. in this way the temperature and green values are automatically set."</seg>
<seg id="402">"in addition, you can set the white balance with the list of preferences. the following settings are available:"</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed.. You will get the combined result in the white balance. this is displayed in preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">"the Save as and Load buttons make exactly this. each setting of the white balance that you have set, you can save it to a text file and load it later."</seg>
<seg id="405">"the Preferences button puts all filter values back to their default values and the relative neutral white balance. note that even neutral settings will result in a different photo than your original. if you save them, your original image will be changed."</seg>
<seg id="406">"this coding requires more disk space, computing time, and is only available for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG."</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as to the editing of color profiles. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color mapping can be performed by the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed instructions for using color profiles can be consulted in the chapter of color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">"another important tool is to find sound grading in the menu. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time, so that you always need the same error and you always need the same correction. in the manual for sound evaluation you will find more information."</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you will find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">"colour effects, a solar factor effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a cantenet filter are available."</seg>
<seg id="411">"in times of chemical processing Solarisation, also called Sabatier, was an effect that was created when printing a partially developed pressure with a short flash light and then inverted the design of the picture. the result was a partial negative image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine."</seg>
<seg id="412">"the intensity controls the solar system. at approx. 50% intensity, the picture shows what is chemically possible."</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar process effect. the original image is the (1) and this process works (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation by having a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing.</seg>
<seg id="415">The name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Media aquot; and therefore a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts. Velvia offers very saturated colors for natural photographers. Velvias strongly saturated colors are also a number of photographs.</seg>
<seg id="416">"the neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repetitions the strength of the neon light. for large images, the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment."</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not uncommon that you want to correct the color contrast and brightness of the photos. you can experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. all your settings can be viewed in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result use the button OK and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">"in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation rather than increase it. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok."</seg>
<seg id="419">"between the complex tool Gradation and the simple denim thickness / contrast / gamma, the tool tonality correction is based on the improvement of exposure. even if the dialog to this tool works very complicated, you only need the area of the slider for the application intended here. concrete the three slide below the histogram."</seg>
<seg id="420">"the window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graph there are three slider that can be clicked into it and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas."</seg>
<seg id="421">"the easiest way to learn the operation is to move the control knob, and take care of how the image changes."</seg>
<seg id="422">"the original and preview of the picture can be viewed on the right. the preview will be updated dynamically, based on the image settings. on the left side, the following options are available."</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box it is possible to adjust the histogram with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for images of a digital camera the linear histogram is dominated by a single column. in this case the logarithmic classification is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">"three controls: the top one for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle sounds, often called gamma-values."</seg>
<seg id="425">"the three color pinpettes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input ratings of shadows, middle and light tones. in addition, there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment."</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output ratings enable the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output value interactively as in the input values. the compression of output values can e.g. be used to create a hidden image as background while something else is seen in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">"automatically: with this button, the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image."</seg>
<seg id="428">"save as and load: with these buttons, the set values can be saved in the file system and loaded later. to do so, the Gimp Levels format is used."</seg>
<seg id="429">"if you use this mode and the three color pipette, the input value is automatically adjusted for all shadows, means and sun tones. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the application values for red, green, blue and the luminance channels."</seg>
<seg id="430">"the Overexposure indicator option controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result."</seg>
<seg id="431">"below you see an example of the adjustment of the input applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original picture is marked with (1) and the corrected picture with (2)."</seg>
<seg id="432">"on the left hand side, half of the original and the target picture will be displayed. the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings. on the right side, the following options are available:"</seg>
<seg id="433">Modified Channel: this selection box allows to specify the channel to be changed by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">"in addition to this box, there are two icons to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for images taken with a digital camera, linear mode is the most useful. in this case, the linear mode generates a wide beam. in this case, the logarithmic mode helps."</seg>

<seg id="479">& digikam; provides three different tools for sharpening. each one of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">"sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and simple, but it produces, especially in dark areas, grainy images."</seg>
<seg id="481">"blurred mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture sharper. in fact, it sharpens no bit, it is more psychotropual. you can use it to remove atmospheric vapour and it makes a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyright protected by Winston Chang."</seg>
<seg id="482">"refocusing is probably the best of the three, as it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has various parameters for adaptation."</seg>
<seg id="483">"photos without focus as well as most digitalized images need a correction of sharpness. this is because the digitization process needs to be combined with only minimal differences to a color point. this in turn leads to sharp edges a bit blurred. SLR cameras usually require more retrograde sharpening than normal cameras for private users."</seg>
<seg id="484">"images in raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanners apply a field of focus while reading the image. if you deactivate it, you will get the control over your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">"in some situations, you can get useful results by focusing a photo with the sharpening tool. you can use the menu entry to call for corrections."</seg>
<seg id="487">"however, the sharpest technique to sharpen the tool sharpens the sharpness of the edges. in general, the most useful technique to sharpen one image is to refocus the tool. under refocusing you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw the image slightly softly is much easier than it is to sharpen. use the tool to soften soft marks and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unsharp masks is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should be tried first. an increase in the radius or the amount amplifies the effect. if you make the blurred mask too strong, the noise and the impression of grenades close to sharp edges will create."</seg>
<seg id="492">"the radius determines how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. therefore, you should preferably sharpen images in their final resolution."</seg>
<seg id="493">"the amount divides the percentage between the original and the blurred image, which is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set."</seg>
<seg id="494">"the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference in difference. thus, a minimum difference can be defined for an edge of the filter. thus, areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from sharpening and therefore beauty errors in faces, skies and water surfaces are avoided."</seg>
<seg id="495">"the original picture is the (1) and the processed image is the (2). blurred masking was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digikam; tool refocusing recreates a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyright protected Entfaging Filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Viennese filtering. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a blurred mask. you can start it from the menu by refocusing colors in image editing.</seg>
<seg id="498">"the Gauss's folding has a very long tail, which results in the mathematical result even from the source pixels, which are far from the original source pixels."</seg>
<seg id="499">"circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most pictures, the default value should be 1 good results."</seg>
<seg id="500">"correlation: an increase in the correlation can help reduce artefacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. useful values are 0.5 and the values near 1, & eg; 0,95 and 0.99. a high correlation reduces the sharpening effect of the module."</seg>
<seg id="501">"noise filter: an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce artefacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, the image quality is 0.03."</seg>
<seg id="502">"gauge the sharpness: this is the radius for the gauge 'sharpness. use this parameter when your blur is' sch '. in most cases, you should set this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a value unequal to zero, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">"matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in matrix size can produce good results, especially if you select great values for the circular edge or the gauge 'sharpness. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">"the storage as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocused parameters you have set will be saved for later, and can then be loaded."</seg>
<seg id="505">"try to perform all blanks, color and intensity corrections on the image before using the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise, you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible, but leave inconvenient artefacts later."</seg>
<seg id="507">"if you read and compress images, eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image."</seg>
<seg id="508">"generally, unsharp masks produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by the unsharp mask of a larger neighborhood used as sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="509">"theoretically, unsharp masks always have to produce artefacts. even under optimal conditions, it is never possible to remove the effect of blurring. the FIR Viennese filter is always at least as good as the blurred mask. the FIR Viennese filter is often better when processing small details."</seg>
<seg id="510">"below you can see a comparison between different filters, on a small unfocused image:"</seg>
<seg id="511">This picture has been made with an analog camera. the unfocussed result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>

<seg id="518">"if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings."</seg>
<seg id="519">"detail conservation p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of details. a small value leads to uniform smoothing over the image."</seg>
<seg id="520">"directional dependence Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions while a value close to 1 is smoothed in one direction. JPEG artefacts are best removed at a value near 1."</seg>
<seg id="521">"smoothes [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore set this value to match the degree of noise in your image."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothed."</seg>
<seg id="523">Repeat: specifies how often the algorithm is passed. normally 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">"angle stepwise since [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is selected small, it should also be small. make sure that small angles generate a long runtime. therefore, you should select this value as greatest and acceptable for your needs."</seg>
<seg id="525">"integral step width [0,1, 10]: integral step width in pixels. you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2."</seg>
<seg id="526">"linear Interpolation: the more quality you receive by selecting this option is minimal, but it doubles the running time. therefore, we recommend it to let it out."</seg>
<seg id="527">The Save as and Load buttons make exactly this. correcting errors can be saved in a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">"correcting image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a very long time and load a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Cancel button."</seg>

<seg id="535">"radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) used for the filter."</seg>
<seg id="536">"sharpness: controls the focus level. this value sets the pixel gap to the front of the filter to detect luminance changes. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or lubrication occurs again."</seg>
<seg id="537">"edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, the whole noise can't be removed or noise peaks can occur. if you want to remove a faint noise or JPEG artefacts without losing details."</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend either to change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend either to change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not influence the smoothing process of the image controlled by the details.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the Gammatolerdance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of darker areas which are typically more bolted.</seg>
<seg id="541">"attenuation: controls the adjustment of phase jitter absorption. this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius reacts to variations of luminance. if it is raised, the edges appear smoother when it is too high. it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for this."</seg>

<seg id="593">"since the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the color information is missing."</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infra-red filter applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is under (1) and the processed image under (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values generate a kind of aura in the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">"& digikam; filter film grading is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film grading on your pictures. this is known from classic high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. in order to increase the sensitivity of the films, the manufacturers mix big silver grains of the photo emulsion."</seg>
<seg id="596">"the film grabbing effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. the treated image gets a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life. if you want to use this special, gallery-like, street photographic, granular sight especially in your monochrome photos, you have to use this filter."</seg>
<seg id="597">"the controller can calibrate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although frequently higher values are required, to ISO-2400. if you need more grains, you can use the filter several times."</seg>

<seg id="604">"there are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100, to control this effect. the upper controller selects the pin size and the lower knob adjusts the contrast (smoothing)."</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the charcoal-recording filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">"& digikam; filter engraving shapes your picture in 3-D, as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn."</seg>
<seg id="607">"& digikam; filter engraving is a quick tool to restore your images with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well in pictures with a simple structure, where color is not the most important thing in the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey, monstrous landscape."</seg>
<seg id="608">"the depth allows setting the contrast of the filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting."</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distorting effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>

<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: similar to the shaft blocks 1 the picture is distorted with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects anytime with the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blurring effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">"zoom Unsharpness: blurred the image along star-shaped lines that emanate from one focal point. this simulates the blurring a zooming camera, thereby creating a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography."</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blurring: blurred the picture by turning the pixels. this simulates the blurring of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance blurring: blurred the image to produce the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to step back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">"blurring: blurring the image through horizontal motions of the pixels. this simulates the blurring of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photographing, camera."</seg>
<seg id="619">Softening blurring: blurred the picture softly in the dark and strong in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow. "</seg>
<seg id="620">Sharpness: blurring the image through random shift of pixels and simulates the blurring of an arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blurring: finds the color basins in the picture and blurred them without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">"mosaic: splits the photo into rectangular cells and then recreates it by filling with an average pixel value, new."</seg>
<seg id="623">"some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel this calculation at any time using the button Finish."</seg>
<seg id="624">"raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops to your picture. by doing so, it gives your images a wet look. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn copyrighted algorithm."</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of drops. since the droplet size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images.</seg>
<seg id="626">"you can stick with the & digipack; image editing area free of raindrops. use the selection tool to choose the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you start the filter raindrops then the area will remain free from raindrops."</seg>

<seg id="628">"if the picture has the wrong orientation, you can put it in the right direction by mirrors or rotating."</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo blowing is definitely one of the most advanced tools to increase a photo with minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">How can you zoom or guess the missing information? how can you get the missing information again or guess? the CImg algorithm used here makes a good job here. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. select Transform size change in the menu and specify the target values. the dialog box is shown below.</seg>
<seg id="632">"change the tool to size using a linear interpolation method to approach the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality, then try the tool for blowing."</seg>
<seg id="633">"many image processing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. spline interpolation for enlarging an image. & digikam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo blowing was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project."</seg>
<seg id="634">You must tell the tool how to change the size. these settings are available in the New Size tab and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">"maintain aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled, the new size will retain the aspect ratio of the original image."</seg>
<seg id="636">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothed."</seg>
<seg id="637">"the Save as and Load buttons are used precisely for this purpose. as a text file, each installation can be saved as a text file and then loaded again later."</seg>
<seg id="638">"photo-blowing is very fast with what it does, but it can last very long and pull a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish."</seg>

<seg id="640">"the editing of a photo is not only a frequently carried out operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to put together a picture. to cut a photo you just have to create a rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and pulling the rectangle, you will then see this rectangle while you move the mouse."</seg>
<seg id="641">"when you release the mouse button again, the area of the photo will be cut out. this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look like after cutting. you can drag the size of the area to be cut by dragging at the corners of the rectangle. you can create a new rectangle by simply dragging it with the left mouse button."</seg>
<seg id="642">"once you are satisfied with the cutting, use the Ctrl; + X button in the tool bar and the photo is cut to size (Ctrl; + X). use the entries file Save or File Save as in the File menu to save the newly-cut photo."</seg>
<seg id="643">"in the preview area, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio you have defined in the dialog remains intact."</seg>
<seg id="644">"in the tool After aspect ratio, you can specify orientation as portrait or landscape format. in portrait format, the larger value of the height and the cross-format of the width is always assigned."</seg>
<seg id="645">"the tool After aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same, regardless of whether you use centimeters, inches or any other physical size. you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio."</seg>
<seg id="646">"at the right end of the dialog, there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically."</seg>
<seg id="647">"in the dialog below, you can set the range for cutting to the greatest possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation."</seg>
<seg id="648">"the tool After aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you use the editing tool the next time, these settings are stored in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data will reflect the projected image and not the original image."</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the coiling help make it possible to hide help so that you can put your pictures together better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">"harmonic partitions are based on the principle of similarity. like the third elbows, harmonious triangles are a possibility to divide a rectangle in similar harmonic triangles at the diagonals."</seg>
<seg id="651">"golden middle: the golden middle is a division that is based on different natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the flower leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="652">"the golden division is the irrational number 1.618033988... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks, who used to create your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden divide at all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty."</seg>
<seg id="653">"the number derives from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc."</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides more fluid relief lines if you put together an image. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">"the golden spiral will bring you good results for your photos. compared to third elreins, the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition takes the gaze of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetrical visual stream on this way."</seg>
<seg id="656">"another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. this can be a line or different objects."</seg>
<seg id="657">"the Golden Triangles are also derived from the golden spiral. their vertices are the central points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are no equal triangles. diagonal to these lines can make a static object more dynamic."</seg>
<seg id="658">"if you use golden triangles to break your frame, create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your picture focus at one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles."</seg>
<seg id="659">The options Horizontal are mirrored and vertical mirrors can be used to reflect the harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">"with the Color button, you can set the color of the guides. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the guides can be invisible. in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image."</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate a picture at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">"if you make a photo, it is easy that you don't hold the camera vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture where things are rotated around an angle. you can fix this with the & digiplug; image editing and tool free rotation. select Transform Free Rotation and adjust the target angle."</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your image with the slider angle. the values on this slider are indicated in degrees. with the Preferences button you can set the slider to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture are shown at the top right.</seg>
<seg id="664">"for your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line. move the mouse pointer to position the two lines. after moving it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section."</seg>
<seg id="665">"after turning a picture, you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners."</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is the Automatically cutting function. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option smoothes the picture a bit after the rotation. note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are performed by a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will then automatically be recalculated. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">"new width: displays the width of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels."</seg>
<seg id="671">"new height: displays the height of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels."</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle to the left: shows the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle to the right: shows the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle to the left: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle to the right: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">"after adjusting the perspective, the image becomes a bit smeared. for a single adjustment this effect is small but two adjustments generate a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible."</seg>
<seg id="677">"after you have adjusted the perspective, you get unpleasant triangular holes at the corners. a way to clean this is to cut the picture with transformation cutting from the image processing."</seg>
<seg id="678">"a horizontal sheeting for example will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram. you can start this module about transforming scissors."</seg>
<seg id="679">Rotate your image by using the Horizontal angle and vertical angle. you can rotate horizontally and vertically at the same time. if you press presets the angle will be reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target picture are displayed on the right of the preview area.</seg>
<seg id="680">"move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the shooting tool to adjust your image."</seg>
<seg id="681">"after you have carried out the shear, the picture is blurred. for a single loop this effect is usually negligible, but two formulations are twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this."</seg>
<seg id="682">"after shearing, the picture has triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate this is to cut the picture with transformation cutting from the image processing."</seg>
<seg id="683">"& digikam; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the available formats therefore depend on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries are compiled. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digikam."</seg>

<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command-line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original quote from him is: do not expect from dcraw that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get better results with dcraw!.</seg>
<seg id="855">"first, select the RAW file that should be converted and start the module. the Raw Image Converter Window then appears in mode for a single image. with the Preview button, you can view the effect of your current settings on the image."</seg>
<seg id="856">"you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for the white balance. the main parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the image later."</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">"once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. JPEG uses a lossless algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes."</seg>
<seg id="859">"tagged Image Format, TIFF, keeps all information about your image and uses lossless LZW compression."</seg>
<seg id="860">If you plan to edit your images frequently or later use it otherwise you should not choose JPEG format because it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">"if you select JPEG as a storage format, the metadata contained in the RAW file will be stored in the JPEG file in the Exif information."</seg>
<seg id="862">"if you have adjusted your settings, you can start the conversion with the Execute button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel."</seg>

<seg id="918">"before creating HTML pages, you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas of content, layout and destination. in the following, each area is described more closely."</seg>
<seg id="919">"first, enter the title of the review and a description that should contain the HTML file later. on kphotoalbum; HTML example pages will see an example of these settings."</seg>
<seg id="920">"next, select whether a & photoalbum; export file should be created on the overview page. updated information about the export files can be found in."</seg>
<seg id="921">"finally, you can choose which information to display on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid that information is displayed to the viewer even without a description. for example, that all pictures are displayed by a party. you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers."</seg>
<seg id="922">"in this area, you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unambiguous, which is why they are not specifically addressed."</seg>
<seg id="923">"at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images, so those who have to look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, no longer download images, such as a resolution of 1600x1200."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time you have set. therefore, you can browse your images with low resolution, which leads to a lower transfer time. if you want to get a picture larger, it changes to a higher resolution."</seg>
<seg id="925">"in this setting, you specify the different folders and the URL where your site is stored."</seg>
<seg id="926">"for all your HTML files, select a base folder and select a new subfolder for each subsequent set."</seg>
<seg id="927">"first, you need to select the main folder where all your images are stored. this folder will be saved and automatically added to the location next time. this allows you to select either a folder or a KDE support protocol, for example:"</seg>
<seg id="928">"once you have created your images, you can verify that these are all visible to the viewer. if you select a URL for the base folder, a web browser, after the pages have been created, will be started. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder."</seg>
<seg id="929">"this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located."</seg>
<seg id="930">"the settings you have just described have moved all three to base folders or URLs. in these, a subfolder will be created, whose name you can set in output folders."</seg>
<seg id="931">"if you are on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & photoalbum; come together, you may want to create your pictures with these. you can of course add an HTML page to view the pictures."</seg>
<seg id="932">"with & photoalbum, you can export a copy of your images to a .kim file. these can import others into your database. the image properties are ex- and imported."</seg>
<seg id="933">"there are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or whether the file is only a link to images. the advantage of storing all images into the file is that you can get all the images together and share this file independently. however, the obvious disadvantage is the file size."</seg>
<seg id="934">"you can create a .kim file either directly from the File Export... or along with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file along with an HTML file, this will be an external .kim file."</seg>
<seg id="935">"an external .kim file searches the images in two ways. first, it searches the images that are in the folder of the .kim file. if the corresponding images are not found, then the images of the URL you have created when creating the HTML files will be searched. this is, of course, only possible if you created your .kim file using HTML export."</seg>
<seg id="936">"in the following, the dialog for the export of images is described which you can access via the File Export... menu."</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. you have the following three choices:</seg>
<seg id="938">"if you want to copy manual to the .kim file, you will need to copy the images in the same folder as the .kim file."</seg>
<seg id="939">"with the option Automatically close to the .kim file, copy & photoalbum; the images automatically for you."</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal zip files. since most images are already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not worthwhile to compress the files.</seg>
<seg id="941">"the last option of this page is to limit the maximum image size. if you send pictures to your friends, you might not want to send the pictures in full size, as the .kim file would be very large, for example, by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide."</seg>
<seg id="942">"if you import a file with extension .kim from the web browser or from the File menu..., & photoalbum will import the exported database as described in."</seg>
<seg id="943">"the wizard for import consists of four steps. first, you need to select which images you want to import, then, in which folder the import images should be copied."</seg>
<seg id="944">"it may be that you personalize the category people to the imported file (if you are a Dane), while this category is in your database. therefore, you will be asked in the third dialog window, which categories should be imported to the importing file and which categories they correspond to in your database."</seg>
<seg id="945">"in the fourth step, you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database. an example of this can be seen in the picture."</seg>
<seg id="946">"if you look at pictures of your Italian holiday and discover a picture with your friend, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is shown."</seg>

<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules using KIPI are very different so it can be that some modules with & photoalbum are not working. this is the disadvantage if you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">"the biggest difference between & photoalbum; and other applications that also use KIPI is that the other applications can arrange their images in albums: this is an album simply a folder. even if & photoalbum; this kind of order does not support, it simulates the order after albums so you can use the features with & photoalbum."</seg>
<seg id="962">"it simulates & photoalbum; the current album, which is simply the current view, so all the images that show you the picture preview at the moment."</seg>
<seg id="963">Next to the current album & photoalbum; the modules also have to hand over a list of albums. here & photoalbum; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">"if & photoalbum; s Browser shows the content of a category, for example all persons, then each entry of this category represents an album for the module."</seg>
<seg id="965">"so, for example, if you are using the category people, & photoalbum, so do so, so if you have selected individuals to view and share it with the module."</seg>

<seg id="968">"as you are used by any other KDE application, you will see a menu and toolbar at the top. under the toolbar you will see the window that you can browse your image database."</seg>
<seg id="969">"one of the main functions of & photoalbum; is the possibility to see each picture with annotations. this includes information about the persons appearing on the picture, where the image has been taken. if for example, on all pictures, Jesper is shown and all pictures taken in Copenhagen are included."</seg>

<seg id="1042">"these images often have a Moiré pattern or step effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called aliasing."</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the impact of these errors. generally see images with this property better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">"if you turn on anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray; more than one ray per pixel. this technique is super-sampling."</seg>
<seg id="1045">"& Povray; supports two methods of super sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursively because each pixel is split further and adaptively because the recursion depth depends on the calculated values."</seg>
<seg id="1046">"if you choose the first method, POV-Ray tracks a ray per pixel. if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the given threshold, then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4 additional points will be calculated, at a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays per pixel."</seg>
<seg id="1047">"the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: r 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:"</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">"the recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are monitored separately and can be checked for further subdivision. the maximum depth of recursion can be set with the depth value."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the creation of noise for the ray process called jittering. if you turn jittering, change & Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns."</seg>
<seg id="1051">"the last setting for quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray;, the diffuse light reflection is calculated. it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property."</seg>

<seg id="1663">"the optional AllKeysTo M is used to set all sounds that this instrument needs to tone with the number M. if your keyboard does not support a gunshot (GM-Patch 127), you can use a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which sounds similar to a gunshot."</seg>
<seg id="1664">"so if a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 (gunshot), it takes Patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"please note that here with the term drum patch the patch is meant, in which each sound is another percussion instrument (drums, basins, maracas, etc.) and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the same drum (as some keyboards have it)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to indicate how sounds are mapped on a specific channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as well as its presence. so you need to create 128 items."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several key maps for each channel and instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are mainly used to map tones to the percussions channel. take a look as an example of the supplied key maps.</seg>

<seg id="1673">"if you use the keymap option, the keymap will be used with the name for this channel. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored to change the patch on this channel. in this case, patch x is always used."</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for example to always use the percussions patch on the percussions channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for PitchBenderRatio specifies in which ratio Pitch-Bender events are multiplied. if therefore a MIDI file sends a pitch-Bender event with the value n, it is converted with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then redirected. the value 4096 is used to prevent decimal commas in the map file."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting is needed because GM says there is a keyboard that is supposed to play a pitch Bender event with the value 4096, to play a tone higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid."</seg>

<seg id="2038">"if there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups. it is necessary to create your own toolbar for each group. in any case, it is not too many, therefore you can create a toolbar with the name of the marker."</seg>
<seg id="2039">"once a toolbar is added, you need to add and configure actions."</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are rather self-explanatory. press the New Action button at the bottom of the window opens the editing mode.</seg>

<seg id="2043">Igitt! is that a ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">"to create a symbol that represents the action better, we will use & kiconedit; choose from the & KMenu;, Graphic Other Programs (or where else it is located in your distribution)."</seg>
<seg id="2045">"& kiconedit; uses 32x32 pixels by default, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit Size."</seg>
<seg id="2046">"please note that the created symbol does not only help you to remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;"</seg>
<seg id="2047">"with regard to the day start, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green is mostly called loose, starte, further interpreted), or should at least, a message to the user will be signaled that clicking on this symbol is started; -tag in the current document will be inserted."</seg>
<seg id="2048">"after creating the symbol it must be connected with the action. this happens through the menu with Settings actions setting... (in & quantaplus;) and select the desired action. in addition to the text box, there is a button, press it."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"select the folder in which the stored icon is located, select it and confirm with OK."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"press the Apply button and continue with other tags, if there are any, or confirm with OK to complete."</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want some common & quantaplus; add functions to the toolbar or it should be shared to a better overview by some separators into multiple groups. open the toolbar dialog via Settings Toolbar. make sure the tool bar you want is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">"after selecting the element that is to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar."</seg>
<seg id="2053">"for example, I would like to have a quick way to access the Konqueror preview. I will select it and add to the toolbar."</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how disconnecting support grouping. someone who does not know my toolbar could believe that the & konqueror; button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by using all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"after NeweXML does not exist, it will be created impediments, but your tool bar (s) should be stored in the right folder. please adjust its & descriptionrc; so that your tool bar (s) will be loaded (s) when a file is opened by the corresponding type."</seg>
<seg id="2057">"perhaps the most notable addition to & quantaplus, for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language that you like best. that's why this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use."</seg>
<seg id="2058">"before starting your own documentation, you might be able to check in the & quantaplus; repository, whether someone has done it for you."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"there are two parts in this process. first, you need to search an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; language. then you need to create the docrc file."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"# Section1.html section 2 = Section1.html section 2 = Section1.html section 2 = Section1.html section 2 = Section1.html section 2 = Section1.html section 2 = Section1.html section 2 = Section1.html section 2 = Section1.html section 2 = day 1.html tag2 = tag1.html tag2 = tag2.html tag2 = tag3.html"</seg>
<seg id="2061">"the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, you can now see in the & PHP documentation:"</seg>
<seg id="2062">"# KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntax.html..."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # from Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolders in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the shaft depth (except through reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the contents directory is referenced directly to a file (and consequently at the top end of the tree view & mdash; folder is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces affect nothing but make sure to & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resources files are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"for example, when writing a & PHP script, the documentation should be displayed directly for the mysql _ fetch _ array function. by selecting the function name and pressing Ctrl; H for context help, the documentation would appear directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file connector lines."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"a simple list of separated context elements that should be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;)."</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can easily save your docrc file and add to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (just how you entered your docrc file) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"if you are sure that these are good and worth sharing, send your docrc files to the & quantaplus; -Repository for use by the & quantaplus; community. you won't get rich, but proud to have worked with the best web development platform."</seg>
<seg id="2070">"with & quantaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share the failing resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:"</seg>
<seg id="2071">"the resources can be sent by e-mail to friends, partners or otherwise. at various locations there is an email-sending menu entry, such as the DTD DTD package (DTEP) sending mail, tool bar tool bar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the scripted tree."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where all others & quantaplus; users can download them. the contributions are checked and only made available when our team uses them as correct and useful for publication."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"when uploading, you will be asked for your private GPG key (the passphrase is not saved), or in the event that you have multiple keys, you can choose one. in the New Resources menu, the input fields have to be filled (URL preview can remain empty) and click OK to start uploading."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"uploading can be uploaded from the DTD DTD package (DTEP) menus, upload tool bar toolbars, and start from the contextual menu of files and folders in the template and scripted tree."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"after downloading a resource, before installation, & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing. in case of problems it warns and it can then be canceled. if integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed, a message appears with the statement of the originator of the resource."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"it is possible to work on XML language that is currently not supported by & quantaplus; however, creation can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files in tagXML format might be necessary."</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD Load menu and converting a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description that should be used. after that the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target directory name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype Definitions line: the string that appears in! Doctype tag like HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd should appear</seg>
<seg id="2080">"fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: when activated, & quantaplus; after converting the & descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option."</seg>
<seg id="2081">"in & quantaplus; there are some key concepts. in order to understand these and full benefits from & quantaplus, one must first familiarize themselves with these fundamental concepts without their understanding & quantaplus."</seg>
<seg id="2082">"in & quantaplus; the working area is divided into three areas: global, local and project-related. this distinction involves a number of components in & quantaplus;"</seg>
<seg id="2083">"global elements are available for everyone who uses & quantaplus; all that is selected as global is stored in the common folder structure of & quantaplus; this allows the group of administrators to secure various toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which will then be available to everyone in a multi-user environment on the system."</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a particular project. this can be anything from & CSS; patterns to toolbars with special actions especially for the files of a particular project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">"the & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of several main areas: the editor window, the building manors, the cartels with information and the toolbars. please check in, and for more detailed information about these areas."</seg>
<seg id="2087">"click the right mouse button to get a contextual menu with the current document, such as closing, recharging, deleting or uploading the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document."</seg>
<seg id="2088">"right-click in the Editor area leads to another context menu related to the edited document content, such as basic processing steps (cut / paste / paste), editing the tag under the mouse-cursor, or opening the file, if the string under the mouse pointer refers to a file."</seg>

<seg id="2090">"the use of toolbars is really easy. if they want to insert one simple tag, e.g. & lt; pgt; in your document, then click on the tag that represents the tag. if it is a day that has multiple attributes (such as anchors), you can fill in a dialog with different fields."</seg>
<seg id="2091">"the building manors (QIT;) allow you to navigate, open and browse them in the information about & quantaplus. in the presentation with carton filters are available for files, project, sample templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation."</seg>
<seg id="2092">"project management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus; this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right click. actions such as adding, removing, uploading or deleting the files from the storage media can be done with the contextual menu displayed."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"templates can be divided into three categories depending on which context they are used. global templates are always available, local templates only available for the appropriate user and templates in projects can only be used in the project."</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. so why & kdiff3? let me explain briefly why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was complicated because one of the contributors made a lot of changes and at the same time corrected a lot of text in many places. a further programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file.</seg>
<seg id="2283">"the program I used showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines. and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a small nightmare."</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters. later any amount of other useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">"for example, if you want to compare text quickly, simply copy it to the clipboard and paste it in one of the comparison window."</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparisons and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a full-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">The original file (the base) helps & kdiff3; the original file (the base) helps to resolve conflicts and at the same time display the expected result. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging them:</seg>
<seg id="2288">"& kdiff3; also helps you compare and merge complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3, while merging the folder:"</seg>
<seg id="2289">"& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you often have to check Kode, you will like this feature."</seg>
<seg id="2290">"differences in white signs and tabs are displayed. if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters, you can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no more trouble if someone changes the indentation.)"</seg>
<seg id="2291">"if a file is equal, and the other one differs in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both distinguish files."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"if all files have the same name but are in different folders, then you can make the typing work easier by using only the file name of the first file. for example:"</seg>
<seg id="2293">Folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">"opening dialog allows you to manually type file names, selecting a file browser (file...) or selecting a last opened file from the drop-down list. you don't need to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C blank, the analysis of differences with two files will be performed."</seg>
<seg id="2295">"in the folder folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the comparisons or merging of folders will be introduced. if for A a file is selected, for B and C, a folder, then used & kdiff3; the filename from A in the other two folders."</seg>
<seg id="2296">"if merging is enabled, the input field is active for target and can be edited. however, it is not necessarily necessary to create an output file immediately. you can also do this step later when saving."</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setting button will open a dialog with Settings. here you can set options before you start comparing / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">"sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to select text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window."</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or select text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">"what is the idea behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, it would be a relatively big effort. you only have to create two corresponding files, load them in & kdiff3; then you can simply copy, paste and then compare the relevant sections."</seg>
<seg id="2301">"note: at the moment, you can't remove anything from & kdiff3; only the drop of text into a comparison window is supported."</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors will interpret the dragging and placing text into another program than cutting and pasting (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case your original data might be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"the info line of the source pane contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that Windows C is optional.) Any info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, let the mouse rest for a while over the line. then a small aid window will show the full name.)"</seg>
<seg id="2304">"the three source windows are the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these preferences can be changed via the Settings menu.)"</seg>

<seg id="2940">"& ksystemlog; is a system log. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can obtain information about your system, or where the system provides the various protocol files. moreover, experienced users provide quick access to information about problems encountered on their server."</seg>
<seg id="2941">"& ksystemlog; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background. the task of & ksystemlog is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users, who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system stores the various protocol files."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"moreover, & ksystemlog provides experienced users with quick access to information about problems encountered on their server. & ksystemlog; hence, tries to provide some advanced features with which the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"in the current version 0.4.1, & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. these include:"</seg>
<seg id="2944">"support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba"</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">"as you can see in the following screenshot, & ksystemlog provides functions with which the individual protocol rows of a protocol file can be easily filtered and sorted. the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2947">"after the startup tries & ksystemlog; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system log - will open. if you do not see this, and it opens instead of its a small message window, you usually do not have access to system administrator privileges."</seg>
<seg id="2948">"you can also use the filter bar to filter after a selected criterion, or after inserted strings."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"for example, in the protocol file system log, select the column process, and also enter the name of a process in the protocol file system log, so you & ksystemlog will show you all the protocol rows that have been sent or created by this process."</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol rows. protocol lines of the level errors are displayed with a more conspicuous color as a protocol lines of the level indicator. the color representation of protocol rows can be turned off in alignment dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">"if you want to display only certain process (e.g. in the system log or in the Cron protocol), you can select the process identification (PID) in the column process. this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the samba server. in this case, use filter bar."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"in addition, you can activate the Add to new lines in the main window's context menu to show all new logging lines to be added."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a sub-window, select a protocol to display."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. Where to find further information about the sources of & ksystemlog, please click here."</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; can also be found in the Folder & KDE folder; -Subversion archives: ksystemlog; in & kde; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">"welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and named in the following) as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv."</seg>
<seg id="2957">"the V Init system is quickly becoming the standard for the control of the program starts when the system is started in the & Linux world. this is because it is easier to use, more powerful, and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD-Init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further on historical aspects (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because maybe someone might try to install a machine on System V Init without a new installation and reformat. that's why you must make sure that the old Init was removed from there, if there was one."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"the SysV Init also differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files are in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit, and the following additional folders:"</seg>
<seg id="2961">"system services include such things as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc. system services do not include such things such as setserial, which is started only once. such calls are to rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"rc.local should be under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is not much use for it. you can also set up a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches in different places after the program init and starts the first one it finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. in the initial area you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the default RunLevel 3 is. if you want to change that, then you can fix / etc / inittab manually and change the 3."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it start all the right scripts? if you enter l -l in rc3.d, then you'll probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">"you will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory."</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does it start and stops init system services? simple: each script is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop. you can actually run these scripts by hand on the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the one contains a K, the script is called with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script is called with the argument start."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could & eg; run a server running level that only runs httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you will learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Using & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointing device is simple to fail to say trivial: simply drag an entry from the area of available system services to one of the six runlevel to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between Runleveln or change the position within a level by pulling it somewhere else. this will not happen if you pull out an entry from the range of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries will be moved when you move them to a new level. to merely copy them to a new runlevel, you have to explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the contextual menu and insert them into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be computed. in such a case, you will need to edit the Sortiernummers of the surrounding entries, before you can try again to insert the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to restore entries that were thrown into the recycle bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the Tabulator button to activate the different workspaces (Available system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move one entry into another runlevel, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired runlevel with inserting (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change the sorting number or name of an entry manually, press the button to open the properties dialog. use the Tabulator button to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed."</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings are removed from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise they will be recovered by & ksysv; changes to the preferences are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">"I experimented with the standard runleveln, and now the machine starts constantly new. what can I do?"</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">"I have some system services with & ksysv; for running under RunLevel X, but they are not executed."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"if you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc which are available only in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the way system services are launched in these distributions, simplifies configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distributions, but unfortunately does not meet any standard. the authors of & ksysv are planning to expand the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you are using a different distribution, please check that all configuration files are available (and also whether they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) simply end without notice if their configuration files are not present or incorrectly set up."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the meaning of the & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use another distribution, please send me information about the runlevel so that this manual can be added to this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>

<seg id="2993">"some flashcards will only be displayed when you have advanced system settings. only if you have activated space restrictions (quota) for users, a map card will be created on which you can customize your individual settings. additional map cards appear if shadow passwords or / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD universes."</seg>
