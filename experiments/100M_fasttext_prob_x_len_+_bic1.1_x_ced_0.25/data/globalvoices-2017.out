&quot; although I visited the USA at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extraordinarily great .
&quot; like many of my generation , I grew up with American movies , danced to American music , read American writers and used his sports . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Peli@@ can letter , a fear@@ less re@@ porter who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , covered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil magn@@ ate , who wanted to occupy the highest federal court with judges who were interested in his interest . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; after Method Man , &quot; I was as if this is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that is what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the US had only intensified . &quot;
&quot; I always said , &quot; America is the only country I &apos;ve ever lived in whose variety is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I even wrote a very s@@ warming love letter about his great@@ ness .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascen@@ sion is for me as he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
&quot; with his mind , he never holds behind the mountain as it is said so nicely . &quot;
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague , and openly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ Americans and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people responded to his statements and voted in pairs for him . &quot;
the 13 million votes he won in the Repub@@ lican pre @-@ elections was the highest number ever reached by the party nominated candidate .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
&quot; who are the Americans who support this big@@ oted person , I asked myself ? &quot;
I couldn &apos;t reconci@@ le Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix .
&quot; as for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program , which receives people from all over the world , a deeply dev@@ out person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past . &quot;
&quot; the world outlook also did not agree with Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a &apos;s current editor , the current editor of the C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ quir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
&quot; s@@ ling@@ ing intoler@@ ance is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fought the environment for her life , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son . &quot;
she still fits to the dedication of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es who always helped me with much patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the comple@@ xi@@ ties of American life .
&quot; then there were Andrew Leck@@ ey , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career . &quot;
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
&quot; while Tr@@ ump broke his way to the nominated Repub@@ lican presidential candidate , they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception to the rule . &quot;
&quot; on November 8 , 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly White , presi@@ ded over a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his contemp@@ t against non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump because they either shared their racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart . &quot;
perhaps it is unfair to design@@ ate the Tr@@ ump voters as ra@@ cists .
&quot; assign@@ ing people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot;
&quot; this is superficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful , and implies an inability to understand those who act in a different way and think . &quot;
it shows people that their worries and fears over the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
&quot; could it be that these voters , of whom are white , voted for Tr@@ ump because they want to regain control over a country that she has disappointed ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they might say they are still important in America ? &quot;
perhaps .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick who comm@@ enting the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down on those who look different from him . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( Ü ) : &quot; white against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; ; the white and whi@@ pl@@ ash spread based on white and whi@@ pl@@ ash , as the great Van Jones described , has exactly killed what America has done so splen@@ did@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background you may have , America is welcome . &quot;
&quot; for this country chose as his president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose story as he himself says nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; with the election of Donald Tr@@ umps there is , however , a huge part of the White America &apos;s promise and says : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is back at the helm , they say . &quot;
&quot; all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
&quot; on a demonstration for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , would have a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot;
&quot; the crowd answered with a loud &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; do Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared .
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do Af@@ ro @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; cried they and their voices became lou@@ der .
&quot; if someone , who is not like you , would have a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; NO &quot; !
&quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , he is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the land , for which his son had fallen , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; that is now Tr@@ ump land , said the message . &quot;
&quot; and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could find no place in this new America . &quot;
and that breaks my heart .

from misery to the stars : these Latin American children cannot spoil their love for music by rub@@ b@@ ish

what is the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an town of C@@ ate@@ ura ?
&quot; the music played in both places not only changed the lives of the children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the tr@@ ash
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill , only 16 Kilomet@@ ers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists - but worlds away from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; for some years now La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( music ban@@ de ) has been playing in the community : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome poverty . &quot;
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest in the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the community , located in one of Mexico &apos;s poor@@ est provinces , is known for its drug abuse and gangs of violence . &quot;
but this changed after a chance encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered the youth a rare g@@ lim@@ mer of hope .
&quot; the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI : &quot;
&quot; as soon as they come out of school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion . &quot;
&quot; you always come laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the hu@@ stle you learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , Bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga . &quot;
music from garbage
&quot; more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero , the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village that is practically up @-@ to @-@ date at the largest land@@ fill site of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paragu@@ ays , are based on instruments made from recycled waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with recycled instruments made from local solid waste materials , manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycl@@ ers have begun to transform parts of waste into instruments . &quot;
&quot; instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double bass@@ es , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and percussion , all made out of the tr@@ ash . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , Paragu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article by the Los Angeles Times , Fa@@ vio Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , recalls the beginnings : &quot;
first it was very difficult because we had no place for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the tr@@ ash . the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live together with their children .
&quot; this changed as Fa@@ vio , something he had never seen before : a violin made from waste . &quot;
&quot; today , there is an entire orchestra that plays on instruments made of recycled material and which is called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra . &quot;
a documentation called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) records the musical performance :
the world generates approximately one billion tons of waste every year .
&quot; those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est - like the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they turn him into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspir@@ ational play of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played his music in front of Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and teamwork can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo © F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing .
&quot; this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports specifically about international , practical solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
the re @-@ release takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for sharing content .
&quot; in West Africa , it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Li@@ berian waters before it visited the other coast of Africa . &quot;
the East African countries were accordingly upset and inclined to welcome a criminal of this kind at their coasts .
&quot; in Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ es , Mozambique and the Seych@@ elles rapidly mobili@@ zed themselves against the ship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; recalls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was then expelled from the waters of the region : it was not possible to catch fish there . &quot;
&quot; finally , it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars in Liberia on account of pil@@ lage of the country &apos;s fish stocks . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 founded by N@@ RO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Stop Il@@ legal fisheries ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries that had then expelled the prime minister from their waters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; with this , we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and work together . they exchange information and support each other when it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , Head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust Project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project provides technical support for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , therefore it is extremely difficult to trace . therefore , illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing of regions . &quot;
&quot; due to the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws , by which certain habitats and species are to be protected , the illegal fishing ecosystem can harm ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance . &quot;
&quot; but while actions against illegal fishing were once ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also by the slu@@ gs that circul@@ ated between individual countries , actions happen today in real time , with trace@@ able to F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; there , for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news about suspi@@ cious activities or details that one had noticed or experienced during a harbour inspection . &quot;
&quot; fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive when they move on the open sea , via satellite data . &quot;
&quot; this allows the authorities to identify ships that are fishing in prohibited areas , such as those that indicate that a ship charges its caught fish on the way to other ships . &quot;
&quot; ideally , such examinations can show whether the involved ships have a fishing license where they were on the road and possibly also whether they have a criminal offen@@ se . &quot;
&quot; countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports on the basis of this information , which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the case of the PM . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is about significant financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer worth financially . &quot;
&quot; this is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , Managing Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting company dedicated to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the already mentioned platform was created to gain an estimated 20 million USD in lost sales , which the eight members of the H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i network lose every year because of illegal fishing , which inv@@ ade East African waters . &quot;
&quot; East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries , which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from around the world . &quot;
&quot; among other things , actions include sailing under false flag , fake license papers , fancy names , fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately util@@ ise the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of a not fully organised control system , &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; earlier a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could then say &apos; You may not run my harbor &apos; . &quot;
but another country could say &quot; Come to me . &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i now .
&quot; up to now , the closed front is working . &quot;
&quot; since its inc@@ eption , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i has participated in more than 30 studies of suspi@@ cious ships . &quot;
it has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has tra@@ cked and found escap@@ ing ships .
&quot; due to its co @-@ operation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority for comb@@ ating crime , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
he builds a system that aims to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to locate suspi@@ cious ships more precisely .
photo courtesy of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
&quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly being developed , also helps to track down the illegal ships that like to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to conc@@ eal their activities and their position , &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO that also deals with fisher@@ y data and offers technical support . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships , for example , turn off their automatic identification systems , so they can no longer be ordered by satellites . &quot;
Cop@@ eland is therefore helping to build a system that connects different levels of information . F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i will help to find criminal ships with greater precision .
a model program
but can F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations really influence the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes this . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform with Google and the ocean protection organization Oce@@ ana : a platform that offers satellite data and can display the position of each track@@ able ship worldwide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; join the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing - that &apos;s just meaning , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources for investigation . &quot;
&quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project in which a global system allows the pursuit of ships . &quot;
there are indications that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities do not only detect criminals but also deter them .
&quot; ships that used to be f@@ ished without a license and had hardly any consequences , now know that they are observed . &quot;
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i have now recorded a 33 % increase in fishing sales since fishing boats buy more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Somalia had helped to detect Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found tow@@ ing nets aboard . &quot;
photo courtesy of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that other countries now also copy , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we are a study object . &quot; &quot; in West Africa several hundred million dollars disappear every year through illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 six countries joined together to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . now they also fight illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; security is the goal of leaving even more such initiatives and structures in other regions too , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s latest member country Somalia was able to announce its first big triumph : in October , it presented Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship under false flag . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also inv@@ aded in forbidden waters that were reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time , proof that such a special collaborative working method for the protection of the oceans actually works throughout the world . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London . &quot;
&quot; their articles appear in Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , New York Times and Guardian . situation in Venezuela escal@@ ates further : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of &quot; re@@ covering the country &quot; &quot;
the street movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are considered to protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the inaugur@@ ation of President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

&quot; after Venezuela &apos;s government rejected the proposal of the opposition to a referendum on the inaugur@@ ation , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into the void while gathering on the streets . &quot;
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the recovery of Venezuela ) images of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them can be found .
&quot; the debate will also be conducted in other parts of the country , including in the Bar@@ inas area , in the regions of Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ chir@@ a , in the centrally located federal state of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Is@@ la Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the political and economic situation of the country is continuously worsen@@ ing , which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medication . &quot;
&quot; many representatives of the opposition saw in the inaugur@@ ation of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro the chance of a fundamental change , but in the end the reluct@@ ance of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , contribut@@ ors at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , sum@@ mar@@ ises the context of the government decision in its latest article as follows : &quot;
&quot; in the context of the social , political and economic crisis , in which the inflation and violence rates are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % for the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and wide @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine , the referendum was the only way to re@@ conquer its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance . &quot;
&quot; the election alliance Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ á@@ tica or shortly MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic unity ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined forces , called upon to continue the process against President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro &apos;s government , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government seat , on November 3 . &quot;
&quot; the call was commented on Twitter , among other things , as follows : &quot;
&quot; it is as far as Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday , nationwide civil war and on 3 November all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores palace . &quot;

&quot; the first demonstration in the framework of the action programme &quot; &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October . &quot;
&quot; the images of the mar@@ ches published in real time testify among other things an overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country , but also confron@@ tations with polic@@ emen as well as advoc@@ ates of the government . &quot;
one of the most common pictures shows a demonstr@@ ator crying out through the prot@@ ectors : &quot; will you kill me because I am hungry ?

&quot; on Twitter , images that tell about confron@@ tations , as well as reports of oppression and mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment . &quot;
especially big waves struck the news about police repression in the centrally located city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
&quot; there , the demonstr@@ ators pulled back to the local cathedral to protect themselves from the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government according to their own statement . &quot;
&quot; hours later they could safely leave the cathedral , but the protests continued . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an State T@@ á@@ chir@@ a : &quot;
&quot; the women in T@@ á@@ chir@@ a do not wear skir@@ ts , because otherwise you could see something that many National Guard did not have ! &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , an info@@ graphic already constitutes the round that forms the scale of repression per day : &quot;
&quot; thus , the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country . &quot;
many representatives of the government have challenged the validity of the demand for a ten@@ ure procedure - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets .

&quot; others are evaluating these protests as a further step in the fight against a government , which has taken a little bit against the devastating economic crisis from their point of view and would rather be involved to viol@@ ate critical voices : &quot;
they took us so much - but also the fear !
mar@@ ches are increasing frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported to the media that they were too hungry to participate in a strike instead of working or going shopping .

&quot; this is an adapted version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 on D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ ine news page . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and published here with friendly permission .
&quot; when he was 15 , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to witness the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city of Cór@@ doba . &quot;
&quot; as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now stands out against his father as part of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process in the province of Cor@@ doba . &quot;
&quot; in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes committed during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship were investigated . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not choose his life .
&quot; starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in the La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough . &quot;
he kept the family secret for 34 years .
&quot; in the situation at that time , I thought that was fine . &quot;
I felt like a secret agent .
&quot; as a child with 15 years , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father . &quot;
&quot; at that time , I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , torture and mur@@ derer . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was Gen@@ dar@@ meri@@ e@@ offici@@ o . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of state terrorism , his father was Deputy Commander of the Intelligence Department 141 in the La Per@@ la prison . &quot;

&quot; but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor , who is accused of kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and the kidn@@ apping of a 10 year old child . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ us &apos;s son , a man who , over the years , recognized the extent of the atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy , and who testified before a federal court against his own father . &quot;
his story shows what great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a way of salvation .
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts . &quot;
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my boy@@ friend .
he said :
&quot; you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have befri@@ ended one of the ERP . &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t forget that she will not kid@@ nap you one day , and I &apos;ll have to save you . &quot;
&quot; the abbrevi@@ ation ERP is for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of Argentina &apos;s Revolutionary Workers &quot; Party . &quot;
&quot; a few days later , he took me to work on the military base . &quot;
he told me that I would become a secret agent .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine .
at the military base I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners .
&quot; all sorts of documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , simply everything . &quot;

&quot; the prisoners are tortured , &quot;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la - all in 1976 .
&quot; at the first and last time , he let me wait at the entrance in the car . &quot;
&quot; when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a barracks , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - simply everything possible . &quot;
all of it was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a little pack wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to wear it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big l@@ ump of silver . &quot;
&quot; on that day , I went to the other end of the barracks , where the stolen objects were put off and kept me with a guard . &quot;
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tortured .
&quot; I saw in it , and saw a couch that was tortured by men . &quot;
she looked like a cot and metal feathers .
later I found out that they attached the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was tied there .
&quot; they rarely tied a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , poured it with water and pursued him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the smell there was app@@ alling ... like a dirty rebu@@ ke .
&quot; years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came from his room . &quot;
I realized the smell once again and it became clear to me that this is the smell of a body in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a person can do so much harm to another ?
I knew these people were killed
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and wore eye @-@ band@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian who was also indic@@ ted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked men were lying down with the face - all tied in their hands and feet . &quot;
&quot; in the vicinity of the entrance , people mun@@ ched quietly on the matt@@ resses . &quot;
&quot; when my father saw that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; Why do you look so , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot;
&quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Why have you brought me here ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew these people were killed .
&quot; they were cast into a pit , and killed and buried by soldiers . &quot;
I know that because my father told me about it at home .
&quot; in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero hit a man there and killed .
&quot; according to the survivors , Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also accused of trial in La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial , was accused of death by the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , head of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers . &quot;
the way you came in here is also the way where the kidn@@ apped came here .
&quot; if you look at the map , you will see that they took about this path and were then tortured for the first time . &quot;
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ isation .
&quot; when they survived the torture , the deta@@ inees were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from the top was supposed to be laid . &quot;
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of the people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; war yield &apos;
my father brought home all sorts of stolen things .
at that time I had no idea what the &quot; war yield &quot; - as they called it - was .
&quot; but when I was myself at the military , I was in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war spo@@ ils are a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military rab@@ bits that are fought against an enemy that has been fought . &quot;

&quot; but when one goes into a house and the fridge , the record player , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then it is not a boot@@ y but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
that is theft .
&quot; I have always wondered how my father , the leader of the security forces , could take part in this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was also an officer in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have liked to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my dad could do that .
once he called me a criminal and I replied : and you who steal cars on the street ?
you are not a criminal ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded rage , struck me , and cried : &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , I will find you and kill you . &quot;
&quot; for this , we need no one else ! &quot;
so my father was .
I have no good memory of him .
&quot; as I said in the process , I showed a photo of then , on which I wore a jacket and a roll @-@ collar pul@@ lover made of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he still brought clothes home . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the defence accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator in this crime . I replied , no problem , they can weigh me on what they wanted . &quot;
anyway I was there to cancel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the disappearance of the body is the last abom@@ inable act &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now that I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; once you have children , you recognize the value of a life . &quot;
one develops further and real@@ ises that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; well , so you executed people during the dictatorship , but why do the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
why kid@@ nap children ?
&quot; one day my father brought a girl home , whose mother had been killed . &quot;
&quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I always asked myself the question : they were tortured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
they would have been able to put them in jail .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why did their bodies disappear ?
did these people not also have families to whom one could hand over their mortal remains ?
enforced dis@@ appearances are the last abom@@ inable act to be done to a man .
&quot; my father told me when democracy was re@@ introduced , they brought machines to eliminate the mortal remains of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were crushed and disposed of somewhere - no idea , where . &quot; &quot; you &apos;ll never find anything , &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot;
but of course something stays always .
I have seen how you killed people !
just to clarify : I have nothing against the military .
I was even with the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just told the truth about 20 criminals - including my father .
the thought of showing my father was born during a conversation when he was placed under house arrest .
I made him accus@@ ations because of all the atro@@ cities that I had to experience with him .
&quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anybody . &quot;
&quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly rep@@ elled and asked me why all the exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; &quot; they supposedly defended were actually good . &quot;
then I cried :
how can you tell me something ?
I &apos;ve seen how you killed people !
you committed terrible crimes and you were forced to join me as a child .
&quot; he only replied , &quot; &quot; Please show me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
&quot; in 2010 , I re@@ marked the first ad . &quot;
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can repro@@ ach me that I am pre@@ occupied . I have finally said against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest pending before the end of the trial .
&quot; he was charged with 4@@ 16 crimes : among them severe , un@@ lawful de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 158 cases , torture in 15@@ 4 cases , murder in 98 particularly severe cases , torture followed by death in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of a child under 10 years of age . &quot;

the judgments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the magnitude of the judgment in Spanish .
&quot; after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial ended due to crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims in August . &quot;
&quot; 43 oppres@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity and sentenced to life imprisonment in 28 cases , and in nine cases prison sentences ranging from 2 to 14 years . in six cases there were acqu@@ itt@@ als . &quot;
eleven of the 54 defend@@ ants were killed during the trial .
&quot; # La@@ Per@@ la@@ imer : murder , torture and rape by officials . &quot;
&quot; all defend@@ ants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police and civilian personnel . &quot;
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was kidn@@ apped along with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he directed the following words to the silent chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory conceived by in@@ human heads .
the Court of Justice is a historical milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for years on justice for victims .
&quot; Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , lawyer of the Argent@@ inian organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , representing the children of people who were murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said : &quot;
&quot; the process took over three years , but the research for that lasted 39 years . &quot;
&quot; in March 2007 , the Argent@@ inian government handed over the country to La Per@@ la , so that there was a memorial to be erected there , which is now led by human rights organisations . &quot;

&quot; a translation error makes older people in Kyoto , too &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the sign with the translation error at a center in Kyoto , where you can extend your driving license . &quot;
the photo was spread in the social media .
editing of original photographs by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can pro@@ long their driving license , witnessed a very particularly failed translation last month . &quot;
&quot; the Japanese word &quot; &quot; Agent &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; older driver &quot; &quot; ) , which means &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; , &quot; was mistakenly translated into &quot; &quot; fear@@ some mot@@ orists &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself from 1 to 20 September .
edited the original photographs by Joshua Lev@@ ine which has been widely shared in the social media .
&quot; the mistake was the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , an inhabit@@ ant of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers . &quot;
the Kyoto @-@ published daily Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation corrected .
&quot; this is an insul@@ t to elderly people and in an international city as Kyoto is simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; Hol@@ mes said . &quot;
&quot; the fla@@ wed English translation was first removed . the term &quot; &quot; drivers &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; fri@@ ghtful mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate , although gram@@ mati@@ cally not quite correct designation &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tural police ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for correctness before it was published . &quot;
a blo@@ gger reported the following about the ap@@ ology :
&quot; we sincer@@ ely regret that older people felt offen@@ ded by the insufficient correction ( the translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News spoke a little more extensively with the phenomenon of &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; was denoun@@ ced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . &quot;
&quot; in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of total 19,@@ 4@@ 60 deaths were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 . this corresponds to a share of 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors created 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
this increased its share to 17.@@ 7 % .
&quot; while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has increased in the same period . &quot;
&quot; in the version of the article published on Yahoo , the non @-@ named re@@ porter brought comments to the light , which show which prejudi@@ ces some Japanese apparently he@@ wed against older drivers : &quot;
&quot; the article on Yahoo about the translation error was , among other things , the following comments : &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; horrible driver &quot; &quot; ) not the reality ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; So fla@@ wed is the translation really not at all , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a real translation mistake .
there are not few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread all over Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre bugs in English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Andrew .
the reasons for the widespread circulation of translation errors are manifold .
&quot; for transl@@ ating , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the source text and active language skills to translate it into the target language . &quot;
&quot; the latter requires the active command of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the conviction that translators in the target language - not in the original language - should be native speakers . &quot;
&quot; for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French into English . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies employ no staff with English as their native language , which could produce translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers studying Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies , who have no foreign employees , still allow translations to be manufactured in @-@ house . then , the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is appreciated as the best , is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widespread - often with fun results .
&quot; the confused and en@@ ig@@ matic sentences that arise through mechanical translations , show that this technique can &apos;t replace a human translator for a long time . this is especially true for a number of languages . &quot;
&quot; some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the en@@ ig@@ matic prints that often decorate t @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or understood at all . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry . however , from large corporations or government that have the means to ensure higher standards , it is possible to expect more careful translations . &quot;
&quot; in the future , the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for their translations . &quot;
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship measures on the internet and television
&quot; main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ ajo con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users announced that they had no access to Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay online . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that the internet appearances of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ o@@ lio TV are no longer accessible . &quot;
other online broad@@ cast@@ ers also recorded footage of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as organized by opposition groups who resist@@ ed the government Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros .
&quot; the protests began in early April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the tasks of the Parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court itself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ te . &quot;
# Zen@@ sur : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that the Venezu@@ el@@ an internet providers are blocked again .
this is from the @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net page .
&quot; offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with the Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; traditional media has been reluct@@ ant to report protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission threatened to punish them with fin@@ es and closures if they continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as &quot; calling for violence . &quot; &quot;
I returned to @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net without cable TV and informative national TV channels .
it is amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fel@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by blocking the domain name system ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . this also concerns the website where the National Assembly transm@@ its its sessions . &quot;
&quot; earlier research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . &quot;
&quot; if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server responds er@@ ron@@ eous or refuses the request when calling on such a website . &quot;
&quot; we confirm a DNS block : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net &quot;
&quot; V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , was broadcast on Thursday 6 April , when the V@@ PI@@ TV amer@@ aman El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who survived the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live . &quot;
Flor@@ es was beaten as he was in police custody .
&quot; eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on stream again . &quot;
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it is also reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections : this makes the Venezu@@ el@@ an access to multi @-@ media coverage more and more difficult for the current events in the country . &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to get an education &quot;
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ nar@@ a was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
&quot; today , T@@ ina struggles for the rights of children and ga@@ thers testim@@ onies from other Cri@@ adi@@ tas , who have been victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;

the following article is the shortened version of a report published by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors .
&quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en , &quot; which is processed and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot;
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family living there .
&quot; shortly before she graduated from the university , she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house proudly spoke about her . &quot; she &apos;s like a daughter for us . &quot;
&quot; the one who has become something , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
but T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a never was treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old she began to work as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . in Paraguay , the more than 4@@ 6,000 boys and girls , who are forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a large family with little money transfers their under@@ age son or their under@@ age daughter to another , weal@@ thier family . in exchange , the child receives food , a training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; however , what is not mentioned is that the children have to spend countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can be paid - and all that within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted . &quot;
&quot; this practice , described as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations . &quot;
&quot; after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls were affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and denoun@@ ced . &quot;
&quot; she tried to name things by name , because the feeling of gratitude that is inj@@ ected to the Cri@@ adi@@ tas is generally not silent . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ nar@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family , who in the belief that they complete their education , can improve their position in society and make &quot; something out of themselves , &quot; is transferred to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family who receives the girl and justi@@ fies their exploitation with the belief that they give someone a chance that otherwise wouldn &apos;t get any training and maybe even star@@ ved . &quot;
the Vic@@ tims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will experience it many years later . &quot;
sometimes they never experience it .
&quot; in January 2016 , the previously relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the secret of Paragu@@ ay@@ an households , got a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ ín arrived at the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed traces of violent blows . shortly afterwards she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
&quot; she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military citizen Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ e@@ jo , who worked as a civil servant at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt . &quot;
&quot; Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ rei@@ ra struck Mar@@ ín with a stick until she suffered fatal injuries . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
&quot; a few days later , the media reported about the incident . &quot;
they stressed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela were deeply responsible for the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society .
they called the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people gathered in protest demonstrations and called for &quot; no other Carolina &quot; to be allowed in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos was widely distributed in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered as children , &quot; T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ nar@@ a compla@@ ined . &quot;
without papers it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
&quot; without official documents , it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbours of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations called for rapid investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ e@@ jo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
&quot; if the case comes to court , the fall of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be a landmark - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a fall of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to court . &quot;
everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
&quot; the Cri@@ adi@@ tas are exploited not only as workers , they also live isolated from other girls at their age . &quot;
&quot; T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , in which her father worked , had to register bankruptcy and her father lost his work . &quot;
their brothers had to work all the time and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to make money .
but they all went further to school .
only T@@ ina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón as Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
&quot; in the house of their employers , Al@@ var@@ nar@@ a worked between four and six hours each day . &quot;
she had to divide the time in such a way that it was still time for learning .
she got up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for her employers .
&quot; on Fri@@ days , for example , she cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor . &quot;
&quot; when the school was over , she went home again and had time to learn . &quot;
&quot; the more they were finished with learning , the more free time she had . &quot;
but also this time was limited because they had to make supp@@ er for their employers .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ nar@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but did not get unlimited food . &quot; &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the master &apos;s library than food from the fridge , &quot; &quot; she recalls . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party that belonged to the Opposition during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; on some evenings the master Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced to stand beside him and read editorial from opposition newspapers such as &quot; &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo &quot; . &quot; &quot;
he tried to persu@@ ade them to give no faith to the official media reports about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; the owner had found someone who listened while talking about politics , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they didn &apos;t often allow me to visit my family , because they felt that I would &quot; &quot; learn bad habits &quot; &quot; there again . that means that Al@@ var@@ nar@@ a , who belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ ani , would once again speak their mother tongue Guar@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had allowed her to lose , she explains . &quot;
&quot; however , she was fully aware that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work . &quot;
&quot; also in school , Al@@ var@@ nar@@ a was discrimin@@ ated . &quot; a thing that almost never was spoken of is mo@@ bbing and har@@ ass@@ ment that Cri@@ adi@@ tas are exposed when they go to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents is a Cri@@ adi@@ ta . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to my home . I didn &apos;t have a circle of friends in school or in the neighborhood .
&quot; in my youth , in the time when friend@@ ships arise , I felt particularly clear that I belonged to no group . &quot;
&quot; the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ nar@@ a . &quot;
the company endor@@ ses the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share vac@@ ancies for cleaning staff and girls in Paraguay . &quot;

bill writes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

sixty Egyptian parliam@@ ent@@ arians have recently agreed to draft legislation on &quot; regulations concerning the use and usage of social networks . &quot;
&quot; when adopted by the Parliament , users of social media in Egypt must register at a government authority in order to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law , a place would then be established that is mand@@ ated to allow citizens to use social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months of acceptance of the law , users would have to register on the website of the site with their correct names and identity cards to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; if this fails to do so , it could bring a sentence of up to six months imprisonment or a fin@@ es . &quot;
&quot; the bill that consists of six paragra@@ phs and cur@@ ses in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that runs through the Internet and used to communicate with others by voice , video message and text . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear how the law will be enforced when it is accepted , as the draft does not give a clu@@ e to how the Egyptian authorities should not account for the registration at the time of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to regulate the regulation on the level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , parliam@@ ent@@ arian and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users received a user name and password from the telecommunications ministry to get through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
&quot; this could mean Egypt is planning to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . due to those , it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information on their identity to access the network . &quot;
but it is not known until now that such plans exist .
experts on the spot are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; Senior Research Biot@@ ologist &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things related to technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine that just as they control physically public and private rooms it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; if I take them seriously , that means they will be setting up a strong surveillance system to filter out citizens who request permission or not . and that is a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to bring them to a trial . &quot;
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt anything is possible .
&quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the legislative power of parliament and the constitutional committees before it goes to the plenary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether his acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft is in line with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in parliament , in whose sense the control should be maxim@@ ized and ensured that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration is present on the image surface , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , the MP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a bill against cy@@ ber crime in which a life sentence was intended for those found guilty of threatening &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; protest . &quot; &quot;

&quot; high up in the mountains of Kurdist@@ an in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the animal prot@@ ector H@@ ana Ahmed Raz@@ a and her team of scientists of the non @-@ governmental organisation Nature Iraq are working to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ard . &quot;
&quot; a sub@@ species of the bigger family of the le@@ op@@ ards , who fight through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a Par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . &quot;
why is this particular type of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; as Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; the Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining predat@@ or in the Kurdish eco @-@ system &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on a large predat@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the free wilderness is low and goes against zero . when the team in the video states that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera board , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy . &quot;
&quot; as a bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a is passionate about another side of her country , which is not only made up of war and conflict . &quot;
she has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs of nature Iraq for six years .
she has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and is committed to providing protection zones for wildlife in the Kurdist@@ an region .

&quot; in early March 2017 , the daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , the daily newspaper K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , documented the progress made in the last six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which is located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were forci@@ bly evacu@@ ated because the ts@@ un@@ ami had van@@ ished entire coastal towns from the map .
&quot; in addition to that , the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture experienced a nuclear accident , already because of that , 160@@ ,000 inhabitants had to leave their homes . &quot;
&quot; from a local perspective , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o &apos;s special report shows what progress has been made six years later to rebuild the life of the local residents . &quot;
the detailed report of the newspaper contains both the statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority and the survey results of those affected .
&quot; construction site in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that by December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement houses ( for the &quot; &quot; Device &quot; &quot; ) were completed in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i recorded the greatest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , where 80 per cent of the planned replacement houses were completed . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma with 70 percent is the final light . &quot;
&quot; however , still , six years after the catastrophe , evacu@@ ation of shel@@ ters ( &quot; &quot; Aus@@ ser@@ fs@@ wald &quot; &quot; ) , evacu@@ ated from the housing estate , cas@@ sa@@ vor@@ u ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u , can be reloc@@ ated into final replacement houses . &quot;
&quot; after the triple catastrophe , nearly 80@@ ,000 people were forced to live in shel@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 , 36@@ ,000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such dwell@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; nearly 40 per cent of the evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful here . more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ated evacu@@ ated after the disaster in Beh@@ el &apos;s shel@@ ters were res@@ ett@@ led into final houses . &quot;
&quot; for I@@ w@@ ate , the figure is 34 percent . &quot;
the state of work and everyday life in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures concerned
&quot; as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper could determine , 10@@ 74 of 1,@@ 100 schools affected by disaster have opened its doors by December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot;
six years later it is clear that industrial re@@ building in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
&quot; while nearly 100 per cent of the fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of the fishing ports have resum@@ ed their operations in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident occurred extensively in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of the agr@@ arian country .
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of the land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed land land of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma lie in the &quot; nuclear pl@@ ywood . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered largely , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains un@@ defeated . &quot;
&quot; the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are up to 90 percent on the same level as before disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can show only 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe nearly half of the coastal residents find it difficult to earn their livel@@ ihood . &quot;
is the native population prepared for the next great earthquake ?
&quot; in order to be able to determine the overall picture , the newspaper carried out numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacu@@ ated people . &quot;
&quot; in her introduction to the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o paper explains : &quot;
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the local population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents took measures to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
&quot; however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents find that still not enough in disasters prevention has been done . &quot;
how it is about those who had to be evacu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture
&quot; in its edition on the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the evacu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to experience not only the massive earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture was also a witness to the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed . &quot;
&quot; of 160@@ ,000 evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma almost 63 thousand people were moved to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 , more than 23@@ ,000 people were res@@ ett@@ led back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , in permanent replacement houses . &quot;
&quot; according to the 2017 state , there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; in the cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es , most of the evacu@@ ated refugees are still older than 50 years old . they are well known because efforts to rebuild Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma will have to compete with massive construction projects . &quot;
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; when people come across people from other countries speaking another language , the differences seem to be greater than the simil@@ arities . &quot;
&quot; after a while , however , one often sees that one more connects than it seems at first sight . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important , as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , extend our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , we look at these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep pod@@ cast we treat issues that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve . &quot;
&quot; we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members , who remember a moment when they felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders . &quot;
Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ man explains how a migration has consolidated its affection for Iranian culture ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences he has collected in a small village in Madagascar .

rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva in a widely used photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week : last Friday a police officer accused him of hitting his head during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ ana . nationwide millions of demonstr@@ ators participated in a protest march against austerity measures .
&quot; Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who studied social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ ás , suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures . &quot;
doctors operated on this Saturday and now transferred him to an artificial coma .
his condition is regarded as critical .
&quot; the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which quickly spread within a few days quickly in Brazil . &quot;
&quot; on the pictures is also the face of the police officer , who attacked with a stick . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o . &quot;
&quot; after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás acknowledged that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended until the end of the investigation . &quot;
the pictures show the police officers as he suggests in Go@@ i@@ ana with his stick on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
&quot; if a police officer was beaten up by a demonstr@@ ator and landed on the intensive care unit , his face would be seen on television for six months and the entire suppression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; &quot; Des@@ neur@@ aliz@@ ador &quot; , &quot; a media channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ ana , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z , in which you can see how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ ters shortly after it . &quot;
&quot; another video with the same scenes , but filmed from a different perspective , is also immersed in social networks . &quot;
&quot; in the clip shown below , you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second . &quot;
&quot; for the Mat@@ eus family who lives in another state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian Re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 Euro ) to cover a part of the cost of medical treatment and to stay in Go@@ i@@ ana while he is in hospital . &quot;
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus . &quot;
against police violence . &quot;

&quot; on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violent attacks against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás : &quot;
&quot; Go@@ i@@ ás experiences a wave of political violence : here the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish has been assass@@ inated by his father because he has been accused of the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . here , we have the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who was on the intensive care unit after being attacked by a polic@@ eman who struck him with a head@@ stock . &quot;
police Trans@@ actions
&quot; Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil , where there was brutal police missions on demonstr@@ ators last Friday . &quot;
&quot; at protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro , police officers set up a stage for speakers , rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas . &quot;
&quot; Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to renoun@@ ce violence against demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers across the country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media sli@@ pped street protests by focusing on another , unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window pane . &quot;
&quot; the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo were specifically reporting a broken glass window , illustr@@ ating their titles with a photo . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a bus set on fire . &quot;
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window of window than the protests of thousands of people serving the defence of a special cause .
this must also be recognised if one is strictly against any form of damage .
&quot; here too , the term &quot; &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; is an absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate meaning , and the typical acts of violence of the military police are concealed by head@@ lines with the title &quot; prot@@ esters on confrontation course with the police . &quot; &quot;
the Un@@ char@@ tered Villa@@ ges in Cuba
&quot; with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories throughout Cuba joined the doors ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta ) &quot;
&quot; the popular commun@@ e Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill , not@@ withstanding that there is no notable sugar harvest on site . &quot;
it was two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane mills were paraly@@ zed .
&quot; after the fall , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory gradually lost its plants until only the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of steel and concrete remained . &quot;
about 27@@ 2 workers had to re@@ invent themselves .
some changed the job .
others res@@ igned and commu@@ te daily to the factories that are still grinding .
&quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an who rises every day at 4 : 00 o &apos;clock in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not depri@@ ve his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that there are sugar cane mills in the east of the region , which are in operation after a long period of in@@ active time because they were received . &quot;
that was something he did not expect .
&quot; N@@ ene re@@ members that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar cane industry has already resist@@ ed the pla@@ gues , the fall of socialism , the low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad management decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 . &quot;
&quot; the news would have been a motive for concern for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are not news anymore . &quot;
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old platform of the congregation saw even better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane mills were technically outdated and hardly competitive they became unbe@@ ar@@ able for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories ; the annual production goal was 4 million tonnes .
they only left the factories that could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of the sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
&quot; however , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the report published by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations Agriculture and Food Organisation . &quot;
&quot; if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go into history , &quot; &quot; these were the first words of the Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ender . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began . &quot;
&quot; in the following years the shut@@ down of a total of 98 sugar cane mills , more than 65 million people , received their full salary for further education . &quot;
the same happened in the sugar cane mill Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has been working in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , talks about the closure of the factory , the word he repe@@ ats most is &quot; sc@@ am . &quot; &quot;
almost all those questioned are in the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would shut down .
&quot; in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first closing year , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; these were officially written documents , which were only distinguished in terms of the parts that would be removed , the address sat and the date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could approve any withdrawal . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the responsibility was transferred and the letters were getting more and more frequent . &quot;
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in operation . &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , waiting for retirement in another plant , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory in which he helped build .
&quot; with each part he removed , he disman@@ tled one of his 31 years of work . &quot;
the most developed industrial area of Cuba and most important work@@ tops was wi@@ ped out .
&quot; in many cases , there were no alternatives for working places and services generated in the communities in which they were present . &quot;
&quot; we will never know if during the Mam@@ mot@@ h speech of October 21 , 2002 , the former president saw in the eyes of the persons present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in use for five years , everything would go well . &quot;
the price of the population for closure of sugar cane mills
&quot; since 2004 , sugar cane has been extracted only highly by milling . &quot;
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; after two years , Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar cane factory closed , or rather , when they began to res@@ ign , they also stopped to asp@@ hal@@ ite the road , and this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories . &quot;
they were replaced with spare parts .
&quot; without the prospect of the future , many young people left the region . &quot;
&quot; in the area , a food factory was created whose production is not even for the provision of the church . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
&quot; at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene returned to the factory of Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work . &quot;
&quot; forty @-@ nine harv@@ ests bring the old soldier a pension of two thousand p@@ es@@ o a month , to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich . &quot;
&quot; Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a re@@ warding person , yet he does not forgive the lies he told him . &quot;
they have tor@@ mented him for ten years .
&quot; N@@ ene is in pension with age 65 , not because it lacks power , but because it is bitter . &quot;

first Nations youngsters use hip hop to express themselves and get their own culture
recording a song from &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo used with permission of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an .
young people of the First Nations communities all over Canada deal with topics that are important to them . they do this by means of Hip @-@ Hop thanks to a series of walking workshops .
&quot; as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an Tour , workshop leaders have been bringing mobile recording studios directly to schools and youth centres in 2014 to teach song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances . &quot;
&quot; the original workshops were led by the educ@@ ator David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and collabor@@ ated with ten Cre@@ e communities in northern Que@@ bec and then collabor@@ ated with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars . &quot;
&quot; the workshop is thus increasing that the young participants discuss topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , discourse , love , self @-@ acceptance &quot; or whatever comes into mind . &quot;
these questions are the inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the protagon@@ ists .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the US state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears . &quot; &quot;
the cases were mostly not elu@@ ci@@ dated .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs is in spite of the influences of globalisation .
&quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the teenagers did not always speak the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation has recorded , the refrain is sung on Cre@@ e . &quot;
the young people involved got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ stars Hip @-@ Hop group who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e dialect .
&quot; on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , the verse is available in tran@@ script as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German : &quot;
sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me
but I try to continue my days on Earth
this is the day when you will lose our cry
because as a youth we have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
&quot; in this way , they can grow and proceed as well as our youth . &quot;
so they can do what the Creator has appointed
&quot; in the commentary section , readers and supporters of the Cre@@ e language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also contribute and adds the verse in sy@@ ll@@ ables ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) : &quot;
&quot; in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant &quot;

&quot; in Japan , you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant . &quot;
&quot; to show potential customers exactly what is on the menu , in the vicinity of the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( the &quot; &quot; En@@ ables &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; Plas@@ tics Models of the Cour@@ ts &quot; &quot; ) are issued by any food served in this restaurant . &quot;
customers look at these plastic dishes and then decide whether they enter or continue the restaurant .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
&quot; in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a number of small companies that produce those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them any more . however , a new trend turns them into conspic@@ uous mobile accessories and other gad@@ gets . &quot;
&quot; at Na@@ ver Mat@@ omas , the B@@ logger it@@ ini@@ i has published a series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist to sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ gu@@ u . &quot;
now in special sale : new mobile phone tapes decorated with plastic dishes as they are shown in the Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
&quot; many of these artificial foods were turned into kit@@ sch@@ y collection objects , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets : &quot;
here are a few sho@@ oters fridge magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in food production is becoming increasingly more complex .
&quot; in this case , an imperial @-@ don ( a popular rice dish with seafood ) was turned into a cell phone stand . &quot;
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a cell phone stand .
also this part we made for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple that holds your cell phone :
&quot; designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the cell phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and that &apos;s just the beginning of an increasing flight into the coma .
&quot; some cell phone stand and cell phone designers allow you to create your own artwork . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a or Lach@@ s@@ wir@@ l is used , a popular t@@ opping served with white rice . &quot;
&quot; on Twitter , some users had doubts : &quot;
&quot; is there anyone who would say : &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile phone with laughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I &apos;ll be the only one .
&quot; this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appeti@@ zing form , in order to surprise colleagues or family members pleasantly . &quot;
our latest mobile phone stand has the shape of melting ice .
&quot; in addition , there are also rice balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands from dried salmon . &quot;
further quir@@ ky plastic dishes can be seen at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ter blog post . or follow on Twitter for the H@@ ash@@ tag # En@@ ables
&quot; if you want to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry . &quot;
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually made .
a Mexican project tells the stories of survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the fight against drug traffi@@ ckers . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; in reports of domestic and foreign media about the not@@ orious &quot; &quot; fight against drug traffi@@ cking &quot; &quot; in Mexico , the extre@@ mi@@ sts and interro@@ gations regularly appear only in statistics , but they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; the reports about drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict perfectly into the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the gri@@ eving or the churches that have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; behind every body , behind every bone @-@ find in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the Mexican news portal Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co has launched the digital project &quot; &quot; render a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; living with drug traffi@@ cking &quot; &quot; ) , telling these victims a voice and telling stories of people who were involved in the fight between law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els . &quot;
Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co describes the project like this :
organised crime not only makes us afraid of our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
&quot; for example , when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk . &quot;
the pain of the victims
&quot; a video entitled &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; how fear lives changed &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot;
&quot; a main character is Guadal@@ up@@ e , a father who searches secret graves after his son every weekend . &quot;
&quot; Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews on only a single day . &quot;
&quot; priests : &quot; like every Sunday , we prepare ourselves again today for the task we have asked ourselves to go and search for graves , according to the people we have loved . &quot;
Guadal@@ up@@ e Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
&quot; on October 13 , he left the house . &quot;
&quot; on October 15th , he should be back again , but he never came again . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need training . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , who is here with me too . &quot;
at the moment it has no income .
&quot; you are entitled to the insurance of my father , but it doesn &apos;t pay them out because they require a dying certificate . &quot;
where should we get it ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; render a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we need to show not only the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community conflicts , fra@@ gil@@ ity and state leadership . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co , wrote this article from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; your contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal , no matter what form it occurs : &quot;
I have been familiar with illness and sensation@@ alism for several years now .
I come across newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the titles with images that can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she continues to write :
&quot; no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 year old c@@ ousin thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealer ) when he is big . and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of offen@@ ders when they walk through the streets . &quot;
&quot; it is for me that as if they would ridi@@ cu@@ le those who have lost someone , and those who fear that something happens to them . &quot;
I see our weakness when stories become mere figures in a statisti@@ c .
the in@@ action of the people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighbouring village would be justified by the fact that they were &quot; so@@ oth@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; I think they are trying to convince themselves that they remain spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies , if they do not stir and are silent . &quot;
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the Capital District : how a family with threats was sack@@ ed . &quot; it describes how armed criminals squee@@ zed money from their business for month until they destroyed not only the business but also tore their family apart .
you think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your life in just a few days .
&quot; the pain never passes away , the trauma will remain , fear comes up again when you are alone . &quot;
&quot; habits have changed , phone numbers also . &quot;
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the farther we are from each other , the better . &quot;
she closed her report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will kid@@ nap you or kill you . &quot;
&quot; I asked myself whether weeping would dissolve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega &apos;s journalist published the article &quot; &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the introduction , he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime ? &quot;
how is it to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care about them . &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan is an orph@@ an and he says he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , cook potatoes , make tor@@ till@@ as warm and &quot; &quot; chi@@ chi &quot; &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine s@@ cars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ ably for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
&quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood was past two years ago , when he was just a few blocks away from his home , saw the bloody body of his father , shot by armed men from a car passing by . &quot;
&quot; born in Br@@ yan , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this : &quot;
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 as violence by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the Ci@@ tizen &apos;s Council for Public Security and the Government of the United States Government . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the public prosec@@ utor called 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to an average of 8.5 mur@@ ders per day . &quot;
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave organized crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country .
only a few stories continue to live in the face of ever new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; &quot; render a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co has launched the Nar@@ co@@ data journ@@ alism project in 2015 whose goal is to illustrate the complex information behind the failed fight against drug traffi@@ cking that has tor@@ mented the country over the last four decades . &quot;
when a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ UNG : this post and the pages to which it links , contain images on which violence is represented . &quot;
the fact check is important in a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing a fal@@ si@@ fication .
&quot; but how is the year after something appeared for the first time ? content in social media , whether it &apos;s true or un@@ true , tends to pers@@ ist . &quot;
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
&quot; since its first release , it has been mis@@ guided to find trage@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this false coupling of picture and event - &quot; &quot; false description &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; false context &quot; &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is plenty of careful reporting of events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but it raises questions about our desire for pictures to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a tank truck crossed the town of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , ti@@ pped around and explo@@ ded . 230 people died there . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second @-@ largest country had been neglected for years and thus devast@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; tra@@ gically , the tank wagon fell victim to it . &quot;
&quot; the authorities described a fire@@ ball that envel@@ oped dozens of houses , including a cinema close by , full of people watching the World Cup . &quot;
houses burned and scattered cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered throughout the streets .
many people were burned to infin@@ ity .
&quot; a picture with the title &quot; &quot; This is Nigeria &quot; . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Monkey , January 12 , 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the event form the horrible scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of char@@ red bodies that are lined up on the floor while people watch them .
but here history does not end .
&quot; over the years the same photo has been updated several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms and fal@@ sely attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
&quot; on 3 January 2015 , fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an towns of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on . &quot;
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dr@@ astic atro@@ cities before they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; no one stayed back to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; said a resident to Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many were dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of satellite images , the follow @-@ up time could be visually displayed . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the military base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military of Nigeria and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
and here the picture from DR Congo showed again when it was wrong@@ ly presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
&quot; a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris . &quot;
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this impro@@ per use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a number of abor@@ tions ; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in all these cases , the picture was presented as evidence of mass kill@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; one step further , personal comments such as this example fal@@ sely fal@@ si@@ fy the image from DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to deliver arguments . &quot;
the image of S@@ ange appeared in conjunction with the deadly persecution of Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a lightning report published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee were beaten , rape and several dead , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported about the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts appeared as follows , which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news page , which in 2012 fal@@ sely claimed that the President of Myanmar has said that monks and politicians had participated in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from DR Congo to illustrate this information . &quot;
&quot; the original contribution , which was recently accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot;
&quot; other news organizations that called AF@@ P as their source had also fal@@ sely attributed thes@@ es to this statement , but had not related the image from DR Congo . &quot;
the global reach of false information
traces of these false cros@@ spo@@ ons go back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; with the help of a &quot; reverse image search , &quot; you can see how far information can cross borders . &quot;
an inver@@ ted image search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 images below 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of 3 May 2017 ) 3@@ 44 pictures which are very similar to the mentioned image from the DR Congo .
&quot; they come from a mix of private sites , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
&quot; some have ro@@ uted false reports , some have tried to expose fal@@ si@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; we have defined examples of impro@@ per use and linked them to the respective countries , on the basis of which page they were published . thus , we want to represent the range more clearly than through the language alone . &quot;
&quot; from the countries listed below ( which in some cases were also inter@@ connected ) , several examples can be used for impro@@ per use . &quot;
here are some cases that can be felt completely ( on the orange map ) :
map : news frames .
country examples of false cou@@ ple@@ tions from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange @-@ coloured countries are pointing to pages or servers where examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or fal@@ si@@ fications are still available .
&quot; the countries in grey are examples that according to the metadata and information available via Tin@@ Eye , probably also for@@ gery examples . &quot;
&quot; as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;
&quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what is happening in Burma @-@ Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( directed at Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot; &quot;

&quot; in this paper a blo@@ gger from Que@@ bec City names not only the wrong information , but also discusses the abuse of the image from DR Congo in connection with Nigeria as well as further questions about the intentions of the persons and the trage@@ dies involved in it ( DR Congo and beyond ) . &quot;
&quot; Ecuador , 2013 . &quot; &quot; Nigeria est@@ án qu@@ em@@ ando a los cr@@ isti@@ anos &quot; &quot; ( in Nigeria they burn the Christians ) . &quot;
&quot; in this article about explo@@ sions in Nigeria , published in the newspaper La Rep@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , the district is identified as the Christian part of the place . &quot;
La Rep@@ ú@@ b@@ lica c@@ ites as its source the Spanish news agency EF@@ E ( although not known whether the original report has included the picture ) .
&quot; France , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; according to the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre like this one , who used the image from the DR Congo to illustrate the &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam , &quot; clearly there are no pages like Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster that refu@@ te this . &quot;

&quot; even within Nigeria , the photo taken from DR Congo as proof of the bombing of B@@ oko Har@@ am in K@@ ano was shared in public discussion forums . &quot;
&quot; Malaysia , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Malaysia offers two extreme examples of an ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from DR Congo , on the one hand a tweet , which expresses sympathy with the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger to deli@@ timi@@ ze the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are being mis@@ used . &quot;
&quot; Myanmar , 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the Myanmar government released a right to judge what it meant as &quot; &quot; pur@@ pos@@ ely &quot; &quot; news and photos , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings in terms of Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this rec@@ tification , which has been published exclusively in English , also includes references to fake images of rum@@ ors that H@@ ate Spe@@ ech operate and used by extrem@@ ist groups to demonstrate that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often dis@@ semin@@ ated by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) . &quot;

&quot; this post , directed to members of the Russian Orthodox Church , clearly states that the image of the DR Congo does NOT show Muslims to kill the Christians . &quot;
&quot; Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 . &quot;
this news page fal@@ sely claimed that the president of Myanmar has admitted Th@@ ein &apos;s 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture is still contained in it .
&quot; Spain , 2015 / 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this article from 2014 on students murdered by the B@@ oko Har@@ am published by the news page An@@ á@@ lis@@ is Digital has explicitly stated that the image does not originate from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that there is a similar &quot; jihadi@@ st attack . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when the picture later came into circulation in connection with the massac@@ res of the B@@ oko Har@@ am of 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is attempted to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria . &quot;
&quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ Dün@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ yu@@ y &quot; &quot; ( Nigeria burns , the world sleeps ) . &quot;
&quot; the picture of the DR Congo showed , with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion among Muslims after the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot;
they wanted to achieve a greater attention to these events that took place in the name of Islam .
&quot; United States , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the picture was weather@@ ed as evidence of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ret@@ we@@ et ) . but the messages related to it were not taken up in any religious context . &quot;
&quot; instead , the aim was to attract attention to the relative number of dead and a comparison of media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
&quot; Vietnam ( Vietnam@@ ese ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message which allegedly was written by a &quot; &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums like this here in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it false . &quot;
&quot; from the embassy in which the image was contained in the DR Congo , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ ine Mission@@ aries and Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos renoun@@ ced . &quot;
&quot; there are other confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; Tin@@ Eye also points to other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) , but are no longer fully track@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the craw@@ ler and spor@@ adi@@ cally they have image file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
&quot; in all these cases , which appeared clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture eventually bears a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and pictures
there are two strong themes or frames ( frames ) that pass through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photograph was used in relation to major discussions about the silence in connection with the assass@@ ination of Christians by Muslims or - to defend the Muslims - the assass@@ inations of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued compared to a European or French life .
&quot; to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts . &quot;
&quot; a deeper question , however , is what happens when readers can no longer believe in these images . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are tens of people who un@@ intentionally strain the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; suggests this mood of mis@@ conception and mis@@ information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and ad@@ orn the real horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ? &quot;
the spread of violent images has already been extensively deb@@ ated ( here for example ) .
&quot; one argument is that with@@ holding images of a refusal is equal to the recognition of the tragedy . sometimes , these images are even asked by the victims themselves . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the concern is that violent ima@@ gery is des@@ ensi@@ ti@@ zing readers and viewers , giving them the ability to em@@ pa@@ thy em@@ pa@@ thy ( such as this study , which investig@@ ates how violent media act on helping others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot to discuss about violent portra@@ y@@ als in the news media , the fact is that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting . &quot;
&quot; technologi@@ sts are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake News . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which an image suggests something , which can actually be used in the context or completely ab@@ u@@ sive way . &quot;
&quot; however , any investigation of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be . &quot;

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy Sim@@ mons is licensed under CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 License .
a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. uns@@ ur@@ pass@@ able ) tries to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or at all not to translate .
&quot; there are words in each language : they express certain situations or feelings , which are often very complex or specific . &quot;
some of these uns@@ ett@@ able words are already well @-@ known today ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) .
but everyone stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly resist any attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; a word or an expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes some context are required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists deal with Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages . &quot;
&quot; for example , in the blog you will find words from the VAT @-@ cla@@ p language of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; - Imag@@ ine your parents in recognition of how they are concerned about you in your younger years . &quot;
&quot; and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as : &quot;
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The comfort or la@@ z@@ iness you feel after cold days , war@@ med in the sun . &quot;
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog About :
&quot; they def@@ use other cultures , reveal other thoughts and aw@@ aken our curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you can influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page , and want to publish more of these &quot; uns@@ ett@@ able &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impres@@ sively these little languages are . &quot;
&quot; speakers of Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages , highly appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite words here . &quot;

how Sri Lanka ren@@ ders the worst flood disaster of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst floods in flood and land@@ fall in this decade .
&quot; due to strong rainf@@ all the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ agi@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya came across the shore in 15 districts in the south and west of the country . &quot;
&quot; after a statement from the disaster centre of Sri Lanka of 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of people are missing because of the floods and slu@@ dge . &quot;
&quot; over 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100,000 people were brought to 304 safe places of stay . &quot;
the rainf@@ alls continued on Saturday ( 27 May ) and the water levels in some areas slowly declined .
health and hygiene conditions of the population constitute a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
floods in Ta@@ wal@@ ama town with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . t@@ witter users such as A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the disaster .
&quot; Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods exac@@ erb@@ ate the Den@@ gue fever crisis , warns Save the Children after further rainf@@ alls are already on its way . &quot;
&quot; this morning the N@@ elu@@ wa bus was in high water , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also flooded because of the water level of Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations , and another five are completed for the transport of emergency deliveries to the residents included in their flooded villages . &quot;
various organizations and start @-@ ups have also agreed to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situations and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations please call 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for those who want to don@@ ate dry food and vital goods for flood victims -
today we are in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if animals in this area need help .
the taxi call @-@ app Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app to inform the disaster centre .
&quot; last year after the disaster of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me conducted a &quot; flood control &quot; button that allowed users to pick up a vehicle for pick@@ up assistance and donations . they were then sent to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross for free . &quot;
&quot; they also introduced a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; button , which resulted in more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for people trapped by floo@@ ding and land@@ slides . &quot;
&quot; the combined efforts of the government and civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully util@@ ised , bring residents in need of security and provide assistance . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of further human lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore normal@@ cy . &quot;

photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
&quot; use approved . in January , I attended the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and dear friend . &quot;
&quot; I trust in her four years old daughter , she confi@@ deth to me her children : she is my rock in the fire . &quot;
&quot; in the one minute , we are still calling slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights . &quot;
&quot; in the next channel , we are using rights for trans@@ gender . &quot;
&quot; we are in a sea of umbr@@ ellas and people , some keep the iconic picture of a woman with head@@ scar@@ f high , tied out of an American flag , others sc@@ atter slo@@ gans against Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; These things don &apos;t concern you , aren &apos;t ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
&quot; people with whom I work or people who know me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; &quot; Muslims &quot; &quot; that has built up in their imagination . &quot;
they ab@@ used me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t look alike all the same .
we practise our religion differently .
&quot; we identify ourselves with being a Muslim , in different ways . but somehow we are all plu@@ gged into the same Muslim drawer . &quot;
&quot; this drawer is so well constructed in our collective mind that as soon as Muslims , who do not fit into it , have to be mi@@ tig@@ ated . &quot;
need to be ab@@ used
I don &apos;t stand alone .
&quot; this is even done to the poet , whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i . &quot;
what images do you think of when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
when Jal@@ alu@@ d@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
&quot; Islam , the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the centre of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the Western notion , the religion of Rum@@ is was extingu@@ ished , as did the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a great part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another consists in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims who have already col@@ oni@@ zed Western books for centuries .
this enti@@ cing visual language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid de@@ composed the story behind these images in the 1970s .
but these images also stand out today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to ste@@ ak them . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ve been working in the news industry for thir@@ teen years , and I have seen how these powerful , fla@@ wed narr@@ atives dominate our news feeds . &quot;
&quot; this narrative over@@ shadows the reality that has led to nine Muslim women in the last three decades , while the US did not even choose its first female presidential candidate . &quot;
&quot; this narrative will fail to recognise that when French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ scar@@ f in public buildings and to cover Saudi , Muslim women by their government to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same coin . &quot;
a powerful group ex@@ erts its &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; other . &quot;
this strong nar@@ ration weak@@ ens Muslim women who conduct movements for change .
it is clear that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans that were hi@@ gh@@ tened with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of qu@@ eer @-@ Muslims .
this narrative has so deeply and er@@ ron@@ eous our collective imagination that Si@@ kh men and children often become the target of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and har@@ ass@@ ment .
&quot; because of these stories that we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is today not just fear of Islam , religion , but fear of &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
to the 1.7 billion include
&quot; in the news industry , we do more than telling stories based on facts . &quot;
or on alternative facts .
we also create nar@@ rations which help us understand the world .
and my industry has failed to grasp the narrative of 1.7 billion .
&quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims make up the highest degree of &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot;
more than a third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ American Americans .
six out of ten American Muslims belong to the first generation immigrants coming from 77 countries .

use approved .
&quot; four decades ago , my immig@@ rated parents came to New York to live their American dream . &quot;
&quot; my mother laid her first jewellery design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan . &quot;
&quot; back then , when Khan was re@@ thinking the world &apos;s sky@@ lines , my parents were w@@ ret@@ ched Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I now ir@@ responsible Muslims and Americans ?
&quot; sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of bringing out my Muslim recipes or my hand@@ some hand@@ ker@@ chiefs , which all Muslims carry with them - &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
&quot; I j@@ ok@@ ingly , we don &apos;t carry all T@@ ash@@ enk@@ or@@ ane with us . &quot;
we don &apos;t have to be the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be selected almost always for additional checks at the airport .
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who are trying to fight widespread lies about Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced at the current volume of a well @-@ lubri@@ cated Islam@@ opho@@ bic machine with credi@@ tors , think tanks and experts for false information that have already manipul@@ ated our already er@@ ron@@ eous picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories that we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is in more than just a stranger who tears the head@@ scar@@ f of a woman . &quot;
&quot; or as the sc@@ ary map of attacks on mos@@ ques throughout the USA , see below . &quot;
screen@@ shot of the AC@@ L@@ U website .
&quot; in its most ugly forms , Islam@@ opho@@ bia attacks our affili@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it attacks our identity , which is so expan@@ sive , so versatile and complex that it is impossible to fit into a drawer . &quot;

use approved .
I would like to explain that .
&quot; I was born as a Muslim but a Muslim was born only then into my imagination , when I was four years old , in a provisional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York . &quot;
&quot; when social scientists describe religious life , they come back to the following terms : belief , behavior and belonging . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbour , would see my rock in the surf , that I am Muslims when they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot;
&quot; she would see the evening ritual with my daughter , when I held her in my arms and whis@@ pered the Arabic verses to the protection that sealed the Koran and called the Q@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
I repeat each of them three times .
&quot; I ask that they are protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim belief is not always visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow . &quot;
&quot; the author &apos;s grandmother , when she gains an Ik@@ eb@@ ana competition in Kar@@ achi , pos@@ ing with her sisters at some point in the 1960s . &quot;
use approved .
belonging is the image of my grandmother on the mat@@ ernal side with her sisters ; as they gain a contest of art of flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi several decades ago .
&quot; it is the picture of her that I can see at this moment when I close my eyes : Nano , surrounded by her completed and un@@ finished paintings of the Su@@ fi Saint ; and a Koran with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , which she can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze . &quot;
being a Muslim means to speak the prayers that she told me when I have a bad day .
&quot; to be Muslims is how they taught me to relate to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people who - for centuries - have been col@@ oni@@ zed by an &quot; &quot; Empire &quot; , &quot; which established a company with the name of Ven@@ erable Bri@@ tische Ost@@ ini@@ dia Company , it has a deep meaning to call God , my only Lord . &quot;
the author 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
belonging means to grow up and hear that men do not cry but at the same time see that my immig@@ rant grandfather is crying .
&quot; in the meantime , while writing books on modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana Ja@@ an wept over his family in India . K@@ ash@@ mir , family , which he was not allowed to close in his arms in half a century . &quot;
&quot; affili@@ ation is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , whose families , as with my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who shared the Muslim world as at play risk . &quot;
to be Muslims means knowing that in the last two centuries Europeans have &quot; colonial &quot; all to four Muslim countries .
it means knowing that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was dropped from a Muslim country a century ago .
&quot; it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , c@@ ash@@ mere sub@@ tan of the British Empire , was described as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time , as he led the first mos@@ que in England . &quot;
&quot; before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world when I was ever and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;
the word of Islam .

to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion is deeply rooted in our unforgettable pedi@@ gre@@ es ; our un@@ acknowledged history .
&quot; it means remember@@ ing that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops distributed across every continent apart from the Antar@@ ctic , went to Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist . &quot;
it means knowing more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried under the ruins of the war .
to be an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has increased by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
&quot; it means knowing that when a tragedy hits the US and the suspect carries a Muslim name , the story is reported four times more than a story with a white attack . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago , the first call of prayer , the Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a liberated black slave . &quot;
it means knowing that a hundred years ago an African Islam@@ ist called Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country .
it means to call Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the heat that I feel as people over@@ crowded the airports to fight against Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we get up for our dreams and when we say black life count .
&quot; to be an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ erin , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ jab@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist , is the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple bin@@ dings , but to fail to communicate them to others . &quot;
&quot; the narrative of the 1.7 billion holds more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the reducing branch &quot; we &quot; against &quot; it . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to be a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people er@@ ect structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia on this two @-@ dimensional . &quot;
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia is in the Muslim regi@@ strar who started with President Bush and extended under President Obama .
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists in the immigration officer who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that prec@@ lu@@ des its borders towards people from just the countries that bom@@ bed it .
it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ fly @-@ list &quot; which is largely targeted by Arabs and Muslims .
these are the wars we are leading and the bombs that we reject on Muslim lands .
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from the Nor@@ th@@ western University showed a scientifically in@@ appropriate picture and asked them to assess groups on a scale ranging from 1 to 100 regarding evolution . &quot;
Muslims received the lowest score .
the Con@@ vers@@ ations That We Need To Lead
we are too deeply dar@@ ing to enth@@ use the Muslim or the &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; we are back decades , recognizing the roots of our fears and the faulty and dangerous image prints that we are ste@@ aling in our news agencies . &quot;
&quot; at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history . &quot;
&quot; Pod@@ cast Lake Som@@ e@@ thing , Sa@@ y Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ sters Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to print more Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IS@@ TA@@ N@@ IS@@ CH , Muslim , American super hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope . &quot;
screen@@ shots of media initiatives that want to show the complexity and inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of Muslim American life .
col@@ lage of the author .
but I &apos;m concerned because of this difficult global time point in which we are .
and that moment has consequences that go beyond 1.7 billion .
there is one reason why conspiracy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet now lead the White House .
they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
&quot; a few years before , it had not yet been given ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot;
&quot; I am concerned about the realities and the history that I was not aware of when I was so old , as it is now my daughter , but who have made me to become an irre@@ pro@@ ach@@ able Muslim . &quot;
things that I left here like a bread crust in my speech .
&quot; things that might aw@@ aken memories , because in all the inter@@ sections that make up our humanity , there may be a story where someone is made to another . &quot;
&quot; right now , on the other side of the Bridge in Berkeley , Con@@ vers@@ ations take place at the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; more than a hundred graduates talk about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural racism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot; &quot;
but these are not terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; why do I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who has shown us how wars are being led and people are enth@@ ron@@ ed by the creation of the &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; in public opinion , four decades ago even scientist of Stan@@ ford . &quot;
&quot; we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of this , consciously and un@@ consciously strengthening the &quot; &quot; other &quot; , &quot; as my girlfriend and I present in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the pre@@ occupation that we have no President , the chocolate cake , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot;
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art aims to preserve urban language diversity
&quot; story telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 . &quot;
can there be a possibility to get in touch with someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the initiative Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , the number of stories in their original language is a possible answer . &quot;
&quot; global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the inv@@ alu@@ able blog . &quot;
&quot; here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language variety of large cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has held events since 2015 , the risk that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there . &quot;
for the makers of the project :
&quot; the mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that embrace diversity - secure rooms , in which people do not have to forget who they are to belong to . &quot;
&quot; while &quot; listening often is connected with it , &quot; these events are used instead &quot; listening to appreciate , to feel , to touch . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers will first introduce and translate their story in their own language , or then explain them in English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants are not professional stor@@ yt@@ ellers , their dedication and representation enable the audience to get involved . &quot;
they cry out laughing and emotion as if the language is no longer a barrier .
&quot; the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ ara tells the tale of the rab@@ bits and the Pa@@ vian in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe : &quot;
&quot; after explaining the meaning of his fa@@ bel , John Ny@@ am@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is this to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in he shares his feeling of inclu@@ si@@ veness : &quot;
you have listened !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
&quot; so far , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling took place in three cities , and the organizers hope to expand this . &quot;
Puerto Rico calls for the United States to re @-@ establish public debt
&quot; on 3 April 2017 , several religious and bourgeois organizations took part in a mass demonstration with the aim of re@@ viewing the public debt of Puerto Rico . March 3 , 2017 , participated in a mass demonstration ; the march started at the Cap@@ it@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went right up to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the Old Town of San Ju@@ an . &quot;
it was proclaimed by the group@@ ing &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( citizen &apos;s front for the ne@@ ural testing of debts ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical assembly of Puerto Rico .
the advoc@@ ates of the re @-@ determination of debts also submitted a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; the people of Puerto Rico are demanding that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for debts are responsible for their corruption . &quot;
&quot; we call for a financial audit and a management board without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions corresponding compensation , which acts in favour of the economy . &quot;
we are black@@ ma@@ iled and oppressed .
the people of Puerto Rico refused to pay a debt that is not theirs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not find themselves declining pension payments .
we demand immediate measures .
the island - not in the United States - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
&quot; hence the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ profit organisation without party affili@@ ation with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , proposes a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state supervision . &quot;
these are their reasons :
Puerto Rico &apos;s economic and financial crisis requires a wide restructuring of state infrastructure .
&quot; without the participation and conviction of citizens , imposed measures are threatened by the people to be rejected by the people . &quot;
the demonstration bore the name &quot; Night vi@@ gil for light and truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :

&quot; this year &apos;s re : Pub@@ lica , the annual conference on digital culture hosted in Berlin , dedicated itself to an event of the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign . &quot;
&quot; Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ nay , a scientist of the France @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , a publishing house produced by so @-@ called &apos; Book S@@ prints &apos; , read excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ quiry ( The Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive Research ) . &quot;
&quot; the book , published last year and is available roy@@ alty free , contains a series of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression . &quot;
it is a homage to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it is said :
&quot; this book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built , and what the real costs are with which it is connected . &quot;
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and writers who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have been working side by side to view over the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create some sense from our different experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15 , 2012 . &quot;
&quot; his name was deleted from the directory of the A@@ dra prison , in which he sat on 3 October 2015 . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have no information about its present state or place of residence . &quot;
&quot; the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title Collec@@ tive Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce gives his friends and family a voice that will push for his release , and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , instantly . &quot;
&quot; seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have started thinking about their own fate , deeds and decisions . &quot;
why are we here today ?
what have we decided for ?
what have we given up in this process of temporary extreme convic@@ tions ?
&quot; since March 2012 , the web developer for open source and digital activ@@ ist has been in prison for Syrian government authorities . &quot;
&quot; in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred to an unknown place from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; &quot; military police bass@@ drum &quot; &quot; had taken part in A@@ dra as a &quot; &quot; top secret &quot; &quot; command of the military court . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by persons on 12 November 2015 who presented themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government and took note of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
his where@@ ab@@ outs remain unknown .
&quot; a pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowing for the general public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Siegel , a designer , techn@@ ologist and at the moment the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
perhaps none of Bas@@ sels &apos;s cultural prototypes was more pres@@ cient than the work he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ roads of numerous civi@@ lizations and here merge Greek @-@ Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Bass@@ el could not know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would do everything to wipe out this architecture , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world . &quot;
this strip in digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be inv@@ alu@@ able for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
&quot; tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el has not yet completed this project . &quot;
&quot; N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and wrote about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison : &quot;
&quot; I spent my whole life with it , dre@@ aming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace it . &quot;
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
&quot; Bass@@ el taught me English , even when he was already in jail . &quot;
&quot; I learned to read , write and speak English well . &quot;
&quot; he has always shared his knowledge with anyone who has asked . he has taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English . &quot;
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
&quot; he also taught other prisoners , how they use computers , at least theore@@ tically without actually holding one in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a pro@@ lap@@ se that she wrote in 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was in prison . &quot;
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a have worked together for a year together .
&quot; she smu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him , when she visited him and he translated them out of Arabic into English . &quot;
the book is available roy@@ alty free .
book cover from Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here is an excer@@ pt from the book of Nor@@ a titled &quot; It is happening . &quot;
&quot; it happens on every visit , &quot;
&quot; that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes , &quot;
&quot; that I lose control in the moment we embrace , &quot;
&quot; that every one of the dangers doesn &apos;t matter , &quot;
&quot; each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guards &quot;
I forget the crowds of the prison
and I go into every detail of your voice and words
&quot; which I carry with passion , &quot;
when your eyes say goodbye
and I leave another piece of my soul with you ...
&quot; I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness , &quot;
&quot; to rec@@ laim all the moments , &quot;
and to cry and smile about your absence .
I bear witness to myself that I will return soon ...
&quot; on the first anniversary of Bass@@ el &apos;s detention , G@@ haz@@ i wrote : &quot;
&quot; a year passes , my soul &quot;
while at the same time
&quot; I am in your cage , &quot;
and you are still in the cage of monsters
Bas@@ tide &apos;s history is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against the regime Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared , according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) . &quot;
those arrested or displaced by the regime were tortured or even executed .
&quot; by 2016 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in prison since 2011 . &quot;
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
today we repeat our demand in the hope that we have to do this last time .
Mozambique : post @-@ release director convic@@ ted of corruption on previous post
&quot; Mos@@ ambi@@ ans responded with anger to a corruption case , in which a government member returned after half of his sentence to the workplace in the state apparatus in which corruption was committed . &quot;
&quot; this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison in 2010 along with four other defend@@ ants because of the sc@@ attering of 54 million Swiss francs . &quot;
&quot; the money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique , whose Council presi@@ ded by Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 due to good leadership and immediately called for his re @-@ adjustment to the company which happened on 19 April .
&quot; in con@@ formity with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic who submitted the request , there would be no obstacle for Cam@@ ba@@ za to resume his old post , since the company did not complete disciplinary proceedings after his sentence . &quot;
&quot; however , many inhabitants do not mean the action well . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with Deutsche Welle , the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica ( C@@ IP ) , a local institution committed to public transparency , condemned the company &apos;s decision to put the director back : &quot;
&quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and exemp@@ li@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a reg@@ ression in terms of the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot;
what we are aware of is that even the firm should have initiated a disciplinary procedure against the infrin@@ gement .
&quot; however , the company was apparently silent and did not hesitate to take appropriate legal action to apply the corresponding functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , also re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case as &quot; disgu@@ sting &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent type , he would be a consultant , after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them were sa@@ wed . &quot;
he could hold paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches ; he could advise and polish his image .
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he cons@@ ents to be integrated into the company , which he helped to harm . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is gladly paid for his silence . &quot;
resist@@ ing !
&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , a young Muslim and student of political science in Brazil , says the director has no mor@@ als : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him , I can &apos;t believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that has so severely insul@@ ted the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks morality to return and serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but has instead served itself in the state itself . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as a source of an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man , who was accused and eventually sentenced to a long prison term . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remind that a th@@ ief is in prison : &quot;
&quot; thi@@ eves are in prison Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el will not only be remembered as the first independent president for the Mos@@ ambique , but also as a sharp , pier@@ cing and - inci@@ dentally - proph@@ etic or@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral representations was when he vigor@@ ously confirmed that &quot; an ambitious man is capable of everything , also the father@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest , to sell . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it &apos;s not like that . he changes the tactics , but he doesn &apos;t turn away from his ambi@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; an ambitious human being is criminal at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in Twitter , the reactions were also ref@@ using : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he was 10 years old and freed . &quot;
&quot; # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ OM@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is ( @ ac@@ mal _ Ra@@ fik ) , May 12 , 2017 &quot;
E@@ mil@@ do Sam@@ bo from the magazine @ Ver@@ da@@ de ( German @ Truth ) states that crime pays off in Mozambique :
&quot; in fact , in # Mos@@ ambique &apos;s th@@ ief and servant of the # F@@ rel@@ im@@ o , pays off . # Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , do@@ omed to a long time , returns to # airports of Mozambique - E@@ mil@@ do Sam@@ bo ( @ E@@ mil@@ do@@ sam@@ bo ) May 11 , 2017 &quot;
Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or spl@@ itting legs .
&quot; photo by San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Com@@ mons , Creative Com@@ mons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ ported &quot;
&quot; according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or in general use as ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; &quot; Indian &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Facebook cens@@ uses the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; En@@ ables &quot; &quot; as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alistic movements has given the word an extremely decreasing con@@ notation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word used mostly by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; may normally be associated with racism , but the word itself does not automatically call forth hate speech . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; many people have reported that even posts , in which they discussed the use of the word or expressed doubt for their use , were cens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same character sequence like &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , stools are written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ king A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because it contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way if they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a pu@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the phrase ku la - &quot; &quot; healing &quot; &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) in Bur@@ m@@ ese - is very similar to racial expression , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
&quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ ood believes that it will reduce the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be more analy@@ tic before it extingu@@ ishes all the posts that are suspected of spreading racism . &quot;
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it automatically filters the word .
the automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on Fac@@ be@@ ook .
&quot; what it should do instead , is to carefully analyse the mail and check it by checking the words side by side . &quot;
&quot; for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists , who spread hate speech , get quite a good lesson . &quot;
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to all those who hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long . &quot;
&quot; the experiences of social networks in China like S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the cens@@ orship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game , whereby users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or an alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored Word to express their views . &quot;
author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to delete his posts when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned from the social network :
&quot; when I became aware of this new Facebook directive , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my mail was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to collect , post and share content for 24 hours because the post &quot; &quot; Facebook Community Standards &quot; &quot; did not meet . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of messages from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
&quot; Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , who has nothing to do with hate speech : &quot;
post without hate speech from Facebook .
&quot; in the post , the author informed his opinion of why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad . &quot;
&quot; Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community ask for advice : &quot;
&quot; Facebook likes a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to l@@ essen racism in Burma through its platform , but it does not work like that . &quot;
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the various communities .
&quot; in addition , it appears as if they have started this without local context or technical support , and have forbidden such words as &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; heredi@@ tary cur@@ ry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the vulnerable posts . &quot;
&quot; if they only had a little more respect for the 15 million benefits , which gave them a big turnover , that would be great . &quot;
fac@@ ebook automatic cens@@ orship has provided for a lot of ridi@@ cu@@ le among users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun of Facebook and do not consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; in the context of hate language to see if their posts are taken off the net . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts containing no hate speech , but still removed : &quot;
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads : &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ a cur@@ ry and watch an Indian movie .
only to check if Facebook removes the mail containing the word Kal@@ ar .
screen@@ shot used with permission .
&quot; the post says &quot; If you are a doctor , then do you heal people ? &quot;
screen@@ shot used with permission .
&quot; over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence have risen . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate speech in social networks should additionally heat violence in communities in Myanmar , especially in Rak@@ h@@ ine area , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee . &quot;
&quot; Facebook was critici@@ zed for his failure , the balancing hate speech on his Bur@@ m@@ ese pages under control . &quot;
&quot; but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have looked better in the context than on code concentrating initiatives and learned from them . &quot;
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is the end of the children &apos;s marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .
&quot; photo by Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC B@@ Y 2.0 . &quot;
the to@@ e is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament of the country unanim@@ ously approved a law which should forbi@@ d this practice so that the marriage @-@ capable age is now at age 18 . &quot;
&quot; in May 2016 , Brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , leader of the Inter @-@ Religi@@ ous Organization ( IR@@ O ) , a group of representatives of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere , because that , age does not determine maturity . &quot;
&quot; this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago were a contractual partner of the UN &apos;s Convention on Child Rights , the min@@ ors as , every man under the age of 18 . &quot;
&quot; UN statistics for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children , who were married with 15 , was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and with 18 it was 8.@@ 1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office of the country confirmed that from 1997 to 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 . &quot;
&quot; online peti@@ tions and social media movements , which were ende@@ avor@@ ing to abol@@ ish laws on to@@ e @-@ marriage , followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring about this outcome . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hin@@ du leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about telling the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they were supposed to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this really complicated matter , and at some point there were doubts as to whether the opposition would agree to the draft bill . &quot;
&quot; but in early 2017 , the bill was decided against the children &apos;s marriage - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , who contained himself , so that he could be discussed in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him the law . &quot;
now only the president of the country has to agree and declare the law .
&quot; one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators posted a status update on Facebook , which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle posted on Inst@@ agra@@ m : &quot;
&quot; Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was voted in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 35 votes , and not one single vote against it . &quot;
&quot; having previously been approved by the Senate , the draft can now become a law . &quot;
the majority of social media users were thrilled because the laws on children &apos;s marriage were finally changed .
&quot; Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who is a minister of ministry in the ministry of education , said : &quot;
&quot; it took too much time and unnecessary talk which has concealed the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the children &apos;s marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and this is worth almost every price . &quot;
&quot; while Abel Jackson was of the opinion that it took a long time to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ ilt @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day had come : &quot;
&quot; public Status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which states : &quot;
the marriage has been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for that - 0 on the other hand ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ low Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group , who spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was , noted : &quot;
the age of marriage in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation of 18 years .
&quot; the draft for the amend@@ ment to the Court Act was adopted today , on June 9 , 2017 . &quot;
there are 41 de@@ pu@@ ties in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives and 35 were present at the vote .
all de@@ pu@@ ties who were admitted have voted for the law .
the marriage is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ like abuse .
many thanks to all activists who challenged him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our de@@ pu@@ ties .
&quot; but a possible catch comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the best @-@ known Hin@@ du organisation of the country . &quot;
&quot; months ago , Mahar@@ aj declared his intention to take legal action , should the law be passed , and he seems to make his promise . &quot;
&quot; while the General At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al ra@@ wi , an advocate of the law , said it was quite legitimate if Mahar@@ aj wanted to go against the law , most Social Media users wished that the debate on the subject would be different . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ r@@ ell suggested :
&quot; rather , sat , if we , instead of discussing the discussion so broad@@ ly , in a way that only could indu@@ ce panic and dis@@ grace , that the state , which protects them from the problem , would be ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled men who are in an advantage over them , &quot; would you then be ready to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
&quot; but whether it comes to judicial action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where the children &apos;s marriage is legal or still the norm , even though there are laws that they prohi@@ bit . &quot;
h@@ acker cast@@ ors the office of the public prosec@@ utor in front of the national protests on the Russian National Day

&quot; on the eve of the national demonstrations against corruption , which coinci@@ ded with the day of Russia - the Russian national holiday , the site of the prosec@@ utor of the district Y@@ ar@@ os@@ lav@@ l was hack@@ ed . &quot;
or we will bring you into the jail instead of Dim@@ on . &quot;

&quot; at 11.@@ 15 , the message was removed from the site - however , it remained in the cache . &quot;

&quot; on Sunday , the Office of the Prosecutor announced the local news service Y@@ ar@@ News that they were hack@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; by mirr@@ oring web pages , Turkish users can view Wikipedia &apos;s contents again &quot;
&quot; the Wikipedia page was presented on January 18 , 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the USA , dark@@ ened internationally . &quot;
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
&quot; for more than a month now , Turkey has now closed its popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; day by day , it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share reliable information . &quot;
both students and re@@ porters and fans of TV series are resist@@ ing the blocking .
&quot; although many tech @-@ sav@@ vy Internet users are used to use conversion tools for blocked web sites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ valence of the world ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia since 2008 , as recently described in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ages of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted . &quot;
&quot; according to China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform remains locked , there are now several mirrors ( pages that mirror the contents of Wikipedia and are often updated ) . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform deposited all Turkish Wikipedia articles on its decentr@@ alized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( i.e. calcul@@ ator computer connections ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult . &quot;
&quot; in spite of the legal prohibition , however , the content is available . &quot;
&quot; in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about its efforts : &quot;
&quot; after listening to the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we used everything to take snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the ability to read the contents on a decentr@@ alized and distributed way is possible . &quot;
this can help users to at least view all Wikipedia content even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org .
&quot; IP@@ FS also indicated that this step was conducted independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is merely screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website . &quot;
&quot; however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock . &quot;

&quot; you access a different URL , which is not the original . that what you see is from Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; in essence , the server continues the request to the correct Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia themselves if they are locked in Turkey . &quot;
this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .

Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were vag@@ ue with poorly positioned motives and washed colours .
this motivated him to carry a camera himself and try to bury the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring Nepal &apos;s animal world to the international stage . &quot;
&quot; and his hom@@ etown , right next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife . &quot;
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ class location helped him with his work :
&quot; I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! ! &quot;
&quot; I rested at home , when suddenly Navar@@ re called me ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river would be a le@@ op@@ ard . &quot;
the river dam@@ m is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father had watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the le@@ op@@ ard was located and I immediately started to kne@@ el pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar asp@@ ires to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for N@@ ept@@ une Nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
&quot; and he ought to know &#91; it &#93; , for he stood against tig@@ ers face to face with face to face : &quot;
a tiger can &apos;t be bot@@ her@@ ed by the opinion of the sheep while sleeping ! !
late in the evening . light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
&quot; also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the king of the boy appeared . he immediately began to see us and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al trees ! ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar places the logo &quot; I click for conservation &quot; ( lit . : I cli@@ cke for environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot;
&quot; his passion for the promotion of Nepal nature and wild animals , however , is not always easy . &quot;
he waited for 22 days and mostly lived in a tent to take pictures of Ot@@ tern in the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodations .
see below some of these photos below .

&quot; this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India . &quot;
a revised version was re @-@ released as part of a content sharing agreement .
&quot; in many parts of India , women are avoiding women with the greatest care to pronoun@@ ce the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family . &quot;
instead they use a pron@@ ou@@ n or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that they respect the husband because of social pressure , as well as fear of the consequences they should neglect the norm , this practice in life . &quot;
&quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto from the indi@@ an state of O@@ dish@@ a was convic@@ ted by a mock court and rejected by her family and the village community after she had addressed a married relative with his name . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of nam@@ ing their wives also is common among men . however , they have much less fear to fear , if at all , they should not follow this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel , house@@ wives , a unique club , became the main topic of the city . &quot;
it is a place only for them alone where they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
&quot; as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , he is part of the # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al campaign , operated by the community of Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and campaig@@ ning for the disman@@ tling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ist has been working with her video camera for seven years with the help of her video camera to detect practices such as children &apos;s marriage , to the exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected persons , and leads this club . &quot;
she reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them am@@ bass@@ adors of change .
&quot; the first video , which Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion , acted by women who did not call their hus@@ bands by name . &quot;
she decided on this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which women could easily identify themselves .
&quot; to pronoun@@ ce the name of their hus@@ bands lou@@ dly , is a custom that they all maintain and never questioned . &quot;
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not consider this is considered dec@@ eit@@ ful as a woman without mor@@ als .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion .
&quot; at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband by name , wanted to try out at home as it works . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was over .
&quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him from now on by his name . &quot;
&quot; with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini started their first discussion club . &quot;
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected . &quot;
at the beginning of the round Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
&quot; after the video projection , the women tried to get the discussion going with an exercise . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she asked them , &quot; &quot; If we can &apos;t say the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us as they want , that means they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day in which they had the name of their hus@@ bands on their lips , &quot; &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was of the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra over the breaking of an age @-@ old tradition in which married women could never pronoun@@ ce the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
Roh@@ ini tells :
&quot; a woman was so shy that during the whole exercise , she was only getting sick of it ; another decided to release the whole frustr@@ ated fru@@ stration against him and his family by cursed him . &quot;
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I &apos;ll never forget it again .
&quot; still in adren@@ aline rush about having broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that they would actually try to name their hus@@ bands at home . &quot;
and they kept their word .
&quot; in the coming days , Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports . &quot;
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put in her head : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she was afraid and said that it was a mistake . &quot;
another woman said : &quot; Roh@@ ini thought I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in force .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot on the forehead , showing the Eh@@ est@@ atus : &quot;
why only women have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would wear the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red point if he did it too .
he laugh@@ ed only and I stopped wearing it .
&quot; the other women have not completely stopped , but think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange opinions and goals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we make an excursion at every discussion club . &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear what , &quot; she says . &quot;
in the last months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their lives ; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things , for example how our identi@@ ties are linked to our hus@@ bands . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to be able to say certain things , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
&quot; in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with the clothing . &quot;
some women in the group have only worn sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; for most of them that &apos;s okay , but some wanted to wear a Sal@@ em @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a trousers , they didn &apos;t dare . &quot;
&quot; after much controversy and discussion about the advantages of their own dress code , mor@@ als connected with the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini smu@@ g@@ gled their own pair of cur@@ es ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) into a discussion round so that women could wear them . &quot;
&quot; next they have decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini are sure they will manage it . &quot;
&quot; to the question , whether in the five months since her first discussion club has changed something , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are moving slowly : &quot;
we have only done small steps so far .
&quot; some women tried it a few times , but then stopped saying the name of their husband . &quot;
&quot; some , including me , do it yet , but only when they are alone and there are no other family members . &quot;
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red at any time on their foreh@@ e@@ ads .
women in Dis@@ cussion Club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the hag@@ gling for more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothes - lie at the end of a difficult @-@ to @-@ navigate river .
giving each other self @-@ confidence is aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a sacrifice of patri@@ archy .
I am it too .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home and tells other people what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we are all in the same boat .

the first Japan visit to the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a commemor@@ ative day
the Beat@@ les at their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot of the official YouTube channel of the Beat@@ les .
&quot; on June 29th of this year , the &quot; &quot; H@@ ash@@ tag &quot; &quot; was to be found in the Japanese Twitter trend , where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les . &quot;
the visit to the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is considered a revers@@ al in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
&quot; the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ i@@ ko , who inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les in 1964 in London , re@@ marked in 2016 on the occasion of the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit : &quot;
&quot; for just under five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through . &quot;
the people here quickly became clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many well @-@ known Japanese sizes reached their zen@@ ith when Beat@@ les arrived in Japan for the first time in 1966 .
&quot; the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; said Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , President of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review . &quot;
&quot; good morning ! today is the Beat@@ les Memorial Day in Japan . for the first time in 51 years , they were here in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; even today , songs from the Beat@@ les are sung in Japanese kar@@ a@@ oke bars and in English classes at Japanese secondary schools . &quot;
the Beat@@ les &apos; kit@@ sch survi@@ ves everything .
today is the Beat@@ les Memorial Day .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; Win@@ nie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll is supposed to represent John L@@ enn@@ on or not .
&quot; and as it is for fans , Japanese naturally also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the well @-@ known places associated with the band . &quot;
&quot; when you love the Beat@@ les , this is your 5 places you absolutely must visit &quot;
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fiel@@ ds ( memorial in New York )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
&quot; 5 ) ( From the link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool &quot;
the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges sometimes cannot be bizarre enough :
good morning together .
today is the Beat@@ les Memorial Day .
&quot; exactly today in 1966 , the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time . &quot;
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran across Abbey Road .
we did the same last year .
&quot; and of course some companies also take advantage of the fans in the market , such as this R@@ amen @-@ Shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! &quot;
and what could that be for a day ?
I will listen to Y@@ ester@@ day today and eat R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya .
this is how the day is going to run .
&quot; so , we hope you are there ! &quot;

cross @-@ headed men are dra@@ gged and killed in Mozambique
Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia &apos;s police warned the population that people of poor people could be in Mozambique &apos;s target of attacks .
&quot; photo : different Bol@@ in / Fli@@ ck@@ r , CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 &quot;
&quot; a new system of kidn@@ apping of people for organ traffi@@ cking , probably for dis@@ belief purposes , worried the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called for a series of operations to stop the practice . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi . &quot;
one of the victims was found be@@ headed and part of the organs had been taken out .
two men were arrested and subsequently led to the use of the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi .
&quot; there are local super@@ sti@@ tions that the head of a man @-@ headed man can enth@@ use gold or bring wealth , said the police spokesman of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia of the BBC . &quot;
it is the first time that successive attacks on people of bald men were registered in Mozambique .
&quot; another group , the goal of assass@@ inations for obsc@@ ure purposes , is people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; this led to the fact that , in the South African country , the UN established a mission to investigate this practice . &quot;
&quot; the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight this super@@ sti@@ tion and prejudi@@ ces . &quot;
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who plan to travel to the country :
&quot; attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Mozambique are the target of ritual attacks , the Muslim police warned about the latest kill@@ ings of three people from three people due to their body parts . &quot;
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange where the kill@@ ings took place .
&quot; Hus@@ sen@@ e Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Mozambique , said the local police are already following the case : &quot;
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of man @-@ headed men .
&quot; the persecution and murder of single @-@ headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ ma@@ a , Province of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , has given cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans ( PR@@ M ) , which also indicates that a faith exists , according to which the sacrifices in the head might have power that will generate riches . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country . &quot;
Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha distributed on Facebook the Chron@@ icle of the blo@@ gger poor S@@ nai@@ ppa explaining that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mos@@ ambique :
&quot; to offer sex against good marks , work and other achievements , a nation in which people would be ashamed to take sex against good marks , work and other achievements , a nation in which the people would not hurt or even take their lives to earn their bread , a country in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or bald men would be hun@@ ted for indul@@ gent purposes or &quot; black magic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some could not miss the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ ren humor . &quot;
&quot; Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic Twitter user , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the head of the district of Mor@@ rum@@ ma@@ a , Pedro S@@ ange , and also the police spokesperson Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , are both gl@@ atz@@ kö@@ ping : &quot;
Muslim authorities are very concerned about the murdered people .

&quot; free Bass@@ el : citizen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New reactions from the international community for medical treatment of Nobel Prize lau@@ re@@ ates and dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o &quot;
&quot; a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably made recently . &quot;
&quot; this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 on Hong Kong Free Press . &quot;
the following version is published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the fall of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he had been hospit@@ alized for liver cancer at the final stage .
&quot; in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to 11 years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( State Haz@@ ards ) , having participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that demands democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China described Li@@ us case as an &quot; &quot; internal matter &quot; &quot; and a spokesman told he did not consider it as &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , China continues to release calls from the international community , Nobel Prize lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , or to allow him a treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ ped out . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has sum@@ mar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
united nations
&quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; a spokesman , however , refused to comment on whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure in order to allow li@@ u abroad to be treated . &quot;
Norway and Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ enden have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway came to a halt after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
&quot; diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed only in December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to resume the trip to China , as exports have been largely blocked since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his prize . &quot;
&quot; during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair . &quot;
European Union
&quot; on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a decision to remove Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants . &quot;
&quot; the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for the release of Li@@ us as announced in an explanation on 30 June : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect China to abol@@ ish all limitations of Mr. Li@@ us &apos;s wife as well as family members . &quot;
&quot; they should meet and receive all the visits they wish , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot;
United States of America
&quot; us Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told the Americans that he had the possibility of treatment abroad , in so far as he could help him with his recovery . &quot;
&quot; announ@@ cing the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , the news agency AF@@ P announced on 27 June that the embassy asked the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u , but also to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the US Embassy &apos;s request drew a fur@@ ious answer from China , with the Foreign Ministry &apos;s statement that &quot; &quot; no country has the right to interfere and ir@@ responsible remarks about Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley announced that China should offer the couple the following :
&quot; protection and freedom , such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his choice , to which they are entitled according to the Chinese Constitution and legal system as well as international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the US Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz also adopted a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; I urge China to release the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condition@@ ally , so that he can embar@@ k on a proper medical treatment . ht@@ t@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o &quot;
Germany - Germany
&quot; German government spokesman Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin hope that Li@@ u &quot; receives all the medical support he needs &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot;
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping appeared on the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg on 7 and 8 July .
&quot; previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing the Reu@@ ters news agency that China had great concerns about whether the fuss about Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg . &quot;
Canada and Canada
&quot; on 28 June , the Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um urged China to provide appropriate medical care and give him the opportunity to be cared for by his family . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ u &apos;s lawyer told AF@@ P that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that it is not permitted to speak and contact with someone outside , including his lawyers . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues to tell :
&quot; Canada demands China to uph@@ old its international human rights commitments , including freedom of expression , and to release those locked for the exercise of these rights . &quot;
France - France
France &apos;s Foreign Ministry urged China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons in an Declaration on 29 June :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs regardless of where he needs . furthermore his wife and family should have contact with him .
&quot; although the news channel France Info has already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the State Department announced that there is no further information coming out whether France will ultimately receive it . &quot;
Taiwan and Taiwan
the Council of mainland Affairs in Taiwan urged China to release Li@@ u on 27 June and to show greater tolerance to those who use peaceful means to demand political reform and democratic development .
&quot; the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legislature , Yu Me@@ i @-@ n@@ u , of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party , also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan . &quot;
Dalai Lama
&quot; the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned in an explanation on 28 June around Li@@ u and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ us well being . &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for whom he had been severely punished , led to a more harmonious , stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I felt personally moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , who signed charter 08 which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem sil@@ ly as Singapore is recognized as an independent state at an international level .
&quot; but according to the Minister of Justice , K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be regarded as a city . &quot;
this remark triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
&quot; during a meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association , the Minister noted that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of Singapore &apos;s only political party because they compared Singapore to other countries . &quot;
he supports that Singapore should be regarded as a city .
... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy ...
this is what most people commit a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; twist the logic &quot; in order to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore .
&quot; and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this valuable country , we can say that we are not a country in the end . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you &apos;re not my country , whose land is it then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons given by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very noble : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of it , he inevitably appeared un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently guided by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; as soon as one reaches the central point of the topic , the good old ly@@ re appears again from the author@@ itarian rulers who pre@@ tend to be democr@@ ats , leaving the twisted logic , because it fits better to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the end the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam was given answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system , really non @-@ rep@@ lies . &quot;
he tar@@ n@@ ished the relevant questions with non @-@ answers in a rational way .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls on Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion .
personally I find it a bit difficult to swallow .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country belongs our city ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I don &apos;t understand anything . &quot;
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the effort to clarify this point if he was paid high to be part of the Government of the City of Singapore .
&quot; by publishing his commentary on the blog , he points out to the critics that one should start reading the entire tran@@ script of the conference to better understand the context of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &apos;s statements , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country . &quot;
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he explained why the Singapore elections are so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy free and just elections . &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities have seen a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; when he said that Singapore was not a country , he obviously did not mean it in this sense ! &quot;
&quot; Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , a leader of a growing generation , which makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement . &quot;
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said ...
&quot; at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard what I expected - I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes it correctly and is aware of what he is defending . &quot;
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review pieces the vulner@@ abilities of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &quot; &quot; faith@@ fully commit a mistake &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian writer ? &quot;
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we will only be seen as an independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , on which country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back ? &quot;
Singapore is unique and it is equally land and city .
&quot; since he plays an important role within the government cabinet , Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &apos;s statements are of serious importance . &quot;
&quot; why do the people of Singapore do their military service , but do they not defend their city ? &quot;
who has to pay back our Prime Minister bills ?
what is the value of our pink personnel ID ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; journey of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore is , and has always been a city : &quot;
I did not say what I said ...
this sentence seems to have anno@@ yed many people of Singapore ...
no one ever said Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; the defense of the country , above all , &quot; etc . &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .
the My@@ th of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices recently asked his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or homeland ?
&quot; their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series , revealing rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world and to be shown another fac@@ et . &quot;
&quot; the newest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
&quot; the question that is most asked of me in Japan is , &quot; Are you Americans ? &quot; &quot;
&quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; I answer . &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; since 1994 , I have been living in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on the situation the conversation is taking place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his conversation partner by placing personal questions . &quot;
&quot; my clari@@ fication is usually followed by the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , Ice Ho@@ ckey , Nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans may boil in@@ war@@ dly when they are held for Americans , but that doesn &apos;t bother me . &quot;
&quot; for someone who does not know himself , there is little difference between Canadi@@ ans . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans carry a Canadian flag clearly visible on their ru@@ cksack when they travel .
all love Canadi@@ ans .
&quot; Americans , on the other hand , ... . &quot;
&quot; so it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 . &quot;
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care system !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; obviously , we often say &quot; sorry . &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most tolerant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate this .
&quot; first of all , I have many American friends I admire very much . &quot;
&quot; it wouldn &apos;t matter to me , for example , if I would switch to Johnny from Dallas for example . &quot;
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
&quot; first : being called &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; means to be idle , like the ben@@ evol@@ ent , gentle but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; &quot; Simp@@ sons &quot; &quot; ( who has their own Canadian Doppel@@ gänger ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada is really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , that would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing at which one can rep@@ el . &quot;
being harmless means to be in@@ conspic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and not to earn any attention .
&quot; this can be something good , if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far from the things that happen around you . &quot;
&quot; I would even go far to say that the desire to be free and alone , is a main characteristic of Canadi@@ ans . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps simply cool courtesy .
Canadi@@ ans often talk about the fence across the fence .
&quot; we lack the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends . &quot;
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) J@@ ustin Tru@@ deau entered the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada almost sexy .
music video of a pop band par@@ o@@ dies Thailand &apos;s Jun@@ ta
&quot; a pop band famous in Thailand has released a music video that par@@ o@@ dies the Jun@@ ta , which took power in 2014 , and in spite of its promise to restore the civilian government , the country continues to rule . &quot;
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ des Girl ) of the Tat@@ too Colour band describes a young man who tells the rules of his girlfriend .
&quot; although not explicitly political , the music video refers indirectly to the continued military rule of the jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video for the song was a huge success .
&quot; only within the first three days , the video uploaded to Facebook was 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists told the public to watch this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially how it beha@@ ves with the situation of the country under the jun@@ ta rule . &quot;
&quot; take a look at these videos of the video , which refer to some of the political topics that Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued over the past three years . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the provisional constitution , which gives absolute power to the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army on important national issues . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program to &quot; change the settings &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other persons who are viewed by the Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot;
&quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activ@@ ist and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a new unit was established in the army that monitors online content and prosec@@ uted persons accused of having slan@@ dered the monarchy . &quot;
Thailand uses a strict ple@@ dge against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ ority insul@@ ts ) .
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , martial law was proclaimed in Thailand . &quot;
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
&quot; one of the problems that the jun@@ ta continues to pursue is to buy expensive U @-@ boats , even though security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money . &quot;
&quot; in the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black van , before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are in prison , because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long sentences , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile the te@@ aser of the songs showed members of the band , who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Tri@@ bute from Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by Put@@ sch opponents during the protests in 2014 . &quot;
life goes on in the ruins of the ghost towns in eastern Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia

&quot; the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ war society slowly re@@ covers in East Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; now over 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ sic war has officially ended , but its s@@ cars are still strongly visible in this part of the Republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
&quot; villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ i are located in the hydro@@ carb@@ ons of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Ne@@ ar @-@ Asia , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in Soviet times in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
&quot; today , most of the Russians live in the area . &quot;
such settlements are also called ghost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the district amounted to 16@@ ,000 people after barely increased over a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 , about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district . &quot;

&quot; all this is a result of the war &quot;
&quot; the empty five @-@ storey building blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , which are called Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ tsch@@ uk@@ ow@@ kas , stand for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are deca@@ yed and very rare they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native old man .
he starts a conversation and it is hard for him to finish this .
&quot; all this is a result of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it is un@@ ambig@@ uous . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens , all of which served the community . &quot;
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded magni@@ fic@@ ence buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planned economy of the Soviet Union have left the district .
in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha approximately fifty inhabitants live .
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ chen@@ v@@ kas , which still have one or two families , can be seen on the balconies , where laundry is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me with the camera in her hand , they immediately withdraw . &quot;
&quot; our mother has forbidden us to take pictures , &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; it simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
&quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ sistence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for personal needs ) , such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation . &quot;
it &apos;s difficult to get over the laps .
&quot; in winter , the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages . &quot;

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ get@@ tes &quot;
about ten years ago an older woman named Gal@@ ina ( or a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a as she is called in the neighborhood ) moved from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; despite her oldest daughter living in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; my heart will forever remain in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , &quot; she says . &quot;
Gal@@ ina does not want to receive financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sts that instead she supports her young grand@@ children .
Gal@@ ina &apos;s monthly pension is just nine dollars .
&quot; if you don &apos;t have a vegetable garden or house , it is very hard to survive , &quot; she says . &quot;
a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a tells that she and other villa@@ gers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 year old woman and a young family and I live in this building .
&quot; when holidays are , we visit . &quot;
but we can &apos;t do this all the time - everybody is busy with his own problems . &quot;
&quot; as she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; calls a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a to her . &quot; they said we could build cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot;
I have already prepared the ground .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ a &apos;s conversation partner Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she reminds herself of the village life before the war .
&quot; despite the relatives living in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia simply broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave . &quot;

&quot; we recently bought land in Suk@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia ) .
&quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take some time , &quot; she explains . &quot;
Nat@@ ascha holds about $ 9 children &apos;s money for each child .
her husband works in the coal mine .
the young family has their own farm .
&quot; near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chickens . &quot;
she tells us that at first there was a very frigh@@ tening situation when many people left the village after the war .
but over time she lost her anxiety .

&quot; &quot; &quot; we have no fear of the dark street or the few people . &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; in fact , it has rather something to do with lo@@ oting . &quot;
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right for them .
I remember every day of how the city and the war were once .
&quot; when our conversation turns to the end , a little boy conf@@ esses to us . &quot;
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball .
&quot; as they walk , some of them throw stones onto the fallen buildings . &quot;
these ruins are part of their childhood which will cause in@@ security in their lives .
they don &apos;t know it differently .

&quot; in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; houses migrants on their long journey &quot;
&quot; Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala . &quot;
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org on 19 April 2017 and appears here with friendly permission .
&quot; on the path of migrants entering Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula . it is located on the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
&quot; it is managed by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink glasses base and gold coloured earrings in ted@@ dy bear form . &quot;
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there .
this nick@@ name is owed to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm whatsoever .
&quot; for about $ 2.@@ 50 the night sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants arrive here .
&quot; sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells the people come in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they start crying : &quot; &quot; mother Africa ! &quot;
where are you M@@ om Africa ? .
&quot; at present , it is rather quiet , but this year , Ram@@ í@@ rez has received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept outside on cardboard boxes . &quot;
she doesn &apos;t want to reject anybody .
&quot; she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , she bu@@ ys them drugs that they cannot pay , they massage them with a bal@@ m that exhausted from the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ ch@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived recently . &quot;
I asked him if M@@ om Africa was an appropriate nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Sebasti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ call@@ i who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ ts ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot;
very loving .
she has the cor@@ di@@ ality of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
&quot; you have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard from other companions of M@@ om Africa . &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he tells us that Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel along the route and that Afri@@ cans are already talking about Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez &apos;s W@@ hat@@ s@@ app .
&quot; like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a construction worker on building sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he began his journey to the United States . &quot;
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months . he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he will be in touch with Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our Mother and we never leave her again , &quot; &quot; he answered with a smile . &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells her guests send her often text messages when they are gone to greet her or tell her about the course of her journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
&quot; she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
at the other end of the city leads a dead end to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have taken migrants in their small house .
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are sold too expensive .
&quot; he has begun to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tians . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on blankets on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing . &quot;
I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people can help and others don &apos;t help . that &apos;s why I give them my support .
&quot; after he lived for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula are from central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them . &quot;
José Antonio Cor@@ do@@ va Mel@@ é@@ n@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to get money from him without having a plan .
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for accommodation and an unknown person , a single person , offered him their roof . &quot;
&quot; a few months later , the family still lives there and tries to decide where to go the next steps . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests .
&quot; in the courses , the travelers calm@@ ly consult their tel@@ eph@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; a mini@@ bus arrived today and brought 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who went away . &quot;
&quot; like a proud grandmother , she leaves her album with many photos . &quot;
&quot; there is one of her daughter with African hair @-@ spots , she has made a client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old . &quot;
she laughs sadly while she tells me briefly .

China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang people are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang by Twitter users
&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in the west of China , are forced to install a spy@@ ware on their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; on July 10 , the mobile users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an District of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a cell phone notification in which they installed the district government to install a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cleaning &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the message , it is said that the app prevents access to terrorist information . &quot;
&quot; however , the authorities decided to use the app for more than the fight against terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the Autonom@@ ous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ f@@ ecture because , shortly after they installed the app , they had exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group . &quot;
&quot; in announ@@ cing the police that the app would determine and track the sources and distribution paths of the terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information , &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ Books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs website describes the app as follows :
&quot; J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om . &quot;
&quot; the main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web sites , from online sc@@ ams , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online , and remotely control their own home network . &quot;
this app with min@@ ors for min@@ ors is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these features can of course be used in many ways .
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even hack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person . &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
&quot; while reporting on digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focuses on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those living in remote , afflicted ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; in order to limit disturbances and dis@@ content in the conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ orship and surveillance measures as well as routine internet shut@@ downs . &quot;
&quot; based on Twitter based media outlet &quot; Images from mainland China , &quot; the cens@@ ored news published in China presented photos of a check@@ point where polic@@ emen checked the residents in@@ discrimin@@ ately if they had installed the surveillance app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian ensure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification required people to install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced people to use devices that are meant for older people .
this is a form of captivity by the rest technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China again .
&quot; in addition , a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which the software can lift up the password requirements of a Windows operating system , and thus un@@ restricted access to the hard drive of the computer , also published images from mainland China . &quot;
&quot; after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang . &quot;
the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a response to the instructions given by the City Council to minimize the dis@@ sem@@ ination of illegal content .
&quot; all government branches , authorities and related institutions , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the cy@@ ber security office when operating their computers and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; Freedom House &apos;s latest report , an American human rights organisation , also mentioned these new monitoring methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi , the authorities published a regulation with the instruction to all residents and entrepreneurs , until 1 August , to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards &quot; at the local police . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist &quot; videos . however , this action viol@@ ates the personal rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole series of other possible off@@ ences , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;
&quot; sleep or death , part 1 : everything cries after death &quot;
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo by : Cor@@ rie B@@ ark@@ li@@ more ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
&quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; sleep or death , &quot; in which activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far from our blue , virtual world you look at you and realize that you are all alone in a place where everything van@@ ishes . &quot;
&quot; everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly identi@@ fiable , both from the inside and from the outside . &quot;
one that ren@@ ders honour to their name .
one that has struck down in a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaph@@ ors .
&quot; but when the reality re@@ covers you and you look behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and the performer - the characters turn into beings of flesh and blood , and everything cries after death . &quot;
&quot; all doubts dissolve in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even if the Earth is spinning on the axis of the Un@@ hei@@ ls . it becomes clear to you that you have been trapped between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone by stone . &quot;
&quot; they have arrested me and my father three times , but that wasn &apos;t enough for me to learn &quot; my lesson , &quot; as the chief of the security service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot;
he proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five teenagers were torn down during a peaceful protest like we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
&quot; it was enough for the city to sh@@ atter the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; scre@@ ams . &quot;
&quot; all the neighbor@@ hoods demanded , only my own . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was quiet , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even though I had no high expectations of a city that was stu@@ ffed up into the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; in the third night , things had cal@@ med down somewhat after the power supply in the neighborhood stopped functioning . &quot;
I broke the silence by shou@@ ting &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof several times .
I heard my voice disgu@@ sted by the silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to come together .
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we al@@ lied to a sum@@ p@@ tuous picture , full of my expectations . &quot;
&quot; at such a moment , you realize that you liber@@ ate the spirit from the lamp , but it simply doesn &apos;t interest you in the least . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot;
he laid up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can give you back your voice after you scre@@ wed it all the way to the office of the security service .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there as I am now .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to say : &quot; let me hear how you write &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; or you are brave enough to cry out if we are not near .
his hat@@ eful eyes were on me .
and you &apos;re really gri@@ eving what to look into my eyes and not on the ground !
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old and it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building .
&quot; perhaps it was my fool@@ ish@@ ness , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution . &quot;
&quot; I was so sure of my cause when I replied , &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t think you &apos;ve forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot;
&quot; and I think I never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me and yet I don &apos;t regret a word of what I said .
&quot; he puts it in solitary confin@@ ement and his father , along with it . &quot;
&quot; his father immediately with it . &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cursed movement lies in my nose until today .
&quot; he became a &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; , &quot; a mental torture that I was exposed for months . &quot;
I went through the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with me .
&quot; then again through the yard and into the second office , which leads through a gear to the individual cells . &quot;
I saw all the details exactly before I enter the room .
otherwise they have allocated to me a larger cell this time .
I have to share it with only one other prisoner and I am allowed to sit immediately without waiting for their permission .
&quot; after a few minutes , which felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I resor@@ ted to an old @-@ tried communication method : beating the fist against the wall . &quot;
&quot; I learned that my fellow prisoner was a &quot; &quot; first resp@@ ass &quot; . &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he finally answered me .
&quot; apparently in none of the surrounding cells lay a prominent middle @-@ aged man , who looks like me and is called &quot; &quot; the doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the perfect darkness , no prominent features can be seen on me , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all just numbers . &quot;
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot;
all answers neg@@ ate his existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the large cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would release him if I remain .
li@@ ars .
&quot; I would have liked to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive away all these crow@@ s , which fell on the fruits in the garden of my head . &quot;
&quot; from the distance , I still hear them scre@@ aming &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it must be around 10 o &apos;clock in the evening , always around this time the cries are ring@@ ing , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black is the color of corruption , until I saw the yellow light that presented us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; &quot; Don@@ ner &quot; , &quot; allu@@ ding to 13th S@@ ure of the Quran ) . &quot;
they are here to be interro@@ gated .
&quot; thus the secret was v@@ ented : to protect the state security from us and prevent us from sharing the tra@@ itor and the terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dialect - so they played their denom@@ in@@ ational black@@ mail and locked the narrow field of view of their world view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house , which is not a country here ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their clan into a hero . &quot;
&quot; I enter the interro@@ gation room and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he seems to me . &quot;
&quot; he begins a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the facial expressions that der@@ ail him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than to join this diary and protest against demonstrations that will end up soon . &quot;
I did not answer .
I am accustomed to not answering .
I can &apos;t really say exactly when insul@@ ts and pun@@ ches have become an ordinary means of communication for me after a friendly conversation .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
&quot; some voice in me said that I had to get used to punished , although I had nothing to do to deserve this punishment . &quot;
of punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to pull myself as much flesh as possible from the body .
he calls this aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; confession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe that probably comes from the clo@@ aks .
your exec@@ ution@@ er suddenly rejo@@ ices in your scre@@ ams .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him , and you cannot hold back your cry . &quot;
&quot; my cries were not enough for him , so they exchanged the tube through a cable . &quot;
&quot; at my first arrest , I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator had worked as a garbage collector before or if it belonged to the normal work equipment . &quot;
they inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables to present us the great invention of a giant cable from their point of view .
&quot; within a single hour three of them changed , while I was still in line . &quot;
&quot; I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I heard scre@@ aming . &quot;
&quot; the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling down and found no pleasure in it , which is why he was next to an electrically charged rod . &quot;
&quot; electricity flow@@ ed through my entire body , enough to supply my whole neighborhood . &quot;
my half @-@ naked body lying on the floor was the perfect conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
it must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
&quot; some hours passed , which came to me like minutes . &quot;
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot;
&quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted teen@@ ager : &quot; &quot; my Lord , my Father must be fear@@ less . &quot;
&quot; be quiet and hurry , you &apos;re going to be laid . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always released me .
where do they lead me ? !
&quot; the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ bal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance &quot;
Em@@ bal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ bal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time in@@ doors ; sometimes he shu@@ d@@ ders to his screen , sometimes to his computer , and again to his couch . &quot;
but what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
&quot; he lives on the top floor of his family house , which has been part of them since 1967 ; the year when Israel was completing his occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s family to escape from their village in Palestine , in which they lived as fel@@ ic@@ ye@@ witnesses ( about : Far@@ mer ) . &quot;
&quot; for six years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority and questioned its old @-@ established opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rape . &quot;
&quot; with his music , which often deals with topics such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also calls for the core of the entire Arab world . &quot;
&quot; at the age of 25 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not constra@@ ined by boundaries in his thinking , and he can sympath@@ ise with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he doesn &apos;t admit it openly , he swe@@ ars a special reluct@@ ance against the American foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones , has anything to do with his identity as the &quot; Palestinian wing@@ ed second generation &quot; - he calls himself even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think so because of my own circumstances , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b emphasizes . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; while he poured out Nes@@ café in two cups in water . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; during this time it is planned for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
&quot; obviously , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
&quot; basically speaking , the mu@@ gs speak lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the cas@@ ket of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose primarily of freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air , especially if you take a look at the neighbouring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan drinking water - in order not to land in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently , Jordan &apos;s Ministry of Interior has cancelled a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , for the second time . &quot;
&quot; some parliamentary groups supporting the Islamic action front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ osexual fron@@ ts@@ man Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o , contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert announcement . &quot;
&quot; the MP and former spokes@@ woman of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; had been cancelled because of the singer &apos;s sexual orientation . &quot;
&quot; many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which asks the old @-@ established legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regimes across the region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la estimated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who continue to stand up for intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement should probably not be simply shallow rhet@@ oric , but actually reflect a more and more clearly cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan , which appears clearly in H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s work . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b returned traditional sex norms to Lei@@ be by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who have mar@@ ital sex . &quot;
&quot; the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the screen . &quot;
it is surrounded by a red sea ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should actually trust .
&quot; in recent years , the number of &apos; honorary mor@@ als &apos; has increased in Jordan - the in@@ official out@@ war@@ dly . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , the number of honour mur@@ ders reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is still alar@@ ming that Jordan has failed to support the institutional infrastructure to support women who have attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way . &quot;
&quot; according to a law to fight crime in 1954 , women who are exposed to the risk of domestic violence are &quot; &quot; deta@@ ined in prison in@@ definitely &quot; , &quot; and for their release , many years of bureaucratic expendi@@ tures as well as the guarantee on the part of the family are often necessary for the woman to do nothing . &quot;
&quot; also H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s music enjoys great popularity and is known for not shy away from themes , which in his country long as t@@ abo@@ o . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he cannot separate his music , which is full of explicit allu@@ sions to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot;
&quot; politics in@@ filtr@@ ated me , &quot; he says . &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b takes up the question of Palestinian identity .
&quot; in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus again lies on poverty . &quot;
the list of songs that are political at the core can be continued .
in March 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song titled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
&quot; in this song , a verse is repeated conspic@@ u@@ ously : &quot;
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is . &quot;
&quot; in the further course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market on which one , in his words , &quot; can get what you want &quot; - either faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
he notes that hardly anyone in Jordan speaks about the rights of gay and les@@ bians and that comments on the equality of LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals were still heavily cens@@ ored by 2014 .
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ an online program Ro@@ ya , to later realize that his comments were torn , twisted and cens@@ ored in his opinion . &quot;
&quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without cuts , but was only a edited version , &quot; he says . &quot;
today H@@ da@@ i@@ b is open to the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance to homosexu@@ als does not ent@@ ail Islam .
&quot; he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ ova , a poet of the eighth century , who still remains in memory thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ eva , who later had to work on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , has nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot;
&quot; in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ic kingdom , it is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service established several former government decre@@ es and members of the teaching association , with the reason that they had critical comments in social media to the problems associated with the corruption that had been deeply rooted in the country . &quot;
&quot; in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s opinion is just the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; for him , progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has now rep@@ elled M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the way of progress - that &apos;s how it sees H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , thou@@ ghtful and internal changes . he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society . &quot;
&quot; in the end , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without any intervention abroad . &quot;
&quot; he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of experiencing &quot; it . &quot; &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region will approach a genuine and fundamental openness with the help of music , art and literature - and not by bombs , cluster muni@@ tions and arti@@ ficially induced demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least , he hopes . &quot;
&quot; as far as it is , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to tow and consequently also resist . &quot;
&quot; this report was made possible by the Pul@@ itzer Center on Cris@@ is Reporting , which A@@ man belongs to Fel@@ low . &quot;
Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan .
these big and extravag@@ ant war pupp@@ ets are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origins of the Neb@@ uta festival .
&quot; it is assumed that it is a variation of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually also celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the fe@@ ats , drums and dancing have been taken over more than a thousand years ago , in order to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi , to the knees . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a great view . &quot;
one can only imagine how large these parts are ...
&quot; a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) . &quot;
I have been looking at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two solid cars are just to be seen .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true one - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer : &quot;
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of an 18 @-@ metre @-@ high fixed car was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ vi@@ ans exchange weapons against sciss@@ ors and raz@@ ors

&quot; rarely , external appearance and body care were as important as in this story , because they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crime and to promote a legitimate profession like the hair@@ dresser &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; El Cal@@ la@@ o , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima &apos;s capital , a region with a very high crime rate where street noise and illegal drug traffi@@ cking are everyday . &quot;
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe .
&quot; at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men . &quot;
&quot; the trend , the appearance and therefore also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to getting more and more normal citizens into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these elaborate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the ultimate limits of imagination and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 . &quot;
experts face each other to show who can create the most ec@@ centric looks as you can see in the following video ( other videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
&quot; educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy , located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to get a training in hair@@ dressing instead of bad advice , which allows them to find work . &quot;
&quot; motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion . &quot;
&quot; before the school year beginning in March , the school offered special training workshops and reported on some of its achievements : &quot;
&quot; in 1995 we were the only college in the municipality and district where we are very proud , because from love to the children we have built this educational community . &quot;
Colombia : love letters to gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters
photo : Valent@@ ina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with friendly permission .
the following article is the edited version of the &quot; declaration of love to gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
is it not even more important to accommodate people who feel expelled ?
&quot; this is precisely the question of the young Colom@@ bian activ@@ ist Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga from the Bo@@ got@@ Art Foundation and Cr@@ isti@@ an Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation ( letters of reconciliation ) , encouraging young people to write letters to gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters . &quot;
&quot; only recently , her country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to this : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government signed a peace treaty with the gu@@ erri@@ lla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Ar@@ med Forces of Colombia ) , which forms the end point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; internationally , the signing of the peace treaty was so important that the Colom@@ bian President José Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; before the Colom@@ bians , however , there is still a long way until one can speak of real reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters who have lived in illegal camps for many years , exposed to war rhet@@ oric and carried their weapons round the clock must now be integrated into the lives of civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society , in turn , has become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred towards gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters , must now take them into their ranks and support them in building a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an were convinced that the young Colom@@ bians would join together and help in the integration process .
and exactly that they did : so far thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters to welcome them back to society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former gu@@ erri@@ lla fighter who is to be handed over personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as Inspiration for the Campa@@ ign
&quot; the idea for reconciliation was created at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bo@@ got@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an had the opportunity to briefly talk to K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valentine &apos;s Day on Valentine &apos;s Day , but those who need it much more urgently . &quot;
&quot; he plans to share his love with people this year , desper@@ ately needed . &quot;
&quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; up to now , more than 2,000 letters have been collected during the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bo@@ got@@ á . &quot;
I never thought someone would forgive me
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
&quot; a group of 40 students from the University Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the City Council of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bo@@ got@@ Art Foundation , travelled to the camp to personally convi@@ ct the letters . &quot;
the F@@ ARC members set themselves up as they had done before in order to accept the orders of their leaders .
&quot; but this time they received no orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it is unbelievable how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that lies between them , &quot; said Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Gover@@ nor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience : &quot;
&quot; after passing the letters , a former warri@@ or led me through the camp of the gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters live ) , I saw a gu@@ erri@@ lla fighter who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go in , because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ gar@@ net , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty . &quot;
&quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; H@@ ello , what are they doing right now ? &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone wrote to me . &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never before in my life someone wrote something like that , so I answer it . &quot; then suddenly tears ran over the che@@ eks . &quot;
&quot; I embra@@ ced him completely , and sat beside the net @-@ lights . &quot;
&quot; perhaps he was tired of the war , and was tired of being the faithful companion of this fighter for all the years , and wanted to help him write this letter . &quot;
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers from star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society outside waiting for us with open arms .
&quot; until now , I have only learned how to deal with weapons . &quot;
&quot; but now where peace reign@@ s , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new Vo@@ ices
&quot; at the start , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC have joined a discussion group . &quot;
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC had already been in hiding .
&quot; this is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC have declared the history of the organization , their ideals , and gave an insight into their views on the peace process . &quot;
&quot; the aim of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; one of them said . &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; hearing these people who had never heard hearing and had no right to vote , and recognize that the people I often saw as monsters and even hated people , who were turned up@@ side down by their circumstances and their environment , was very painful for me . &quot;
the reality in which the country lives is hur@@ ting me .
&quot; but it comforts me that all people , including those who have killed and caused so much damage , can teach us something and give us a smile and a hu@@ g . &quot;
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
&quot; Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote the following letter to Dar@@ í@@ o de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of the City of Cal@@ i : &quot;
the Colom@@ bians have been prophes@@ ied that peace would rule after dis@@ armament .
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as there is inequality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people willing to take up arms , rise up and protest for their rights . and this is also completely justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we of the F@@ ARC now rely on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; therefore we call all def@@ enders of peace - no matter which race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , for we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . &quot;
&quot; there will be many obstacles on our way , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; homosexu@@ als and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; with terror , activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
but the threat that hangs on the LG@@ BT@@ Q community over the LG@@ BT@@ Q community does not arise only overnight .
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is happening in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has captured the international head@@ lines several months ago , after reports have been published that deal with the dra@@ gging , torture and killing of que@@ ens in the Republic . &quot;
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities who arrested suspi@@ cious qu@@ eer men and put them into secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; they have brought a monster to the world &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ wife , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
&quot; since her childhood , she felt she was a woman in reality . &quot;
&quot; when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , so she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had experienced the gender equality of their land@@ lady , the hunt for Sab@@ rina was opened . &quot;
&quot; for fear of her life , she ultimately moved to the USA . &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer assistant in a human rights organisation .
one day I told me that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman who was in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he was a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it everywhere on the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . &quot;
&quot; after that , the photos from my documents through the whole W@@ hat@@ s@@ App made the round . &quot;
&quot; on 10 October 2015 , I was attacked . &quot;
&quot; when I was just about to fetch a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a man &apos;s voice saying : &quot; here &apos;s a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
&quot; when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but nothing hurt me . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; how long do you still want to dish@@ on@@ our the family , you cry ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
&quot; I only know there was a young man , not thirty years old . &quot;
then I lost consciousness and eventually woke up in the hospital .
&quot; apparently , some women had everything to get along and to scre@@ am . &quot;
the man was bra@@ i@@ ded .
the women had called for an ambul@@ ance .
&quot; in the hospital , I learned that I had two spi@@ kes in my right lung . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : in which nursing homes were you laid , in which the men or women ? &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my documents are outdated , my male name is still on it , but the doctor understood and put me to the women . &quot;
I am very thank@@ ful for that .
&quot; when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him for having dealt with me respect@@ fully .
I spent more than a month in hospital .
last February I received threats .
&quot; they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown . &quot;
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they demanded to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that all was a lie .
&quot; they set absurd demands : some said to me , I must prove it by running up@@ stairs without through the streets ; others wanted me to appear on the official television in Gros@@ ny and say that I didn &apos;t change my gender , that everything was just bad news , and Phot@@ os@@ hop . &quot;
I have grain size C - what should I say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for them .
some older people once said my mother on the street .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster to the world that has sh@@ amed not only your family , but the whole republic . &quot;
&quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
&quot; it was too much for my mother , and she laid a rope around his neck . &quot;
luckily the neighbors came and rescu@@ ed them .
&quot; at that time , I had to change the apartment several times a day . &quot;
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with dark@@ ened windows and a number plate with a 95 .
&quot; after it had happened for the third time , it became clear to me that there was a little bit lazy . &quot;
my human rights friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with their help I left the country , but then something incredible happened . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
&quot; shortly before I left Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived . &quot;
&quot; I bought her without registering , without identification , without anything . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage .
arrived and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my cell phone .
&quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother per W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I received a message : &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t believe , you &apos;re in security , just because you left the country ? &quot;
our people already know in which hotel you &apos;re stuck . you even know your room number .
only to prove it to you : it is the number 115 .
can you imagine this ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; however , we don &apos;t talk about gender equality , that &apos;s a t@@ abo@@ o topic . &quot;
I still carry some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements in me .
&quot; as much as I desire , I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier . &quot;
&quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with camera , I really bother to look at the person they remember from their past - so to my male form . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends , those who are dor@@ man@@ t ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report last week in Washington .
&quot; for this , I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I talked to someone who has sat in ar@@ gun one and a half months .
&quot; he told that during Ram@@ adan , no people were arrested and tortured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan were not able to wait , and he did not lock a new wave . &quot;
most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives .
&quot; I mean , they probably invite the relatives , these take care of the problem with the person affected and at the end demand proof that the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; honor &quot; &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction . &quot;
OC Media : are gay men still being held in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says that there are not so many .
&quot; if , then , above all , those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives to face Kad@@ y@@ rows Court . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they are held there so that they can be presented as terrorists later . &quot;
&quot; say : should they be killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim they had attacked any village or military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not simply disappeared , they were deliberately sub@@ merged in order to radi@@ cal@@ ise themselves . &quot;
OC Media : is this only a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was deta@@ ined one and a half months in ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard grew .
there was nothing new from them ever since .
they just took them along .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was even when these people were taken along . &quot;
&quot; until now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there were no reports so far . however , we suspect that such actions are possible . &quot;
why would it not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know whether these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already occurred in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
&quot; I think , before 2003 , I was already known in the whole of Gros@@ ny when I still lived there - and I never had any problems . &quot;
seriously !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when Sh@@ aria was considered , I never had any problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , back then it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia originally wanted to bring us to &quot; &quot; civil@@ isation &quot; , &quot; but eventually rejected us back to the Stone Age . &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked : I had d@@ yed eyel@@ ashes , wore tube jeans and short tops . &quot;
the Ministry of Security of Sh@@ aria never hurt me just one hair .
&quot; in front of the Russian Theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , met a whole group of people like me . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several banks were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there . &quot;
we were never offen@@ ded .
in the Ch@@ echn@@ ya language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is : &quot; sp@@ ire not on the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
it is often said to have children when they make fun of the sick .
&quot; OC Media : so they just closed their eyes to you , because they thought you were ill ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : yes .
&quot; they never insul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted and never struck . &quot;
OC Media : how long did this grace period last ?
Sab@@ rina : until Kad@@ y@@ row entered the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed prime minister in 2005 , he began to speak about morality on television . &quot;
&quot; he did not talk about us per se , but primarily about the behaviour of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , one could feel how people began to change in the city . &quot;
those who had laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed before looked at you at once with suspicion .
&quot; in time , I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel the situation in the Republic was steadily worsen@@ ing . &quot;
OC Media : what activity do you go now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US .
&quot; apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist . &quot;
at the moment I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organise te@@ ac@@ ups , gather@@ ings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them to get food cards . &quot;
I don &apos;t make a cent for it .
I discovered these people themselves when I r@@ att@@ led to the type of refuge .
I am Muslim and wants to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s sil@@ ly .
nature has nothing to do with religion .
&quot; this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens , who want to prophes@@ y with foam in front of the mouth , that there are no spo@@ ols in them . &quot;
&quot; the Da@@ gest@@ ans have those who have the cab@@ ar@@ ers , the Russians too , and on the whole planet they are - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I come from there , so it &apos;s unpleasant to hear something like that . &quot;
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us here .
many of them - practicing Muslims walking into the mos@@ que and fasting during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
&quot; you know , many think about transi@@ ll@@ ity to men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different kinds of feeling , to be exact , different life settings . &quot;
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
&quot; I &apos;m sorry that I will be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago . &quot;
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn of an increase of suicide in the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; since the past few months , there has been a strong rise of suicide . &quot;
the photograph of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August brought the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran , which is shaped by poverty and unemployment , into the lim@@ eli@@ ght . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the south @-@ west of Iran .
&quot; he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability to pay for his family , so Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous . &quot;
a video posted on YouTube held the moments after he had lit himself .
some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the flames and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the town of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources the burns were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more .
he died a short time later .
&quot; it was not the only suicide committed in August within the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi minority , and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , Sa@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im . &quot;
&quot; their stories have one thing in common : it was all family fathers who felt hel@@ pless and unable to live their families on account of the persecution on the part of the Iranian government , to feed their families and to pursue a safe work . &quot;
&quot; Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
the region in which a large part of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to make a living .
&quot; a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i monarchy assumed power and took great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population receives little from this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often the victim of untreated diseases , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime refuses the Ah@@ wa@@ zi @-@ Arabs to work systematically in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries . &quot;
&quot; the government has also built a large number of dam@@ s , the water from the Arab regions to the Persian territories , where provinces Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie . &quot;
&quot; these dam@@ s have only led to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation caused in the region , and to destroy the local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry . &quot;
the rate of unemployment among the Arab a@@ haw@@ zi @-@ young people now rose to 81 % .
&quot; Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general manager for co@@ operatives , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is who are looking for a job , completed primary school , completed 55 % of a secondary school and 45 % have university degrees . &quot;
a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian ancest@@ or human rights activ@@ ist with resi@@ dency in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of suicide among young Ah@@ wa@@ zi men . &quot;
the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process :
&quot; since function@@ aries and institutions prefer not to employ Arab workers , local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living outside their homeland of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their first and last name in order to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ wa@@ zi and thus be hired , because even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated , let alone speak the Arabic language or wearing Arabian clothes . &quot;
&quot; given the circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi have to endure , human rights activists beat the alarm before the situation becomes explosive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and taking note of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; why I do not identify myself with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ alist &quot;
detail of a photo . included by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Com@@ mons License .
the following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the website A@@ fro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
&quot; when I say that I am not a feminist , many women - especially white women who call themselves inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ alist fem@@ inists - react with fru@@ stration . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
&quot; they even put out well thought @-@ out scientific and social arguments ahead of me , why I should be a feminist and why we should be all fem@@ inists in general . &quot;
&quot; for example , women nowadays earn less money despite equal education than men . &quot;
women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women come to a glass ceiling sooner or later in various spheres of life , and that discrimination based on sex still runs across the many different countries and beliefs . &quot;
all this is aware and well @-@ known to me .
I am convinced that I am suffering twice and triple .
I am a black woman .
&quot; nevertheless : when I speak on skin color , on racism , on black women women , on black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; when I mention how we have always been ab@@ used physically , mentally and verb@@ ally , both in and outside the feminist movement , many white fem@@ inists decide to remain silent . &quot;
&quot; however , everyone agrees that women - all women - should come together to &quot; &quot; sing their voices &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord &quot; &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women . &quot;
but they do not want to talk about sexu@@ alised violence in addition to an institution@@ alised form of rac@@ ist motivated violence that we are exposed to black women in tw@@ o@@ fold manner .
&quot; or , that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and places of origin deserve less than white men and women . &quot;
&quot; that black girls and girls with a migration background are more often referred to the school than white girls , due to obvious integration problems . &quot;
&quot; or that women in black spheres and women are exposed to a higher risk with a migration background , to suffer domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men of any skin color have the same rights ; on the other hand , I cannot join as a black woman who refuses to take into account injusti@@ ces in her mind , which refers both to the sex and the skin color of a person . &quot;
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging in a white @-@ feminist sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; in 18@@ 51 , So@@ jour@@ ner compla@@ ined in her speech : &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is in a historical sense an evil and margin@@ alized being . &quot;
&quot; I refuse to join group@@ ings , which also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropri@@ ation , in order to promote their ego@@ centric program . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer try to expose white women to the importance of overl@@ apping of skin color and gender . for some of them continue to silence the importance of black women for the feminist movement , no matter how many black women attempt to teach them of a better . &quot;
&quot; although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded in order to give women of different backgrounds a home and to differentiate themselves from white femin@@ ism , there is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in its name . &quot;
&quot; I prefer to release myself fully from femin@@ ism and join the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was called to life for my dark skin and my status as a woman , so stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon . &quot;
now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres created by us for us .
&quot; Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ can@@ a wom@@ anism : we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , mental , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped that make up the black woman . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists will call immediately separ@@ atism and exclusion , after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of feminist movement , of which the black woman is affected . &quot;
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can stand up black women and women from other cultures because in this paradigm I exist .
I will be recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and my existence as a woman .
&quot; I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment where my life is neither ignored nor ignored nor rejected . &quot;
padd@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
&quot; this post by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports in@@ particular about international efforts to solve environmental problems . &quot;
&quot; as part of a content sharing agreement , this article will be re @-@ published here . &quot;
&quot; Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled again and again over the past seven years , mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a particular concern of the Kurdist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission is to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations . &quot;
in this documentary of E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community .
&quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was a child , &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot;

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; by cur@@ tail@@ ing . the article belongs to the number # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wi@@ lich@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) reported about the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the affected persons .
&quot; a police com@@ miss@@ ar said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner who was violent against her . &quot;
&quot; since the end of her relationship , some time had passed and the police said that her statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done . &quot;
&quot; when another woman showed Bal@@ bu@@ ena because of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment , A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez &apos;s ad @-@ informed ad did not help . &quot;
a few days later the second wife with@@ drew her ad .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women have a complaint at all , they generally do not receive support from the State . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse . &quot;
&quot; content 1 Stri@@ ke and Statisti@@ cs 2 In@@ visible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that does not under@@ mine Paragu@@ ay@@ an laws : good approach , inadequate implementation impacts and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to determine how many women are really ab@@ used , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a social science research institution in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; the numbers available , however , are alar@@ ming . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the District At@@ tor@@ ney General attracted 9@@ 600 ads because of domestic violence . 70 % of them were violence against women . &quot;
86 % of ads in police came from women .
&quot; there were more than 5,000 ads because of domestic violence in the courts of peace . 86 % of women &apos;s ads arrived here too . &quot;
&quot; in the advertisements , 40 % of women said that they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse . &quot;
&quot; these statistics , however , do not show the real extent of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot;
&quot; at the end of 2014 , there are two women who don &apos;t do so because of physical abuse , and there are two women who do not do so . &quot;
&quot; since women &apos;s murder in Paraguay is not a criminal off@@ ence , the prosecution authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered by their current or former partners each year . &quot;
&quot; by August 2016 , journalists counted at least 12 cases of women &apos;s suicide in the country . &quot;
the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
&quot; according to estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies due to violence by men . &quot;

un@@ seen abuse and a legal system that does not under@@ mine
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the firm girlfriend of Carlos Vera , he insisted that she named him the names of all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning she didn &apos;t want it , but she didn &apos;t give up . she should regret it forever . &quot;
&quot; today , Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos . but for two years she endu@@ red mental violence , one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult to recognize : &quot;
I never thought I would become victims of abuse .
&quot; when I read about it earlier , I always thought that only women who are too sub@@ servi@@ ent because they are deceived by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera .
&quot; without nam@@ ing a name , she wrote posts on Facebook in which she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her . &quot;
&quot; many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos themselves . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse . &quot;
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why they had fallen for so long by Carlos and did not leave him earlier .
it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least some complic@@ ity about it .
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , who did not come from Paraguay , fought for nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner was mi@@ stre@@ ating her . &quot;
&quot; Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te Cre@@ o ( &quot; &quot; I believe you &quot; &quot; ) consisting of women who are all victims of abuse in some way . &quot;
&quot; in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
&quot; in Victoria &apos;s case , everything began with psychological abuse . &quot;
her wealthy partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat her .
&quot; Victoria &apos;s advertisements with the authorities remained without result and also from their relatives , she received no support . &quot;
&quot; she carried out a trial against her former partner , who developed into an un@@ predictable legal fight between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner . &quot;
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach and inadequate implementation
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good , but not applied . &quot;
&quot; the display of abuse is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees major problems in applying the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ el@@ as ( # für@@ st ) . &quot;
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ U@@ na@@ Men@@ os ( # Non@@ en@@ e@@ Wen@@ iger ) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original draft of the law fores@@ ees to declare Fem@@ izi@@ d into an independent crime and punish it harder as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; in this way , the law text has been modified in a number of ways in order to also acquire the de@@ pu@@ ties of the law that are being denied the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions , which are currently prohibited in Paraguay and punished with up to five years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the original draft bill envis@@ aged the majority of ( bureaucratic and economic ) procedures , which must bear the victims of violence at present , if they just want to refund , and would like to receive a safe accommodation to the state . &quot;
&quot; Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective , if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it : &quot;
in Paraguay mis@@ use is seen as part of inter @-@ human relationships .
&quot; here , a re@@ thinking must take place so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal . &quot;
&quot; who is silent in the face of these facts , complic@@ ates himself and contributes to the offen@@ se that the perpetr@@ ators are offen@@ ded . &quot;
we have to refund as long as abuse is no longer considered normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . however , parts of the law had been changed , among other things , a passage which the partners in cases called for reconciliation of domestic violence . &quot;
the opinions about the changes go apart .
the section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
&quot; the submission of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law , however , is considered a great set@@ back . &quot;

independent media continue to attack attacks a year after the ban of a newspaper
&quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked due to a resolution of the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; on the homepage of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; more than a year ago , the Indian authorities closed the independent Arab language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their reporting on corruption in the sul@@ t@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison , where he served an annual prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Za@@ her Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and brought to trial . &quot;
&quot; Oman has been governed by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , having settled his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; é@@ tat . &quot;
&quot; in addition to his role as the only sul@@ tan , he has since then held the most important positions in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Minister of Finance , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the Sultan &apos;s regime is marked by the insi@@ di@@ ous efforts of security forces , especially domestic intelligence , civil liber@@ ties , including freedom of press , restric@@ ting and torture human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists . &quot;
&quot; the authorities systematically restrict peace and legitimate activities in the field of human rights and prevent citizens , including activists , to freely express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and the imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country . &quot;
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper which has been reported since its inc@@ eption in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
&quot; on July 28 , 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Editor @-@ in @-@ Chief of Az@@ am@@ n , arrested , after the newspaper published an article entitled &quot; High @-@ ranking parties to the hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary &quot; on July 26 , 2016 . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials were accused of having put pressure on judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to susp@@ end an inheritance dispute . &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Za@@ her Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a member of the board of editorial board , was invited from ISS to the Special Section and arrested by the security forces upon his arrival . &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2016 , the ISS recorded the deputy editor @-@ in @-@ chief You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief after al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is . &quot;
&quot; the paper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information gave the order that &quot; &quot; the publication and distribution of the paper on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 prohibited . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i took place in Mas@@ kat &apos;s trial . &quot;
the court sentenced the three journalists to prison terms and also ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j both were convic@@ ted of distur@@ b@@ ance of the public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the prestige of the state . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition , Al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of a ban on publication and the slan@@ der . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es amoun@@ ting to 3000 US dollars each ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of using &quot; an information network for the distribution of material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
&quot; al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was arrested on 22 August 2016 , and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the Appe@@ als Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i at a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but Al @-@ Ha@@ j sentenced him to six months in prison for a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 following the arrest of his six @-@ month prison sentence in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j remains in prison where he served his annual prison sentence .
&quot; the Appe@@ als Court also raised the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; newspaper . &quot;
&quot; despite the decision of the Court to release Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper continues to see attacks by the U.S. government . &quot;
&quot; on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and with which the minister presented himself once again against the decision of the Appe@@ als Court to allow the publication of the paper again . &quot;
the perpet@@ ual closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which Oman has recently viol@@ ated the freedom of the press .
&quot; other injuries include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of print on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease its operation . &quot;
&quot; due to the continuing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the imprisonment of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the Japanese authorities are still un@@ willing to put an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press . &quot;
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the Indian authorities to :
1 . You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j promptly and un@@ condition@@ ally release ;
2. create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n in order for their journalists to pursue their work ;
&quot; 3 . to protect the freedom of the press in the country , and &quot;
&quot; 4 . in all circumstances , ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman have un@@ hin@@ dered their ri@@ ghtful human rights work and can exercise without fear of ret@@ ali@@ ation measures , including judicial exec@@ utions . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and neighbouring countries through the promotion of freedom of expression and association , as well as the right to gather peac@@ efully , support them and provide them with protection . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , illustration takes place with his consent &quot;
medical research in Africa is seldom or not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on site : there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent .
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and malaria have far more serious effects in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment for the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem . &quot;
&quot; secondly , research carried out by African scientists is helping to build up its own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of Central Laboratory at the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia in the 1990s , especially when the AIDS epide@@ mic showed serious effects on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for studying in the United States , first in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as a post @-@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he found himself on the HIV virus , before he decided to go back home to support the Serbian health system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understanding of the media about this research . &quot;
( disc@@ la@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results .
&quot; in addition , I am currently starting a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant pathogens . &quot;
GM : what do you think is the most important scientific topics in your country and in Africa in general ?
how do they differ from those in western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; this must change , otherwise we will always remain bene@@ fici@@ aries instead of being M@@ acher . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get are often not suitable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here . &quot;
GV : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported in different ways .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or go here , because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot;
GV : how is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work that you didn &apos;t have before ?
&quot; RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money , a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
GM : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is already an interest but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; GV : how big is your opinion according to the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on , and how can we support development ? &quot;
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there is need for special academic education , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer science , big data , research into space , health care ( non @-@ communic@@ able and con@@ ta@@ gious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly . &quot;
&quot; GV : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa compared to Western countries , based on your experience ? &quot;
&quot; RW : often it is the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that challenges here . &quot;
&quot; the system , that magazines can only make articles accessible against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; ) , also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers change world food production
&quot; this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website of En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide . &quot;
Frank Mor@@ ton has been breeding salad since the 1980s .
&quot; its company offers 114 varieties such as Out@@ red@@ dish , the first plant grown and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space . &quot;
&quot; for almost 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was limited only by his own resour@@ c@@ efulness and the question of how many types of let@@ tu@@ ce he can get . &quot;
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them for breeding .
&quot; the patents bear not only for individual varieties , but also for certain properties , such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green ton or cri@@ mp@@ ed leaves . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cer@@ eal or cart@@ el types . due to this trend , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts provide food security to the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mor@@ ton still breeds let@@ tu@@ ce , but he needs longer since his work is more and more difficult . &quot;
&quot; it is as if a b@@ oul@@ der is lying in a river , around which I have to p@@ addle . &quot;
&quot; we have to do that now , but it is a break with the tradition of breeding , &quot; he says . &quot; I think that these patents go too far . &quot;
&quot; and if they stand before judgment , no one can breed a new variety because all features are already patented . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , he is very careful and tries to use no material protected as intellectual property . &quot;
he has also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the US and everywhere in the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Rö@@ mer@@ sal at the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station . there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds more like the movement from the IT sector and not from the area of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for open @-@ source seeds ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software that provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software .
it was launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and thus can be used permanently for plant breeders .
&quot; as part of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , U.S. breeders may ob@@ lige others to freely use the seed bred by them . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; breeders merely allow others who buy their seed , breed it in order to breed their own varieties , and not to cut it out immediately - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents . &quot;
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy outlook
&quot; for the professor at the University of Wis@@ con@@ sin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control over seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants is important for food security and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; according to him , seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance . &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the open @-@ source movement is not concerned with genetically modified plants .
&quot; all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not . &quot; &quot; to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over seeds , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; those who want to buy good , locally and sustain@@ ably produced vegetables , such as farmers markets , should also know that the way this vegetables is grown is threatened . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without a seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to continuing to share their seeds freely , as opposed to patented seed and plant characteristics . &quot;
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
&quot; O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered because of the increasing intellectual property rights available on plant material , which is therefore always limited , shr@@ inking continuously . &quot;
&quot; Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of O@@ ss@@ i , has worked in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about one third of all cart@@ el characteristics are protected as intellectual property , making it suitable for plant breeders either at all or only difficult . &quot;
&quot; for other plants , such estimates do not exist yet , but experts like Lu@@ by suggest that mass @-@ grown plants such as wheat are patented as salad or car@@ rots . &quot;
a question of the perspective
&quot; plants are bred so that they have pur@@ pos@@ efully desired traits - from those by which their taste or colour is improved to such , because of which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
&quot; opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for gro@@ wers has more and more patents . at present , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever before , as the changing conditions are much worse by climate change . &quot;
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to spokesperson C@@ arly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to acknowled@@ ges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . &quot;
&quot; it contradic@@ ts , however , that intellectual property developers implement other breeders , as &quot; patents and protection of plant vari@@ etal devices promote innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent expi@@ red . &quot;
often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method .
&quot; such protection does not prevent innovation , but encourages them by making more material and know @-@ how available to the public . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ ton sees that for another 20 years , until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly does not promote innovation . &quot;
&quot; if you have to wait so long for breeding plants that have been adapted to the changing environmental conditions , you would have lost the battle . &quot;
&quot; the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources have always been a com@@ mon@@ place and should continue to remain : &quot; &quot; independent plant breeders do not have time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us . &quot;
we want farmers to make their work easier .
this is what drives us and it is impossible for us to continue to use the best and newest genetic resources .
&quot; overall , Mor@@ ton is bot@@ her@@ ing on the concept of patented plant features : &quot; we do not really create the features ourselves . &quot;
the plants form it themselves and as a bree@@ der we have no idea how the plants do this .
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ p , plant bree@@ der in the U.S. state of Oreg@@ on and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; whoever breeds a variety , also breeds his own values into it . &quot;
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures are required for their cultivation of mass her@@ bi@@ cides which breed in its varieties this concept of agriculture .
my concept is exactly opposite . &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized companies ( those that move on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to ) patents possess , most of the smaller seed companies can survive without patents - either they reject the patent or they consider it too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both are the case . &quot;
the independent plant bree@@ der Frank Mor@@ ton searches for Sal@@ ate in his breeding garden .
photo by Karen Mor@@ ton .
&quot; Mor@@ ton also believes that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents : &quot; &quot; it looks like I &apos;m working with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patent . &quot;
&quot; I need constantly new material for my catalog , since I know that my competitors will sell my grades in a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent , you are protected from competition for 20 years , with which I think it is pretty simple . &quot; &quot;
&quot; although the USA seems to be a leader in open source breeding , the concept soon spreads around the world . &quot;
&quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , is a &quot; open source &quot; seed program . in order to preserve the seed of traditional vegetable varieties , the Centre is working together with farmers and helps them grow new varieties that meet certain requirements . &quot;
it also supports them to come to open source seeds and sell their own .
&quot; the German organization Agre@@ co@@ l works on an open @-@ source licence , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ ss@@ i obligation for breeders in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ( rules for breeding differ from country to country , therefore the O@@ ss@@ i obligation cannot simply be adopted one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . &quot;
&quot; however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the global trend towards the pat@@ enting of seeds . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for open source seed systems explains that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for open source seed systems for which the official start of the year will be expected next year . &quot;
&quot; a consortium of environmental protection and development groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on erosion , technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion , technology and concentration ) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food - has published a report from relief organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation , and others . &quot;
&quot; the report also stresses the importance of a diverse , local supply of seed for sustainable food systems - a connection that Lu@@ by von O@@ ss@@ i hopes to see more people soon . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has largely paid attention to where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their food . &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of cens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still lock contents on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
&quot; on the weekend of 05.@@ August , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported above them . &quot;
&quot; in August , the Network posted a statement on Facebook in which the Egyptian authorities critici@@ zed this step sharply and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; despite this attack and the der@@ mo@@ cking of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities , which should defend the law , it was never as important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I confirms that all the technical possibilities are exhausted to overcome the blocking and not to yield . we insist on fulfilling our task . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Qatar @-@ based network of Al Jaz@@ e@@ era due to alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot; &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the wave of website barriers to the victim . @ an@@ hr@@ i is one of the main data sources for human rights in the Arab language ht@@ t@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
&quot; in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spread of columns and articles , which he writes for in Egypt not accessible websites and media . &quot;
&quot; now the blog , which he directed to b@@ ypass the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government , was even the target of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blo@@ gger , the provider with which also Zi@@ eli@@ blog is native , on the other hand , is further accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video how police exercised physical violence against two students . &quot;
his articles revol@@ ve around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada commented on the blocking by the government and reflected what this means for him : &quot;
&quot; to lock blo@@ gs is very old , but has priority in the Er@@ del@@ f@@ atta@@ h al @-@ S@@ isi era ; and even if the blo@@ gs of blo@@ gs may not be significant for the world , it is for me for two reasons : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) They managed to give me the feeling of a siege state ; an arrest , an attempted murder , un@@ loading the national Security Council , the blocking blo@@ gs and any other web site I worked for . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) You have proven that I did not write for nothing . in other words , my words have influence , albeit only to a small audience . &quot;
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to post items to b@@ ypass the cens@@ orship .
&quot; now however , after blocking it and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the brave go the way to the end .
&quot; according to the Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) , Egyptian authorities blocked their websites from 24 May to 0@@ 6th August . this resulted in technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and E@@ ti@@ sal@@ at . &quot;
&quot; also , af@@ te documented the blocking of providers that was possible by b@@ yp@@ assing Internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s ) &quot;
af@@ te reported in her research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of websites that V@@ P@@ N@@ s offer began . &quot;
such a practice indicates the government &apos;s intention to continue blocking and filtering content that Egyptian users might have access to .
&quot; in addition , the situation is ag@@ grav@@ ated by the fact that the decisions of the cens@@ orship are taken behind closed doors , which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis through which they can proceed to court against these actions . &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go to cens@@ orship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in the war ?
the inhabitants dispute .

&quot; day after day newspapers reported in Brazil with glo@@ omy head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motifs . &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old killed in school , &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer murdered in Rio de Janeiro &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; Di@@ stra@@ thi@@ eves rob@@ ber@@ y pharmacy with military weapons &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tim@@ er sent 8@@ 500 soldiers from the army , na@@ vy and air board to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the threshold of violence in Rio achieved the highest level for 10 years in Rio . &quot;
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization Global Justice even called upon the UN to intervene .
reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; at least find the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; the newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; known for detailed reporting on violence in Rio published the editorial &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; in which she announced a new section called &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the motives for their decision declared the newspaper so :
&quot; extra will continue to report about crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc . whatever happens in Rio will be published in the section &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal ! &quot;
this is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
&quot; in a four minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , declared that this decision was no reason for pride but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ c in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize the war at all .
&quot; in the same video , a journalist tells the newspaper that according to the Institute for Internal Security , there are 8@@ 43 domains controlled by criminal organisations . &quot;
in the editorial the paper continues to write :
&quot; we are aware that a war discourse , if it is distorted , can also be used to cover the atro@@ cities of the police , which only shoots and then asks questions . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Ma@@ fia and its partners . &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; har@@ ms more than it uses ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , journalist C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira ar@@ gues that violence as a &quot; war &quot; ar@@ gues . &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as shown in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historical and compl@@ ac@@ ent neglect of the public service . &quot;
reminder : the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than just its capital .

&quot; according to C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia , Rio de Janeiro is wrong : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics of 2015 in the north and north @-@ east of the country . &quot;
none of these cities are located in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; if we look at the Mor@@ dr@@ ates per state , Rio is in place 16 , &quot; she writes . &quot;
&quot; the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , has pointed out that , as C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia points out , the state security policy has been repeated for years . &quot;
&quot; the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003 , was one of these security policy measures aimed at conqu@@ ering a F@@ av@@ ela by using a massive police custody and permanently station@@ ed there . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , however , the U@@ PP was increasingly under bombar@@ d@@ ment after several reports of har@@ ass@@ ment and repression against the poor communities , which should protect the newly created police unit . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux rec@@ ited from one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio prefers serious consequences for people . &quot;
&quot; this calls for the state to use means and ways that are typical of a war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape and becomes the object for &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost balls . &quot; &quot;
&quot; war , or since , fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as continue to suffer in Rio . &quot;
&quot; one week it is now time for the police to c@@ row up the mountain with the F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho , to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a fruit seller died as a result of gun@@ shots fired by the police from a helicopter . &quot;

to stay alive : besi@@ eg@@ ed Syri@@ ans learn to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer under brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to victory Watch , a joint initiative of the peace organisation PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , in Damascus and surrounding , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ li@@ b currently around one million Syri@@ ans are in a state of siege . &quot;
&quot; the East Gh@@ out@@ a region is particularly heavily affected , where chemical weapons attack on 21 August 2013 demanded hundreds of civilians . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition assume the basis of investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was perpet@@ rated by the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these rebel @-@ controlled areas have been under siege by rebel forces outside Damascus , which led people to rely on locally made or through tunnels and control points . &quot;
&quot; through years of block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian activists and academ@@ ics teach the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , as they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ near@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; mushrooms do not belong to the traditional foods planted in Syria , and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besi@@ eg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the right of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we chose to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years to make this project known and expressed its relief that it is gaining more and more &quot; awareness . &quot;
&quot; in order to collect money for the initiative , we use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ near@@ da . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to give 125 families a knowledge of plant@@ ation of mushrooms , says Dr. Lei@@ la on Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of about 12,@@ 700 € but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ do by Monday , September 4th , 2017 . &quot;
the initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
&quot; because of the fuel shortage , locally produced plastic fuel is used to supply the generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they began &quot; production of fung@@ al seeds from the regions , &quot; before they checked out their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
&quot; then they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub . when this was done , they used a larger tub . and so on . &quot;
now they have designed an educational farm for the region . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed fung@@ i throughout Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge . &quot;
Dr. Lei@@ la stated that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the mushroom breeding for various reasons &quot; &quot; : breaking the siege . &quot;
providing a new source of food on the market .
&quot; spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food resi@@ dues ( like paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , etc . ) for the production of new foods . &quot;
&quot; creation of new jobs , especially for women who work at home . &quot;
creating new jobs for people with disabilities who are bound to their homes .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea throughout the world , so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and the siege will be visible . &quot;
we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity .
the interview with Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la was conducted by Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b and translated by Elias A@@ bo@@ u Ja@@ ou@@ de .
Portuguese call for justice for the victims of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many suburbs in Portugal and called for justice for the victims of the fires that were ramp@@ ant in the north of Portugal .
forty @-@ two persons died and about 70 were injured as a result of the fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the government &apos;s last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
&quot; bran@@ dies were also registered in Gali@@ cia , Spain , where there were 4 deaths . &quot;
&quot; it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire erup@@ tions spread across the northern and central regions of the country , and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages . &quot;
&quot; in June , a similar tragedy occurred in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured . &quot;
&quot; according to the European forest surveillance system , which monitors forest areas by satellite images , about 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district . &quot;
so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is only a fire in 4 districts .
&quot; all of Portugal is burning in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15th , 2017 &quot;
some Twitter users divided images :

numerous videos are spread on the web and show images that allow better insights into what is happening :
the Des@@ i@@ rable Trage@@ dy
the aim of the protests of Saturday was the demand for better prevention and fire fighting measures by the state .
people wondered why the civil protection was not able to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ ão sovereign@@ s of the Bund der farmers of Portugal declared the paper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
&quot; after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , streets and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing . &quot;
this Sunday they did not do this : there are dozens of reports of open roads that were surrounded by fires .
&quot; in the woods of Lei@@ ria there would have been a similar tragedy like in June , as the roads were closed very late . &quot;
&quot; in addition , building permits are questioned in locations with a high fire risk . &quot;
&quot; a wide @-@ ranging proposal on the reform of the forest , which the government had brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments . &quot;
&quot; the government led to a loos@@ ening of the law , which allowed construction activity to fall if the applicant had a means of self @-@ defence - that was an open back door so that everything could be built , &quot; Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val will carry on in the same article of the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of light flamm@@ able wood , are spreading like in a vi@@ cious circle , following fires of this species . &quot;
&quot; these problems include that the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , when citizens sought information or tried to contact relatives who were offline . &quot;
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : it used its own civil protection data with the application fo@@ gie@@ gos@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real @-@ time about the location and the spread of fires .
&quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ gade and was so crucial in this fat@@ eful weekend in October that the servers did not stand up to the ons@@ lau@@ ght of the 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the website counted more than half a million requests . &quot;
even the founder asked for help :

&quot; in one night in the autumn of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban . &quot;
&quot; two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups that had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government , and Afghanistan became a land of terror and despair . &quot;
&quot; at this time A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy belonging to the ethnic group of the Haz@@ ara , was sitting in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner . &quot;
&quot; even though his mother didn &apos;t tell her at that time , she knew she wouldn &apos;t see her son much longer - maybe never again . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , the boy should break up . &quot;
his uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

&quot; Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat , dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been assass@@ inated by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt in@@ def@@ en@@ cel@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; the Taliban , known for their hatred of the Haz@@ ara , came ever closer . &quot;
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
&quot; a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan . &quot;
&quot; for a few years , he worked in a coal pit . the work was hard and made him sick . &quot;
&quot; once again , he found himself in a foreign country along with other refugees and dra@@ gged sacks with mort@@ ars , which were heavier than himself , in order to earn his livel@@ ihood . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was characterised by misery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; said A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site where we worked . &quot;
there were no services and no heating . we hung N@@ ylon in front of the open windows so that we could not freeze at night .
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ af took his life without documents in Iran and was ready to travel to Europe . &quot;
&quot; during the dangerous passage on the sea , he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities rejected his request for asylum , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 . &quot;
&quot; some time A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to aid patients twice a day . &quot;
&quot; true , Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers due to relatively high twin quot@@ as . however , it is also true that the conditions that find asylum seekers in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot;
the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes that the system suffers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; the vast majority of asylum seekers are housed in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; special reception centres &quot; . &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and uni@@ mag@@ inable staff . &quot;
&quot; according to the Italian law , asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they officially submitted an application for asylum - which can go for months after the registration of the asylum application . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who have no money for accommodation either depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street . &quot;
so it took A@@ shar@@ af too .
but his un@@ brid@@ led lifel@@ ong helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions soon .
&quot; after spending several years in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ af put his entire savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice . &quot;
this was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food bar .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now subject to documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Lux@@ ury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian Lux@@ ury - Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
&quot; the film was awarded the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to the official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a transition solution to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , some Afgh@@ an companies have emerged , including dres@@ s@@ making , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea for his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iters and kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy through the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes . &quot;
the Afgh@@ an entrepreneur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the Peace &amp; amp Restaurant in Pad@@ ua ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna and a sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ a &apos;s goals , however , extend far beyond the Italian gastronomy trade and retail industry and go back to the country which he had forced to leave as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where there is a risk , there are also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I can &apos;t live happily when I know that my people are suffering .
&quot; I plan a project for peasants from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and have to get the same possibilities as everyone else . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af also gre@@ ets plans for opening a factory in Kab@@ ul where people can learn packaging and preservation techniques . &quot; &quot; so they can sell their crop sur@@ pl@@ uses on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development of a successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end stability and prosperity are at the end . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey himself , and now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path . &quot;
&quot; citizen report : Egypt draft bills allow shut@@ down of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in prison . &quot;
he reported on the clearing of the camp of Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo that prot@@ ested against the release of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

&quot; global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ tizen &apos;s report is an international snapshot , challenges , wins and emerging trends in global Internet rights &quot;
the Egyptian Parliament reviews a draft bill suggest@@ ing that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook after registering with a government authority .
&quot; users must register to use social networks within six months of successful law decision on the authority &apos;s website , indicating their full name and identity number . &quot;
those who miss this step may be sentenced to up to six months in prison or the final payment of a pen@@ al .
&quot; the law , which was promoted by sixty members of parliament , is currently under the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; in May another MP submitted a bill of law , in which tough@@ er pen@@ alties for the insul@@ t of the president or high officials would be introduced . &quot;
&quot; under Egyptian law , the president and state institutions are already pun@@ ishable under Egyptian law . however , under the legislative proposal , such a deed would be prosec@@ uted with prison and fin@@ es , according to legal experts from Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; should the law be passed , this may mean up to three years in prison for the convic@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly is in danger already for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 , when he demonstrated violence against demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the inaugur@@ ation of the elected president Mohamed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , as more than 700 prot@@ esters , who had been arrested at the same incident , four years in prison for a trial date . &quot;
&quot; recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to the 20th of May because , according to human rights groups , the prison management failed to bring the defend@@ ant from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan faces the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , pseu@@ do @-@ load of , among other things , weapons of possession , illegal gathering , murder and attempted murder . &quot;
&quot; in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iz@@ a acqu@@ itted the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were charged with their reporting on the pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block@@ ade on the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya Square in Cairo . &quot;
&quot; the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mu@@ staf@@ a and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested during the aforementioned incident , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
interro@@ gated Tunisi@@ an activists on backed documents
&quot; Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the interro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ in and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy project . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia was mainly interro@@ gated by the President of the Republic who , according to the plan , explicitly supports a controversial draft bill that would ensure business people and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption , provided they return all un@@ lawful funds . &quot;
&quot; the document published on April 21 , on the website of Na@@ wa@@ in , sheds light on how the presidential plans for the support of the bill will look like . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected his sources , stating Article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an press code , which re@@ ass@@ ures journalists the right to protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he stood in the District Court in Tunis on 9 May as a witness . &quot;
does China want to force the users of social media to submit their identification ?
&quot; according to new regulations from the Information Office of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China require a permit before they write or share news in social media . &quot;
&quot; in the rules , it is also stated that the registration with the full real name will be required . &quot;
analysts assume that the elimination of anonymous comments should be reached within social networks . it is still unclear how the authorities will use these rules .
Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to enforce these regulations only selective in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence .
do we see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
&quot; in May , state cens@@ orship Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat . &quot;
&quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register with the Land government as an &quot; organis@@ er of information distribution . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this term is part of a law dating back to 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government carries out a list of online services that organize the &quot; &quot; publication of information &quot; . &quot; the law also allows the government to make use of said services for removing content and to force them to susp@@ end user data . &quot;
&quot; these websites are currently web sites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ classi@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the image board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the email service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services . &quot;
Turkish court has blocking Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
&quot; a Turkish court had the blocking of Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia has refused to extingu@@ ish two English @-@ language articles , the information that Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , maritime affairs and communication gave up that the side was blocked because it was &quot; &quot; an information source that co@@ operates with groups in order to insti@@ gate a political de@@ fam@@ ation campaign against Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time that Turkey completely blocks the website . it is thus , among other things , China , one of the few countries around the world in which access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
Britain cannot stop to sni@@ ff around
&quot; after this week , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install backdoor programs that de@@ code data encryption . &quot;
&quot; the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence services to the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the consultation takes place until May 19 . reactions and suggestions from members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior . &quot;
