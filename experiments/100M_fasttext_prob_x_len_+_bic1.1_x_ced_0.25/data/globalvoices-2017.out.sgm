<seg id="1">"although I visited the USA at least once a year since 2012, I would now live there for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">"like many of my generation, I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American writers and used his sports."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless reporter who, with the help of Julia Roberts, covered the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate, who wanted to occupy the highest federal court with judges who were interested in his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"after Method Man," I was as if this is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that is what I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the US had only intensified."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said," America is the only country I've ever lived in whose variety is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very swarming love letter about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">"with his mind, he never holds behind the mountain as it is said so nicely."</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague, and openly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-Americans and women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people responded to his statements and voted in pairs for him."</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in the Republican pre-elections was the highest number ever reached by the party nominated candidate.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">"who are the Americans who support this bigoted person, I asked myself?"</seg>
<seg id="21">I couldn't reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">"as for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program, which receives people from all over the world, a deeply devout person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"the world outlook also did not agree with Peter Bhatia's current editor, the current editor of the Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">"slinging intolerance is also in contrast to the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fought the environment for her life, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son."</seg>
<seg id="26">She still fits to the dedication of Kristi Kappes who always helped me with much patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexities of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump broke his way to the nominated Republican presidential candidate, they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, it turned out that they were the exception to the rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on November 8, 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly White, presided over a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt against non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump because they either shared their racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to designate the Trump voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"assigning people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">"this is superficial and disrespectful, and implies an inability to understand those who act in a different way and think."</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their worries and fears over the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters, of whom are white, voted for Trump because they want to regain control over a country that she has disappointed?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they might say they are still important in America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick who commenting the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down on those who look different from him."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" Whitelash "(Ü):" white against all other ethnicities "; the white and whiplash spread based on white and whiplash, as the great Van Jones described, has exactly killed what America has done so splendidly."</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background you may have, America is welcome."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this country chose as his president, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose story as he himself says nowhere else in the world would be possible."</seg>
<seg id="44">"with the election of Donald Trumps there is, however, a huge part of the White America's promise and says: to hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11, the white man is back at the helm, they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">"on a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, would have a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan. "</seg>
<seg id="49">"the crowd answered with a loud" "No!" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"do Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" the crowd roared.</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" cried they and their voices became louder.</seg>
<seg id="56">"if someone, who is not like you, would have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and loud "NO"!</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan concluded with the words:" thank God, Mr. Trump, he is not your America. "36 hours later he was corrected."</seg>
<seg id="59">"the land, for which his son had fallen, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"that is now Trump land, said the message."</seg>
<seg id="61">"and all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could find no place in this new America."</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What is the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the Paraguayan town of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">"the music played in both places not only changed the lives of the children, but also a very close connection with..."</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the trash</seg>
<seg id="72">"Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists - but worlds away from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine."</seg>
<seg id="73">"for some years now La banda de Música (music bande) has been playing in the community: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome poverty."</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest in the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">"the community, located in one of Mexico's poorest provinces, is known for its drug abuse and gangs of violence."</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a chance encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered the youth a rare glimmer of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">"the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:"</seg>
<seg id="79">"as soon as they come out of school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"you always come laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the hustle you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, Bongos and the Conga."</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">"more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero, the children of Cateura - a village that is practically up-to-date at the largest landfill site of Asunción in Paraguays, are based on instruments made from recycled waste material:"</seg>
<seg id="83">"music with recycled instruments made from local solid waste materials, manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers have begun to transform parts of waste into instruments."</seg>
<seg id="84">"instruments imitate violins, violas, cellos, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion, all made out of the trash."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the repertoire includes classical music, folk music, Paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in an article by the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls the beginnings:"</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the trash. the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">"this changed as Favio, something he had never seen before: a violin made from waste."</seg>
<seg id="89">"today, there is an entire orchestra that plays on instruments made of recycled material and which is called The Recycled Orchestra."</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentation called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) records the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates approximately one billion tons of waste every year.</seg>
<seg id="92">"those who live with him and from him are the poorest - like the people in Cateura, Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn him into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspirational play of trash-to-music around the world.</seg>

<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork can successfully fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">"this post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that reports specifically about international, practical solutions for environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-release takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices for sharing content.</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa, it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberian waters before it visited the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly upset and inclined to welcome a criminal of this kind at their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">"in Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comes, Mozambique and the Seychelles rapidly mobilized themselves against the ship."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly, the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything," "recalls Benedict Kiilu, a senior employee of the Kenyan fishing authority."</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was then expelled from the waters of the region: it was not possible to catch fish there."</seg>
<seg id="105">"finally, it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars in Liberia on account of pillage of the country's fish stocks."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 founded by NRO Stop Illegal Fishing (Stop Illegal fisheries)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries that had then expelled the prime minister from their waters."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" with this, we have eight countries that are like-minded and work together. they exchange information and support each other when it comes to illegal fishing, "says Tony Long, Head of the Pew Charitable Trust Project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project provides technical support for FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="109">"illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, therefore it is extremely difficult to trace. therefore, illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing of regions."</seg>
<seg id="110">"due to the deliberate disregard of existing laws, by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystem can harm ecosystems that have a delicate balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but while actions against illegal fishing were once hampered by bureaucratic hurdles and also by the slugs that circulated between individual countries, actions happen today in real time, with traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"there, for example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news about suspicious activities or details that one had noticed or experienced during a harbour inspection."</seg>
<seg id="113">"fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive when they move on the open sea, via satellite data."</seg>
<seg id="114">"this allows the authorities to identify ships that are fishing in prohibited areas, such as those that indicate that a ship charges its caught fish on the way to other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"ideally, such examinations can show whether the involved ships have a fishing license where they were on the road and possibly also whether they have a criminal offense."</seg>
<seg id="116">"countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports on the basis of this information, which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay penalties, as in the case of the PM."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it is about significant financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer worth financially."</seg>
<seg id="118">"this is what we want to achieve," "says Per Erik Bergh, Managing Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting company dedicated to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the already mentioned platform was created to gain an estimated 20 million USD in lost sales, which the eight members of the HISH-i network lose every year because of illegal fishing, which invade East African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">"East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from around the world."</seg>
<seg id="122">"among other things, actions include sailing under false flag, fake license papers, fancy names, fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they deliberately utilise the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of a not fully organised control system," "says Long." "earlier a ship could fish illegally and a country could then say 'You may not run my harbor'."</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say "Come to me." and this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i now.</seg>
<seg id="125">"up to now, the closed front is working."</seg>
<seg id="126">"since its inception, FISH-i has participated in more than 30 studies of suspicious ships."</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has tracked and found escaping ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its co-operation with INTERPOL, the international authority for combating crime, FISH-i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime, "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that aims to help FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly being developed, also helps to track down the illegal ships that like to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to conceal their activities and their position, "says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO that also deals with fishery data and offers technical support."</seg>
<seg id="134">"some of the ships, for example, turn off their automatic identification systems, so they can no longer be ordered by satellites."</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland is therefore helping to build a system that connects different levels of information. FISH-i will help to find criminal ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations really influence the unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes this."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform with Google and the ocean protection organization Oceana: a platform that offers satellite data and can display the position of each trackable ship worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "join the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing - that's just meaning," "he says." "here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources for investigation."</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this at a global level." "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project in which a global system allows the pursuit of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">There are indications that FISH-i's activities do not only detect criminals but also deter them.</seg>
<seg id="143">"ships that used to be fished without a license and had hardly any consequences, now know that they are observed."</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i have now recorded a 33% increase in fishing sales since fishing boats buy more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia had helped to detect Greko 1, the inspectors found towing nets aboard."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries also notice these successes." "the effect is so strong that other countries now also copy," "says Kiilu." "we are a study object." "in West Africa several hundred million dollars disappear every year through illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"in 2015 six countries joined together to the so-called West Africa Task Force. now they also fight illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH-i." "security is the goal of leaving even more such initiatives and structures in other regions too," "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently, FISH-i's latest member country Somalia was able to announce its first big triumph: in October, it presented Greko 1, a ship under false flag."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also invaded in forbidden waters that were reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "taking measures against Greko 1 set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time, proof that such a special collaborative working method for the protection of the oceans actually works throughout the world. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London."</seg>

<seg id="153">The street movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are considered to protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on the inauguration of President Nicolás Maduro.</seg>

<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (about: the recovery of Venezuela) images of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them can be found.</seg>
<seg id="159">"the debate will also be conducted in other parts of the country, including in the Barinas area, in the regions of Mérida and Táchira, in the centrally located federal state of Carabobo and on Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta."</seg>

<seg id="161">"many representatives of the opposition saw in the inauguration of the current President Nicolás Maduro the chance of a fundamental change, but in the end the reluctance of a re-election was blocked by the official authorities."</seg>
<seg id="162">"Marianne Díaz, contributors at Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises the context of the government decision in its latest article as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="163">"in the context of the social, political and economic crisis, in which the inflation and violence rates are among the highest in the world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% for the annual financial statements) and in which a serious and wide-reaching lack of food and medicine, the referendum was the only way to reconquer its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance."</seg>
<seg id="164">"the election alliance Mesa de la Unidad Democrática or shortly MUD (about: round table of the Democratic unity), in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined forces, called upon to continue the process against President Nicolás Maduro's government, the Venezuelan government seat, on November 3."</seg>

<seg id="201">"in the trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, crimes committed during the Argentinian military dictatorship were investigated."</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano did not choose his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">"starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in the La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough."</seg>
<seg id="204">He kept the family secret for 34 years.</seg>
<seg id="205">"in the situation at that time, I thought that was fine."</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">"as a child with 15 years, one does not notice that one is manipulated by his father."</seg>

<seg id="229">"the prisoners are tortured,"</seg>
<seg id="230">My father took me four times to La Perla - all in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">"at the first and last time, he let me wait at the entrance in the car."</seg>
<seg id="232">"when he took me the second time, he ordered me to go out. he led me to a barracks, in the cars, furniture, TV, fridges - simply everything possible."</seg>
<seg id="233">All of it was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">"he gave me a little pack wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to wear it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a big lump of silver."</seg>
<seg id="235">"on that day, I went to the other end of the barracks, where the stolen objects were put off and kept me with a guard."</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">The prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">"I saw in it, and saw a couch that was tortured by men."</seg>
<seg id="239">She looked like a cot and metal feathers.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they attached the end of a cable. the other end was attached to the body of the person who was tied there.</seg>
<seg id="241">"they rarely tied a man with handcuffs to the bed, poured it with water and pursued him a charge of 220 volts into the genitals."</seg>

<seg id="243">The smell there was appalling... like a dirty rebuke.</seg>
<seg id="244">"years later, when my father was under house arrest, the same smell came from his room."</seg>
<seg id="245">I realized the smell once again and it became clear to me that this is the smell of a body in need.</seg>
<seg id="246">I could never forget this smell.</seg>
<seg id="247">And I asked myself: how is it possible that a person can do so much harm to another?</seg>
<seg id="248">I knew these people were killed</seg>
<seg id="249">"when my father took me to work for the third time, he led me to the entrance of La Cuadra - the area where the prisoners were tied with handcuffs and wore eye-bandages."</seg>
<seg id="250">"he spoke with" Chubi "Lopez (Jose López, a civilian who was also indicted in the trial) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cuadra."</seg>
<seg id="251">"in the background, I saw a number of mattresses on which naked men were lying down with the face - all tied in their hands and feet."</seg>
<seg id="252">"in the vicinity of the entrance, people munched quietly on the mattresses."</seg>
<seg id="253">"when my father saw that I saw the prisoners, he said," "Why do you look so, asshole?"</seg>
<seg id="254">"I said," "Why have you brought me here?" ""</seg>
<seg id="255">I knew these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">"they were cast into a pit, and killed and buried by soldiers."</seg>
<seg id="257">I know that because my father told me about it at home.</seg>
<seg id="258">"in addition to La Cuadra, some rooms were designated as offices."</seg>
<seg id="259">I know that "Palito" Romero hit a man there and killed.</seg>
<seg id="260">"according to the survivors, Jorge Romero, who was also accused of trial in La Perla-Ribera trial, was accused of death by the students Raúl Mateo Molina."</seg>
<seg id="261">"in the following video, Emilio Fessia, head of the La Perla Memorial, leads through the former torture chambers."</seg>
<seg id="262">The way you came in here is also the way where the kidnapped came here.</seg>
<seg id="263">"if you look at the map, you will see that they took about this path and were then tortured for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="264">Here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of dehumanisation.</seg>
<seg id="265">"when they survived the torture, the detainees were thrown into the cuadra until the order from the top was supposed to be laid."</seg>
<seg id="266">This was the lie - the euphemism - for the shooting of the people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="267">The 'war yield'</seg>
<seg id="268">My father brought home all sorts of stolen things.</seg>
<seg id="269">At that time I had no idea what the "war yield" - as they called it - was.</seg>
<seg id="270">"but when I was myself at the military, I was in the gendarmerie - it became clear to me that war spoils are a bayonet or perhaps military rabbits that are fought against an enemy that has been fought."</seg>

<seg id="273">"but when one goes into a house and the fridge, the record player, clothes, paintings, money... steals, then it is not a booty but vandalism."</seg>
<seg id="274">That is theft.</seg>
<seg id="275">"I have always wondered how my father, the leader of the security forces, could take part in this vandalism."</seg>
<seg id="276">I just don't understand.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was also an officer in the gendarmerie and I would never have liked to enter a house and steal everything in it.</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my dad could do that.</seg>
<seg id="279">Once he called me a criminal and I replied: and you who steal cars on the street?</seg>
<seg id="280">You are not a criminal?</seg>
<seg id="281">"he exploded rage, struck me, and cried:"</seg>
<seg id="282">"if you go so far, I will find you and kill you."</seg>
<seg id="283">"for this, we need no one else!"</seg>
<seg id="284">So my father was.</seg>
<seg id="285">I have no good memory of him.</seg>
<seg id="286">"as I said in the process, I showed a photo of then, on which I wore a jacket and a roll-collar pullover made of wool. both had my father from La Perla."</seg>
<seg id="287">"we were not poor, but he still brought clothes home."</seg>
<seg id="288">"at that time, the defence accused me of being a conspirator in this crime. I replied, no problem, they can weigh me on what they wanted."</seg>
<seg id="289">Anyway I was there to cancel.</seg>
<seg id="290">"" "the disappearance of the body is the last abominable act" ""</seg>
<seg id="291">"now that I am older, I feel remorse."</seg>
<seg id="292">"once you have children, you recognize the value of a life."</seg>
<seg id="293">One develops further and realises that it is wrong to kill.</seg>
<seg id="294">I even went so far to say:</seg>
<seg id="295">"well, so you executed people during the dictatorship, but why do the corpses disappear?"</seg>
<seg id="296">Why kidnap children?</seg>
<seg id="297">"one day my father brought a girl home, whose mother had been killed."</seg>
<seg id="298">"she was like our pet, almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl."</seg>
<seg id="299">"I always asked myself the question: they were tortured, but why were they killed?"</seg>
<seg id="300">They would have been able to put them in jail.</seg>
<seg id="301">I guess it was simply decided to kill these people. but why did their bodies disappear?</seg>
<seg id="302">Did these people not also have families to whom one could hand over their mortal remains?</seg>
<seg id="303">Enforced disappearances are the last abominable act to be done to a man.</seg>
<seg id="304">"my father told me when democracy was reintroduced, they brought machines to eliminate the mortal remains of the prisoners."</seg>
<seg id="305">"they were crushed and disposed of somewhere - no idea, where." "you'll never find anything," "said my father."</seg>
<seg id="306">But of course something stays always.</seg>
<seg id="307">I have seen how you killed people!</seg>
<seg id="308">Just to clarify: I have nothing against the military.</seg>
<seg id="309">I was even with the gendarmerie.</seg>
<seg id="310">I just told the truth about 20 criminals - including my father.</seg>
<seg id="311">The thought of showing my father was born during a conversation when he was placed under house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="312">I made him accusations because of all the atrocities that I had to experience with him.</seg>
<seg id="313">"then he suddenly said," "I don't know. I didn't kill anybody."</seg>
<seg id="314">"I felt inwardly repelled and asked me why all the exaggerated patriotism and the" "Western and Christian feelings" "they supposedly defended were actually good."</seg>
<seg id="315">Then I cried:</seg>
<seg id="316">How can you tell me something?</seg>
<seg id="317">I've seen how you killed people!</seg>
<seg id="318">You committed terrible crimes and you were forced to join me as a child.</seg>
<seg id="319">"he only replied," "Please show me." ""</seg>
<seg id="320">That's exactly what I did.</seg>
<seg id="321">"in 2010, I remarked the first ad."</seg>
<seg id="322">I finally realized that he was a criminal.</seg>

<seg id="347">"in the Japanese city of Kyoto, customers of a newly opened centre in which one can prolong their driving license, witnessed a very particularly failed translation last month."</seg>
<seg id="348">"the Japanese word" "Agent" "(" "older driver" "), which means" "older drivers", "was mistakenly translated into" "fearsome motorists". ""</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself from 1 to 20 September.</seg>
<seg id="350">Edited the original photographs by Joshua Levine which has been widely shared in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">"the mistake was the translator Julian Holmes, an inhabitant of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers."</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto-published daily Kyoto Shimbun wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"" "how could it come to such an English translation?"</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation corrected.</seg>

<seg id="356">"the flawed English translation was first removed. the term" "drivers" "(German:" "frightful motorists" ") was later replaced by the appropriate, although grammatically not quite correct designation" elder drivers "(German:" older drivers ")."</seg>
<seg id="357">"the Kyoto prefectural police apologized for the translation error. furthermore, she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for correctness before it was published."</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported the following about the apology:</seg>
<seg id="359">"we sincerely regret that older people felt offended by the insufficient correction (the translation) on our part," "said the police."</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News spoke a little more extensively with the phenomenon of "terrible" older drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">"the word" "terrible" "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers."</seg>
<seg id="362">"in the Kyoto prefecture, for example, 1,941 of total 19,460 deaths were caused by seniors in 2005. this corresponds to a share of 10%."</seg>
<seg id="363">"ten years later, in 2014, seniors created 1,803 of a total of 11,850 accidents."</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the widespread circulation of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">"for translating, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the source text and active language skills to translate it into the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">"the latter requires the active command of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally, the conviction that translators in the target language - not in the original language - should be native speakers."</seg>
<seg id="379">"for example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French into English."</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies employ no staff with English as their native language, which could produce translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translating, cost reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers studying Japanese."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies, who have no foreign employees, still allow translations to be manufactured in-house. then, the Japanese employee, whose English knowledge is appreciated as the best, is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are."</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widespread - often with fun results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"the confused and enigmatic sentences that arise through mechanical translations, show that this technique can't replace a human translator for a long time. this is especially true for a number of languages."</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the enigmatic prints that often decorate t-shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood at all."</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">"translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry. however, from large corporations or government that have the means to ensure higher standards, it is possible to expect more careful translations."</seg>
<seg id="389">"in the future, the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for their translations."</seg>

<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family living there.</seg>
<seg id="419">"shortly before she graduated from the university, she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house proudly spoke about her." she's like a daughter for us. "</seg>
<seg id="420">"the one who has become something," "she said."</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga never was treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">"when she was ten years old she began to work as Criadita for the family. in Paraguay, the more than 46,000 boys and girls, who are forced to work to go to school."</seg>
<seg id="423">"the business is quite simple: a large family with little money transfers their underage son or their underage daughter to another, wealthier family. in exchange, the child receives food, a training and a roof over the head."</seg>
<seg id="424">"however, what is not mentioned is that the children have to spend countless days of housework that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can be paid - and all that within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted."</seg>
<seg id="425">"this practice, described as Criadazgo, is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations."</seg>
<seg id="426">"after graduating, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls."</seg>
<seg id="427">"she spoke with Criaditas - especially young girls were affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced."</seg>
<seg id="428">"she tried to name things by name, because the feeling of gratitude that is injected to the Criaditas is generally not silent."</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarnara. "</seg>
<seg id="430">"on the one hand, the family, who in the belief that they complete their education, can improve their position in society and make" something out of themselves, "is transferred to another family."</seg>
<seg id="431">"on the other hand, the family who receives the girl and justifies their exploitation with the belief that they give someone a chance that otherwise wouldn't get any training and maybe even starved."</seg>
<seg id="432">The Victims of Criadazgo</seg>

<seg id="435">"in January 2016, the previously relatively unknown phenomenon, which takes place in the secret of Paraguayan households, got a face."</seg>
<seg id="436">"when Carolina Marín arrived at the hospital in Caaguazú, her body showed traces of violent blows. shortly afterwards she died."</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">"she was Criadita in the household of the former military citizen Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who worked as a civil servant at the Einwohnermeldeamt."</seg>
<seg id="439">"Marín lived with them in their house in Vaquería, a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital Asunción."</seg>
<seg id="440">"at the end of January 2016, Ferreira struck Marín with a stick until she suffered fatal injuries."</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">"a few days later, the media reported about the incident."</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations such as UNICEF or Callescuela were deeply responsible for the practice of Criadazgo for the death of the girl in the Paraguayan society.</seg>
<seg id="445">They called the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people gathered in protest demonstrations and called for "no other Carolina" to be allowed in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The name of the girl and photos was widely distributed in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay, more cows are registered as children," Tina Alvarnara complained. "</seg>
<seg id="449">Without papers it is much easier to violate the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="450">"without official documents, it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live."</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations called for rapid investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Criadita.</seg>

<seg id="454">Everyday life of a Criadita</seg>
<seg id="455">"the Criaditas are exploited not only as workers, they also live isolated from other girls at their age."</seg>
<seg id="456">"Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik, in which her father worked, had to register bankruptcy and her father lost his work."</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers had to work all the time and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to make money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went further to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent to the capital Asunción as Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="460">"in the house of their employers, Alvarnara worked between four and six hours each day."</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to divide the time in such a way that it was still time for learning.</seg>
<seg id="462">She got up every morning at five o'clock and prepared the breakfast for her employers.</seg>
<seg id="463">"on Fridays, for example, she cleaned the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor."</seg>
<seg id="464">"when the school was over, she went home again and had time to learn."</seg>
<seg id="465">"the more they were finished with learning, the more free time she had."</seg>
<seg id="466">But also this time was limited because they had to make supper for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="467">"Alvarnara says she never had to starve, but did not get unlimited food." "I was allowed to get more books from the master's library than food from the fridge," "she recalls."</seg>
<seg id="468">"the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathizers of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party that belonged to the Opposition during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989."</seg>
<seg id="469">"on some evenings the master Alvarenga forced to stand beside him and read editorial from opposition newspapers such as" "Sendero" "or" "El Pueblo". ""</seg>
<seg id="470">He tried to persuade them to give no faith to the official media reports about the dictator's regime.</seg>
<seg id="471">"the owner had found someone who listened while talking about politics," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="472">"they didn't often allow me to visit my family, because they felt that I would" "learn bad habits" "there again. that means that Alvarnara, who belongs to the indigenous group of Guarani, would once again speak their mother tongue Guarani."</seg>
<seg id="473">"their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had allowed her to lose, she explains."</seg>

<seg id="500">Image of Pixabay changes from Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="501">Published under the Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian parliamentarians have recently agreed to draft legislation on "regulations concerning the use and usage of social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">"when adopted by the Parliament, users of social media in Egypt must register at a government authority in order to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="504">"on the basis of the law, a place would then be established that is mandated to allow citizens to use social media."</seg>
<seg id="505">"within six months of acceptance of the law, users would have to register on the website of the site with their correct names and identity cards to use social networks."</seg>
<seg id="506">"if this fails to do so, it could bring a sentence of up to six months imprisonment or a fines."</seg>
<seg id="507">"the bill that consists of six paragraphs and curses in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as" any application that runs through the Internet and used to communicate with others by voice, video message and text. "</seg>
<seg id="508">"it is unclear how the law will be enforced when it is accepted, as the draft does not give a clue to how the Egyptian authorities should not account for the registration at the time of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to regulate the regulation on the level of social media companies."</seg>
<seg id="509">"Riyad Abdul Sattar, parliamentarian and promoter of the bill, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users received a user name and password from the telecommunications ministry to get through the firewall that blocks Facebook."</seg>
<seg id="510">"this could mean Egypt is planning to build a firewall on a national level around Facebook. due to those, it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information on their identity to access the network."</seg>
<seg id="511">But it is not known until now that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts on the spot are sceptical about the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">"Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist (in German" Senior Research Biotologist ") of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German" Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights "), told Global Voices:"</seg>
<seg id="514">I doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things related to technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">"in my opinion, they imagine that just as they control physically public and private rooms it could also be done online."</seg>
<seg id="516">"if I take them seriously, that means they will be setting up a strong surveillance system to filter out citizens who request permission or not. and that is a crazy system to monitor people's activities and also to bring them to a trial."</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically not realistic - but in Egypt anything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">"in order to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed at the legislative power of parliament and the constitutional committees before it goes to the plenary debate."</seg>
<seg id="519">"whether his acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not, the draft is in line with a pro-military way of thinking in parliament, in whose sense the control should be maximized and ensured that no deviating narration is present on the image surface," says Raoof. "</seg>

<seg id="525">"high up in the mountains of Kurdistan in the north-east of Iraq, the animal protector Hana Ahmed Raza and her team of scientists of the non-governmental organisation Nature Iraq are working to protect the ghostly Persian leopard."</seg>
<seg id="526">"a subspecies of the bigger family of the leopards, who fight through Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian leopards (Panthera Pardus saxicolor)."</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular type of leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">"as Raza shows in the video," the Persian leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish eco-system "and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on a large predator."</seg>
<seg id="529">"the chance to see a Persian leopard in the free wilderness is low and goes against zero. when the team in the video states that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera board, Raza breaks out in pure joy."</seg>
<seg id="530">"as a biologist, Raza is passionate about another side of her country, which is not only made up of war and conflict."</seg>

<seg id="544">"in early March 2017, the daily Kahoku Shimpo, the daily newspaper Kahoku Shimpo, documented the progress made in the last six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the" triple catastrophe "of March 2011."</seg>
<seg id="545">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in Miyagi prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and Fukushima and Iwate were forcibly evacuated because the tsunami had vanished entire coastal towns from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">"in addition to that, the Fukushima prefecture experienced a nuclear accident, already because of that, 160,000 inhabitants had to leave their homes."</seg>
<seg id="548">"from a local perspective, Kahoku Shimpo's special report shows what progress has been made six years later to rebuild the life of the local residents."</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper contains both the statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority and the survey results of those affected.</seg>
<seg id="550">"construction site in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate"</seg>
<seg id="551">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that by December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement houses (for the" "Device" ") were completed in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="552">"Miyagi recorded the greatest success among the three prefectures, where 80 per cent of the planned replacement houses were completed."</seg>
<seg id="553">"Iwate completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima with 70 percent is the final light."</seg>
<seg id="554">"however, still, six years after the catastrophe, evacuation of shelters (" "Ausserfswald" "), evacuated from the housing estate, cassavoru juutaku, can be relocated into final replacement houses."</seg>
<seg id="555">"after the triple catastrophe, nearly 80,000 people were forced to live in shelters."</seg>
<seg id="556">"in December 2016, 36,000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such dwellings."</seg>
<seg id="557">"nearly 40 per cent of the evacuated from Fukushima in 2011 still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful here. more than 75 percent of the evacuated evacuated after the disaster in Behel's shelters were resettled into final houses."</seg>
<seg id="558">"for Iwate, the figure is 34 percent."</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three prefectures concerned</seg>
<seg id="560">"as the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper could determine, 1074 of 1,100 schools affected by disaster have opened its doors by December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later it is clear that industrial rebuilding in the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">"while nearly 100 per cent of the fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 percent of the fishing ports have resumed their operations in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the nuclear accident occurred extensively in the three prefectures of the agrarian country.</seg>
<seg id="564">"Miyagi was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 percent of the land in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed farmland in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="565">"it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed land land of Fukushima lie in the" nuclear plywood. ""</seg>
<seg id="566">"in two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered largely, but also here Fukushima remains undefeated."</seg>
<seg id="567">"the tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are up to 90 percent on the same level as before disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can show only 75 percent."</seg>
<seg id="568">"however, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe nearly half of the coastal residents find it difficult to earn their livelihood."</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next great earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">"in order to be able to determine the overall picture, the newspaper carried out numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuated people."</seg>
<seg id="571">"in her introduction to the article, the Kahoku Shimpo paper explains:"</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami awareness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents took measures to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">"however, 55.9 percent of respondents find that still not enough in disasters prevention has been done."</seg>
<seg id="575">How it is about those who had to be evacuated from the Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">"in its edition on the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the evacuees from Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="577">"Fukushima had to experience not only the massive earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, the Fukushima prefecture was also a witness to the worst, catastrophic, nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed."</seg>
<seg id="578">"of 160,000 evacuated from Fukushima almost 63 thousand people were moved to areas outside the prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="579">"at the beginning of 2016, more than 23,000 people were resettled back to Fukushima, in permanent replacement houses."</seg>
<seg id="580">"according to the 2017 state, there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their home prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="581">"in the catastrophes, most of the evacuated refugees are still older than 50 years old. they are well known because efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima will have to compete with massive construction projects."</seg>

<seg id="614">Police Transactions</seg>
<seg id="615">"Goiás was not the only state in Brazil, where there was brutal police missions on demonstrators last Friday."</seg>
<seg id="616">"at protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro, police officers set up a stage for speakers, rubber bullets and tear gas."</seg>
<seg id="617">"Flavio Serafini, Socialist and Peace Party (PSOL), asked the police to renounce violence against demonstrators."</seg>

<seg id="626">"with the introduction of the law of Álvaro Reynoso, almost hundreds of sugar cane factories throughout Cuba joined the doors (photo: Julio Batista)"</seg>
<seg id="627">"the popular commune Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill, notwithstanding that there is no notable sugar harvest on site."</seg>
<seg id="628">It was two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane mills were paralyzed.</seg>
<seg id="629">"after the fall, the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory gradually lost its plants until only the scaffolding of steel and concrete remained."</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to reinvent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the job.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and commute daily to the factories that are still grinding.</seg>
<seg id="633">"Nene, a soldier veteran who rises every day at 4: 00 o'clock in the morning, the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not deprive his sleep."</seg>
<seg id="634">"he heard that there are sugar cane mills in the east of the region, which are in operation after a long period of inactive time because they were received."</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">"Nene remembers that in Mañalich the sugar cane factory would be preserved, but the promise was not kept."</seg>
<seg id="637">"the sugar cane industry has already resisted the plagues, the fall of socialism, the low market prices, inefficiency, bad management decisions and climate change."</seg>
<seg id="638">"in 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the quantity produced in 1910."</seg>
<seg id="639">"the news would have been a motive for concern for the country a few decades ago, but the bad harvests are not news anymore."</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old platform of the congregation saw even better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane mills were technically outdated and hardly competitive they became unbearable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories; the annual production goal was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They only left the factories that could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of the sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">"however, the sugar price rose again about a decade ago."</seg>
<seg id="649">"from 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the report published by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations Agriculture and Food Organisation."</seg>
<seg id="650">"if the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar export would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country."</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"today's day will certainly go into history," "these were the first words of the Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lavender."</seg>
<seg id="653">"from then on, the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began."</seg>
<seg id="654">"in the following years the shutdown of a total of 98 sugar cane mills, more than 65 million people, received their full salary for further education."</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane mill Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on 14 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez has been working in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">"when Nene, as he is known as a soldier, talks about the closure of the factory, the word he repeats most is" scam. ""</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all those questioned are in the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">"in order for the place to be preserved, they formed a full-time working group."</seg>
<seg id="660">"before the first closing year, the first letters began to come."</seg>
<seg id="661">"these were officially written documents, which were only distinguished in terms of the parts that would be removed, the address sat and the date."</seg>
<seg id="662">"all were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve any withdrawal."</seg>
<seg id="663">"from then on, the responsibility was transferred and the letters were getting more and more frequent."</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the factory for two years and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in operation."</seg>
<seg id="665">"Eddy Reyes, 64 years old, waiting for retirement in another plant, the Boris Luis Santa Coloma."</seg>
<seg id="666">He was involved in the shutdown of the factory in which he helped build.</seg>
<seg id="667">"with each part he removed, he dismantled one of his 31 years of work."</seg>
<seg id="668">The most developed industrial area of Cuba and most important worktops was wiped out.</seg>
<seg id="669">"in many cases, there were no alternatives for working places and services generated in the communities in which they were present."</seg>
<seg id="670">"we will never know if during the Mammoth speech of October 21, 2002, the former president saw in the eyes of the persons present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in use for five years, everything would go well."</seg>

<seg id="672">"since 2004, sugar cane has been extracted only highly by milling."</seg>

<seg id="674">"after two years, Gregorio Arleé Mañalich learned that many things change, but not always for the better when a factory is closed."</seg>
<seg id="675">"when the sugar cane factory closed, or rather, when they began to resign, they also stopped to asphalite the road, and this also disadvantaged other farms."</seg>
<seg id="676">"without work in the region, and with already advanced age, Nene and Eddy had to look for other factories."</seg>
<seg id="677">They were replaced with spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="678">"without the prospect of the future, many young people left the region."</seg>
<seg id="679">"in the area, a food factory was created whose production is not even for the provision of the church."</seg>
<seg id="680">The ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive.</seg>
<seg id="681">"at the end of 2016, Nene returned to the factory of Boris Luis Santa Coloma, the ruins of the place where he began to work."</seg>
<seg id="682">"forty-nine harvests bring the old soldier a pension of two thousand peso a month, to spend the years in retirement in Mañalich."</seg>

<seg id="696">These questions are the inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the protagonists.</seg>
<seg id="697">"because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in the US state of Nebraska."</seg>
<seg id="698">"this video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the area of the tribe of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called" Highway of tears. ""</seg>

<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs is in spite of the influences of globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">"many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the teenagers did not always speak the languages of the First Nations."</seg>
<seg id="702">"in the following song, that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the refrain is sung on Cree."</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved got some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars Hip-Hop group who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cree dialect.</seg>
<seg id="704">"on the Facebook page of N'we Jinan, the verse is available in transcript as well as a translation into English, which is translated into German:"</seg>

<seg id="718">"in Japan, you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant."</seg>
<seg id="719">"to show potential customers exactly what is on the menu, in the vicinity of the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (the" "Enables", "" "Plastics Models of the Courts" ") are issued by any food served in this restaurant."</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers look at these plastic dishes and then decide whether they enter or continue the restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">"in the Tokyo district of Kappabashi, there are a number of small companies that produce those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="723">"for most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so common that they don't even notice them any more. however, a new trend turns them into conspicuous mobile accessories and other gadgets."</seg>
<seg id="724">"at Naver Matomas, the Blogger itinii has published a series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist to shokuhin sanguu."</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new mobile phone tapes decorated with plastic dishes as they are shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">"many of these artificial foods were turned into kitschy collection objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:"</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few shooters fridge magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in food production is becoming increasingly more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">"in this case, an imperial-don (a popular rice dish with seafood) was turned into a cell phone stand."</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a cell phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">Also this part we made for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your cell phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">"designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the cell phone, this is already a great design."</seg>
<seg id="734">And that's just the beginning of an increasing flight into the coma.</seg>
<seg id="735">"some cell phone stand and cell phone designers allow you to create your own artwork. in this case, ikura or Lachswirl is used, a popular topping served with white rice."</seg>
<seg id="736">"on Twitter, some users had doubts:"</seg>
<seg id="737">"is there anyone who would say:" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile phone with laughter." ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I'll be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">"this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appetizing form, in order to surprise colleagues or family members pleasantly."</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile phone stand has the shape of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">"in addition, there are also rice balls (Onigiri), earrings and handybands from dried salmon."</seg>

<seg id="749">"in reports of domestic and foreign media about the notorious" "fight against drug trafficking" "in Mexico, the extremists and interrogations regularly appear only in statistics, but they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle entails."</seg>
<seg id="750">"the reports about drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, chief of the Sinaloa cartel, pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict perfectly into the background."</seg>
<seg id="751">"on the day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the grieving or the churches that have learned to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="752">"behind every body, behind every bone-find in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed."</seg>
<seg id="753">"for this reason, the Mexican news portal Animal Político has launched the digital project" "render a Vivir Con El Narco" "(German:" "living with drug trafficking" "), telling these victims a voice and telling stories of people who were involved in the fight between law enforcement authorities and cartels."</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project like this:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime not only makes us afraid of our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are far more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">"for example, when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk."</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of the victims</seg>
<seg id="759">"a video entitled" "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" "(German:" "how fear lives changed" ") tells exactly these stories."</seg>

<seg id="761">"Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who lost her father, her four siblings, her husband and two of her nephews on only a single day."</seg>
<seg id="762">"priests:" like every Sunday, we prepare ourselves again today for the task we have asked ourselves to go and search for graves, according to the people we have loved. "</seg>
<seg id="763">Guadalupe Contreras: "my son is Antonio Ivan Contreras Mata.</seg>

<seg id="769">"there is also my mother, who is here with me too."</seg>
<seg id="770">At the moment it has no income.</seg>
<seg id="771">"you are entitled to the insurance of my father, but it doesn't pay them out because they require a dying certificate."</seg>
<seg id="772">Where should we get it? "</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "render a vivir con el Narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">"we need to show not only the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community conflicts, fragility and state leadership."</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">"KYHB, a reader of Animal Político, wrote this article from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="778">"your contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal, no matter what form it occurs:"</seg>
<seg id="779">I have been familiar with illness and sensationalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I come across newspaper kiosks every day and see the titles with images that can only come from a textbook for criminology or from specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it's not normal that my 10 year old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (German: drug dealer) when he is big. and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the" heroism "of offenders when they walk through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"it is for me that as if they would ridicule those who have lost someone, and those who fear that something happens to them."</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere figures in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">The inaction of the people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighbouring village would be justified by the fact that they were "soothful."</seg>
<seg id="789">"I think they are trying to convince themselves that they remain spared from such tragedies, if they do not stir and are silent."</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article "Four months blackmail in the Capital District: how a family with threats was sacked." it describes how armed criminals squeezed money from their business for month until they destroyed not only the business but also tore their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">"the pain never passes away, the trauma will remain, fear comes up again when you are alone."</seg>
<seg id="793">"habits have changed, phone numbers also."</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">"the farther we are from each other, the better."</seg>
<seg id="796">She closed her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">"we want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they will kidnap you or kill you."</seg>
<seg id="798">"I asked myself whether weeping would dissolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="799">"Mario Gutiérrez Vega's journalist published the article" "The forgotten children of Ciudad Juárez: a generation of violence." ""</seg>
<seg id="800">"in the introduction, he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime?"</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">"he is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care about them."</seg>
<seg id="803">"Bryan is an orphan and he says he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, cook potatoes, make tortillas warm and" "chichi" "for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water, sugar and milk powder."</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakably for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared."</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">"his childhood was past two years ago, when he was just a few blocks away from his home, saw the bloody body of his father, shot by armed men from a car passing by."</seg>
<seg id="809">"born in Bryan, the situation in Juárez looked like this:"</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 as violence by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">"in 2008, 2009 and 2010 Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Citizen's Council for Public Security and the Government of the United States Government."</seg>
<seg id="812">"in 2010 alone, the public prosecutor called 3103 Morde. this corresponds to an average of 8.5 murders per day."</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave organized crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories continue to live in the face of ever new headlines. but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">"in addition to the project" "render a Vivir Con El Narco" "Animal Político has launched the Narcodata journalism project in 2015 whose goal is to illustrate the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking that has tormented the country over the last four decades."</seg>

<seg id="819">"but how is the year after something appeared for the first time? content in social media, whether it's true or untrue, tends to persist."</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">"since its first release, it has been misguided to find tragedies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="822">"this false coupling of picture and event -" "false description" "or" "false context" "in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is plenty of careful reporting of events in the DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria."</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for pictures to news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">"in 2010, a tank truck crossed the town of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tipped around and exploded. 230 people died there."</seg>
<seg id="826">"after the civil war, Africa's second-largest country had been neglected for years and thus devastated."</seg>
<seg id="827">"tragically, the tank wagon fell victim to it."</seg>
<seg id="828">"the authorities described a fireball that enveloped dozens of houses, including a cinema close by, full of people watching the World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses burned and scattered corpses were scattered throughout the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to infinity.</seg>
<seg id="831">"a picture with the title" "This is Nigeria". "from Imgur user Mystical Monkey, January 12, 2015.Several photos of the event form the horrible scenes of this day."</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of charred bodies that are lined up on the floor while people watch them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here history does not end.</seg>
<seg id="835">"over the years the same photo has been updated several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and falsely attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">"on 3 January 2015, fighters of the Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian towns of Baga and Doro Gowon."</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastic atrocities before they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">"there were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred."</seg>
<seg id="841">"but the figures could not be confirmed." "no one stayed back to count corpses," "said a resident to Human Rights Watch."</seg>
<seg id="842">"many were dismembered, shot or burned."</seg>
<seg id="843">"on the basis of satellite images, the follow-up time could be visually displayed."</seg>
<seg id="844">"the reason for the attack was also unsolved, but the military base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military of Nigeria and the attempt of Boko Haram to win land (examples from 2013 and 2015)."</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from DR Congo showed again when it was wrongly presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">"a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris."</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">"in fact, this improper use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a number of abortions; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="851">"in all these cases, the picture was presented as evidence of mass killings."</seg>
<seg id="852">"one step further, personal comments such as this example falsely falsify the image from DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to deliver arguments."</seg>
<seg id="853">The image of Sange appeared in conjunction with the deadly persecution of Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">"according to a lightning report published by the United Nations, those who were able to flee were beaten, rape and several dead, some by burning."</seg>
<seg id="855">"while others reported about the violence against Rohingya, posts appeared as follows, which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:"</seg>
<seg id="856">"this picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news page, which in 2012 falsely claimed that the President of Myanmar has said that monks and politicians had participated in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image from DR Congo to illustrate this information."</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames (frames) that pass through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photograph was used in relation to major discussions about the silence in connection with the assassination of Christians by Muslims or - to defend the Muslims - the assassinations of Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is undervalued compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">"to understand religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts."</seg>
<seg id="932">"a deeper question, however, is what happens when readers can no longer believe in these images."</seg>
<seg id="933">"with social media, there are tens of people who unintentionally strain the water around a tragedy."</seg>
<seg id="934">"suggests this mood of misconception and misinformation that actual atrocities are untrue and adorn the real horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?"</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent images has already been extensively debated (here for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">"one argument is that withholding images of a refusal is equal to the recognition of the tragedy. sometimes, these images are even asked by the victims themselves."</seg>
<seg id="937">"at the same time, the concern is that violent imagery is desensitizing readers and viewers, giving them the ability to empathy empathy (such as this study, which investigates how violent media act on helping others)."</seg>
<seg id="938">"while there is a lot to discuss about violent portrayals in the news media, the fact is that they are indispensable for today's news reporting."</seg>
<seg id="939">"technologists are experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against" fake News. "they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which an image suggests something, which can actually be used in the context or completely abusive way."</seg>
<seg id="940">"however, any investigation of false attributions should also take into account how international they can be."</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name untranslatable (e.g. unsurpassable) tries to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or at all not to translate.</seg>
<seg id="945">"there are words in each language: they express certain situations or feelings, which are often very complex or specific."</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these unsettable words are already well-known today (like the famous Portuguese saudade) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish sobremesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But everyone stubbornly resist any attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">"a word or an expression is not enough, which is why a full explanation and sometimes some context are required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word."</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">"most of these lists deal with Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and linguist of" untranslatable "Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages."</seg>
<seg id="951">"for example, in the blog you will find words from the VAT-clap language of Vanuatu, such as:"</seg>
<seg id="952">"" "vakasteglok" "- Imagine your parents in recognition of how they are concerned about you in your younger years."</seg>
<seg id="953">"and words in the Hunsrik language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:"</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - The comfort or laziness you feel after cold days, warmed in the sun. "</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words from his blog About:</seg>
<seg id="956">"they defuse other cultures, reveal other thoughts and awaken our curiosity."</seg>
<seg id="957">"sometimes you can influence how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this page, and want to publish more of these" unsettable "words and show how different, valuable and impressively these little languages are."</seg>
<seg id="958">"speakers of Treasure Languages, highly appreciated by untranslatable, are invited to upload their favorite words here."</seg>

<seg id="1155">"on 3 April 2017, several religious and bourgeois organizations took part in a mass demonstration with the aim of reviewing the public debt of Puerto Rico. March 3, 2017, participated in a mass demonstration; the march started at the Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went right up to the Plaza de Colón in the Old Town of San Juan."</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the grouping "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda" (citizen's front for the neural testing of debts) and the ecumenical assembly of Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of the re-determination of debts also submitted a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">"the people of Puerto Rico are demanding that politicians, bankers and government agencies responsible for debts are responsible for their corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1160">"we call for a financial audit and a management board without personal interests in public debt, with a fixed, our working conditions corresponding compensation, which acts in favour of the economy."</seg>
<seg id="1161">We are blackmailed and oppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people of Puerto Rico refused to pay a debt that is not theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>
<seg id="1164">Our pensioners will not find themselves declining pension payments.</seg>
<seg id="1165">We demand immediate measures.</seg>

<seg id="1167">"hence the so-called" Centre for New Economy, "a non-profit organisation without party affiliation with a focus on socio-economic development, proposes a law on state responsibility, as an alternative to the existing state supervision."</seg>
<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1169">Puerto Rico's economic and financial crisis requires a wide restructuring of state infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="1170">"without the participation and conviction of citizens, imposed measures are threatened by the people to be rejected by the people."</seg>

<seg id="1187">"the book, published last year and is available royalty free, contains a series of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression."</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is said:</seg>
<seg id="1190">"this book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built, and what the real costs are with which it is connected."</seg>
<seg id="1191">"activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and writers who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have been working side by side to view over the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create some sense from our different experiences."</seg>
<seg id="1192">"this book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15, 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1193">"his name was deleted from the directory of the Adra prison, in which he sat on 3 October 2015."</seg>
<seg id="1194">"since then, we have no information about its present state or place of residence."</seg>
<seg id="1195">"the introductory part of his book with the title Collective Remembrance gives his friends and family a voice that will push for his release, and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom, instantly."</seg>
<seg id="1196">"seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us have started thinking about their own fate, deeds and decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What have we decided for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of temporary extreme convictions?</seg>
<seg id="1200">"since March 2012, the web developer for open source and digital activist has been in prison for Syrian government authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1201">"in October 2015, Bassel was transferred to an unknown place from the Adra prison, a non-military institution."</seg>
<seg id="1202">"his wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the" "military police bassdrum" "had taken part in Adra as a" "top secret" "command of the military court."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she had been contacted by persons on 12 November 2015 who presented themselves as insiders of the Assad government and took note of an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His whereabouts remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">"a pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowing for the general public in Syria."</seg>
<seg id="1206">"Barry Siegel, a designer, technologist and at the moment the head of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book:"</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Bassels's cultural prototypes was more prescient than the work he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">"Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crossroads of numerous civilizations and here merge Greek-Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences."</seg>
<seg id="1209">"at that time, Bassel could not know that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would do everything to wipe out this architecture, which embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world."</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strip in digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">"tragically, Bassel has not yet completed this project."</seg>
<seg id="1212">"Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and wrote about her husband's passion to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:"</seg>
<seg id="1213">"I spent my whole life with it, dreaming of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace it."</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">"Bassel taught me English, even when he was already in jail."</seg>
<seg id="1216">"I learned to read, write and speak English well."</seg>
<seg id="1217">"he has always shared his knowledge with anyone who has asked. he has taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English."</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">"he also taught other prisoners, how they use computers, at least theoretically without actually holding one in their hands."</seg>
<seg id="1221">"Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a prolapse that she wrote in 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was in prison."</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together for a year together.</seg>
<seg id="1223">"she smuggled the lyrics to him, when she visited him and he translated them out of Arabic into English."</seg>

<seg id="1255">"Mosambians responded with anger to a corruption case, in which a government member returned after half of his sentence to the workplace in the state apparatus in which corruption was committed."</seg>
<seg id="1256">"this is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison in 2010 along with four other defendants because of the scattering of 54 million Swiss francs."</seg>
<seg id="1257">"the money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique, whose Council presided by Cambaza between 2005 and 2008."</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 due to good leadership and immediately called for his re-adjustment to the company which happened on 19 April.</seg>
<seg id="1259">"in conformity with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic who submitted the request, there would be no obstacle for Cambaza to resume his old post, since the company did not complete disciplinary proceedings after his sentence."</seg>
<seg id="1260">"however, many inhabitants do not mean the action well."</seg>
<seg id="1261">"in an interview with Deutsche Welle, the Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública (CIP), a local institution committed to public transparency, condemned the company's decision to put the director back:"</seg>
<seg id="1262">"represents a setback in the fight against corruption and exemplifies the lack of transparency and is even a regression in terms of the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP."</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that even the firm should have initiated a disciplinary procedure against the infringement.</seg>
<seg id="1264">"however, the company was apparently silent and did not hesitate to take appropriate legal action to apply the corresponding functions."</seg>
<seg id="1265">"Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Muslim social media, also rejects this behavior and considers the case as" disgusting ":"</seg>
<seg id="1266">"if Cambaza was a competent type, he would be a consultant, after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them were sawed."</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could hold paid lectures and motivating speeches; he could advise and polish his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">"but since he is incompetent, he consents to be integrated into the company, which he helped to harm."</seg>
<seg id="1269">"therefore, it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for his silence."</seg>
<seg id="1270">Resisting!</seg>
<seg id="1271">"Bitone Viage, a young Muslim and student of political science in Brazil, says the director has no morals:"</seg>
<seg id="1272">"Cambaza is rewarded by the state because he insulted him, I can't believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that has so severely insulted the state."</seg>
<seg id="1273">"Cambaza lacks morality to return and serve the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but has instead served itself in the state itself."</seg>
<seg id="1274">"Cambaza used the state as a source of an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man, who was accused and eventually sentenced to a long prison term."</seg>
<seg id="1275">"honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded."</seg>
<seg id="1276">"Francey Zeúte prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, to remind that a thief is in prison:"</seg>
<seg id="1277">"thieves are in prison Samora Machel will not only be remembered as the first independent president for the Mosambique, but also as a sharp, piercing and - incidentally - prophetic orator."</seg>
<seg id="1278">"one of his most famous oral representations was when he vigorously confirmed that" an ambitious man is capable of everything, also the fatherland for his ambitions, his own individual interest, to sell. "</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook blocks the racist word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censored many users</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Burmese word "Kalar pae" means chickpeas or splitting legs.</seg>
<seg id="1288">"photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported"</seg>
<seg id="1289">"according to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or in general use as adjective" "Indian". ""</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook censuses the word" "Kalar" "or" "Enables" "as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">"in recent years, the rise of radical nationalistic movements has given the word an extremely decreasing connotation."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word used mostly by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"" Kalar "may normally be associated with racism, but the word itself does not automatically call forth hate speech."</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that even posts, in which they discussed the use of the word or expressed doubt for their use, were censored."</seg>
<seg id="1297">"in addition, there are several Burmese words with basic meanings that have the same character sequence like 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, stools are written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae', 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooking Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today because it contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">"however, he asked his friends in a witty way if they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a pun."</seg>
<seg id="1302">"the phrase ku la -" "healing" "(ku) + the question word (la) in Burmese - is very similar to racial expression, but the context is completely different."</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"Zin Win Hood believes that it will reduce the hate speech of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytic before it extinguishes all the posts that are suspected of spreading racism."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It automatically filters the word.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automatism will not understand what you write on Facbeook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">"what it should do instead, is to carefully analyse the mail and check it by checking the words side by side."</seg>
<seg id="1309">"for example," Kalar Htine "(chair) and" Kalar pae. ""</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good thing is that these dirty nationalists, who spread hate speech, get quite a good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action may send a strong signal to all those who hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experiences of social networks in China like Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game, whereby users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or an alternative spelling of the censored Word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">Author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to delete his posts when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">"when I became aware of this new Facebook directive, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically, my mail was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to collect, post and share content for 24 hours because the post" "Facebook Community Standards" "did not meet."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of messages from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, who has nothing to do with hate speech:"</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"in the post, the author informed his opinion of why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad."</seg>
<seg id="1321">"Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community ask for advice:"</seg>
<seg id="1322">"Facebook likes a benevolent intention to lessen racism in Burma through its platform, but it does not work like that."</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the various communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"in addition, it appears as if they have started this without local context or technical support, and have forbidden such words as" "chair" "or" "hereditary curry." ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">"even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the vulnerable posts."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"if they only had a little more respect for the 15 million benefits, which gave them a big turnover, that would be great."</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook automatic censorship has provided for a lot of ridicule among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">"instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun of Facebook and do not consciously write the word 'Kalar' in the context of hate language to see if their posts are taken off the net."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts containing no hate speech, but still removed:"</seg>

<seg id="1335">Screenshot used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">"over the past five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence have risen."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"among other things, hate speech in social networks should additionally heat violence in communities in Myanmar, especially in Rakhine area, where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"Facebook was criticized for his failure, the balancing hate speech on his Burmese pages under control."</seg>
<seg id="1339">"but instead of simply censoring the word 'Kalar', it would have looked better in the context than on code concentrating initiatives and learned from them."</seg>

<seg id="1345">"in May 2016, Brother Harrypersad Maharaj, leader of the Inter-Religious Organization (IRO), a group of representatives of the various religious groups of the country, said that the state should not interfere, because that, age does not determine maturity."</seg>

<seg id="1347">"UN statistics for the years 2002-2012 show that the share of children, who were married with 15, was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tobago, and with 18 it was 8.1 percent."</seg>

<seg id="1351">"a Hindu leader, for example, had no qualms about telling the critics of the children's marriage, they were supposed to take care of their own affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1352">"this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this really complicated matter, and at some point there were doubts as to whether the opposition would agree to the draft bill."</seg>
<seg id="1353">"but in early 2017, the bill was decided against the children's marriage - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent, who contained himself, so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him the law."</seg>

<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">"for more than a month now, Turkey has now closed its popular and crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1394">"day by day, it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share reliable information."</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series are resisting the blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">"although many tech-savvy Internet users are used to use conversion tools for blocked web sites (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence of the world), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia since 2008, as recently described in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockages of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Act (No. 5651) was adopted."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"according to China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1399">"while the platform remains locked, there are now several mirrors (pages that mirror the contents of Wikipedia and are often updated)."</seg>
<seg id="1400">"a solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform deposited all Turkish Wikipedia articles on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. calculator computer connections), which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult."</seg>
<seg id="1401">"in spite of the legal prohibition, however, the content is available."</seg>
<seg id="1402">"in a blog post, IPFS reports about its efforts:"</seg>
<seg id="1403">"after listening to the news (about the blocking of Wikipedia), we used everything to take snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, the ability to read the contents on a decentralized and distributed way is possible."</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to at least view all Wikipedia content even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org.</seg>
<seg id="1405">"IPFS also indicated that this step was conducted independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is merely screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website."</seg>
<seg id="1406">"however, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansickpe.org, a Mirrorside from Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to host similar MirrorPages when locked in the respective country Wikipedia."</seg>

<seg id="1411">"in essence, the server continues the request to the correct Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia themselves if they are locked in Turkey."</seg>

<seg id="1414">"a daring rhinoceros, Chitwan."</seg>
<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were vague with poorly positioned motives and washed colours.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to carry a camera himself and try to bury the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">"today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Nepal's animal world to the international stage."</seg>
<seg id="1421">"and his hometown, right next to the Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nepal's wildlife."</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first-class location helped him with his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">"I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!"</seg>
<seg id="1424">"I rested at home, when suddenly Navarre called me (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge). he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rapti river would be a leopard."</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the leopard was located and I immediately started to kneel pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar aspires to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Neptune Nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">"and he ought to know [it], for he stood against tigers face to face with face to face:"</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can't be bothered by the opinion of the sheep while sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">"also I was on the way home because of the darkness, when suddenly the king of the boy appeared. he immediately began to see us and he stares me through the Sal trees!!"</seg>
<seg id="1434">"to promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar places the logo" I click for conservation "(lit.: I clicke for environmental protection) on his photos."</seg>
<seg id="1435">"his passion for the promotion of Nepal nature and wild animals, however, is not always easy."</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days and mostly lived in a tent to take pictures of Ottern in the Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodations.</seg>

<seg id="1469">"this post was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and was originally published on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organization from India."</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was re-released as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">"in many parts of India, women are avoiding women with the greatest care to pronounce the names of their husbands or even older men in the family."</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use a pronoun or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">"from Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that they respect the husband because of social pressure, as well as fear of the consequences they should neglect the norm, this practice in life."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"last year, Malati Mahatoto from the indian state of Odisha was convicted by a mock court and rejected by her family and the village community after she had addressed a married relative with his name."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"the tradition of naming their wives also is common among men. however, they have much less fear to fear, if at all, they should not follow this practice."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"in the small village of Walhe in Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health personnel, housewives, a unique club, became the main topic of the city."</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone where they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">"as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, he is part of the # KhelBadal campaign, operated by the community of Video Volunteers and campaigning for the dismantling of the Patriarchate."</seg>
<seg id="1479">"Rohini Paist has been working with her video camera for seven years with the help of her video camera to detect practices such as children's marriage, to the exile of HIV- and AIDS-infected persons, and leads this club."</seg>
<seg id="1480">She reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the first video, which Rohini showed in her discussion, acted by women who did not call their husbands by name."</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided on this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the patriarchy with a problem with which women could easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"to pronounce the name of their husbands loudly, is a custom that they all maintain and never questioned."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not consider this is considered deceitful as a woman without morals.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband by name, wanted to try out at home as it works."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him from now on by his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">"with this self-confidence in the luggage, Rohini started their first discussion club."</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" patriarchy "before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected."</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the video projection, the women tried to get the discussion going with an exercise."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then she asked them," "If we can't say the name of our husbands, but they can call us as they want, that means they don't respect us?"</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day in which they had the name of their husbands on their lips," "says Rohini Pawas of the village of Walhe in Maharashtra over the breaking of an age-old tradition in which married women could never pronounce the name of their husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">"a woman was so shy that during the whole exercise, she was only getting sick of it; another decided to release the whole frustrated frustration against him and his family by cursed him."</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I'll never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"still in adrenaline rush about having broken with an ancient custom, the women decided that they would actually try to name their husbands at home."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">"in the coming days, Rohini received a variety of reports."</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put in her head: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"when her mother-in-law stared her, she was afraid and said that it was a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said: "Rohini thought I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in force.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the zinnoberred dot on the forehead, showing the Ehestatus:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why only women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would wear the zinnoberred point if he did it too.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I stopped wearing it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women have not completely stopped, but think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">"for many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange opinions and goals."</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "we make an excursion at every discussion club."</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want women to worry about who could hear what," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes for the first time in their lives; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things, for example how our identities are linked to our husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to be able to say certain things, no matter how small they occur."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"in a discussion round, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with the clothing."</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only worn saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most of them that's okay, but some wanted to wear a Salem-Kurta, a wide shirt over a trousers, they didn't dare."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after much controversy and discussion about the advantages of their own dress code, morals connected with the saris and much more, Rohini smuggled their own pair of cures (Oberhemden) into a discussion round so that women could wear them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next they have decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans and Rohini are sure they will manage it."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"to the question, whether in the five months since her first discussion club has changed something, Rohini confirms that things are moving slowly:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have only done small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tried it a few times, but then stopped saying the name of their husband."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including me, do it yet, but only when they are alone and there are no other family members."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberred at any time on their foreheads.</seg>
<seg id="1536">Women in Discussion Club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the haggling for more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothes - lie at the end of a difficult-to-navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">Giving each other self-confidence is aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a sacrifice of patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home and tells other people what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the Video Volunteers community come from marginalised groups in India and make videos about stories that are not reported.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"these stories are" news of those who experience it, "and offer a hyperlocal context to report on global human rights and development challenges."</seg>

<seg id="1628">The following version is published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The fall of the imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he had been hospitalized for liver cancer at the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">"in 2009, Liu was sentenced to 11 years in prison for" Subversion "(State Hazards), having participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto that demands democratic reforms in China."</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China described Lius case as an" "internal matter" "and a spokesman told he did not consider it as" "not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country."</seg>
<seg id="1633">"nevertheless, China continues to release calls from the international community, Nobel Prize laureate and his wife, poet Liu Xia, or to allow him a treatment abroad."</seg>
<seg id="1634">"while some countries have criticized the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others are completely wiped out."</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarised some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">"Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu."</seg>
<seg id="1638">"a spokesman, however, refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exert pressure in order to allow liu abroad to be treated."</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway and Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brenden have refused to answer questions about Lius release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">"the relationship between China and Norway came to a halt after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision."</seg>
<seg id="1642">"diplomatic relations were resumed only in December last year. only in June, Norway signed an agreement to resume the trip to China, as exports have been largely blocked since 2010."</seg>
<seg id="1643">"after the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo."</seg>
<seg id="1644">"due to his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his prize."</seg>
<seg id="1645">"during the ceremony, Liu was represented by an empty chair."</seg>

<seg id="1654">"the US Embassy's request drew a furious answer from China, with the Foreign Ministry's statement that" "no country has the right to interfere and irresponsible remarks about Chinese internal affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley announced that China should offer the couple the following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">"protection and freedom, such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his choice, to which they are entitled according to the Chinese Constitution and legal system as well as international obligations."</seg>
<seg id="1657">"the US Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz also adopted a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to release Liu and his wife unconditionally."</seg>

<seg id="1666">McCallum continues to tell:</seg>

<seg id="1676">"the spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, was very concerned in an explanation on 28 June around Liu and admitted that many asked him to pray for Lius well being."</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">"it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for whom he had been severely punished, led to a more harmonious, stable and prosperous China, which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world."</seg>
<seg id="1679">"I felt personally moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, who signed charter 08 which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China."</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem silly as Singapore is recognized as an independent state at an international level.</seg>
<seg id="1685">"but according to the Minister of Justice, K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be regarded as a city."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during a meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association, the Minister noted that many people criticized the dominance of Singapore's only political party because they compared Singapore to other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supports that Singapore should be regarded as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people commit a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to "twist the logic" in order to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this valuable country, we can say that we are not a country in the end."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you're not my country, whose land is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons given by Shanmugam were not very noble: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of it, he inevitably appeared undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"on the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently guided by a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"as soon as one reaches the central point of the topic, the good old lyre appears again from the authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, leaving the twisted logic, because it fits better to their power."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"in the end the last week of Shanmugam was given answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judiciary, our political system, really non-replies."</seg>
<seg id="1703">He tarnished the relevant questions with non-answers in a rational way.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls on Shanmugam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"if Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to which country belongs our city..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"in short, I don't understand anything."</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the effort to clarify this point if he was paid high to be part of the Government of the City of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">"by publishing his commentary on the blog, he points out to the critics that one should start reading the entire transcript of the conference to better understand the context of Shanmugam's statements, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"when he said that Singapore was rather a" city "than a country," he explained why the Singapore elections are so unequal, even if we enjoy free and just elections. "</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities have seen a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"when he said that Singapore was not a country, he obviously did not mean it in this sense!"</seg>
<seg id="1714">"Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, a leader of a growing generation, which makes such a polemical statement."</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said...</seg>
<seg id="1716">"at least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard what I expected - I agree with them or not, but that's another thing."</seg>
<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes it correctly and is aware of what he is defending."</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review pieces the vulnerabilities of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"did Mr. Shanmugam" "faithfully commit a mistake" "or was it a Freudian writer?"</seg>
<seg id="1720">"if Singapore is not a country, we will only be seen as an independent and sovereign state?"</seg>
<seg id="1721">"if not, on which country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back?"</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique and it is equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">"since he plays an important role within the government cabinet, Mr. Shanmugam's statements are of serious importance."</seg>
<seg id="1724">"why do the people of Singapore do their military service, but do they not defend their city?"</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who has to pay back our Prime Minister bills?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink personnel ID?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">"journey of a Decade to Bejahung, Singapore is, and has always been a city:"</seg>
<seg id="1729">I did not say what I said...</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have annoyed many people of Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one ever said Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"I can understand that we often hear statements like" the defense of the country, above all, "etc."</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should rather speak of the defense of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1739">Global Voices recently asked his editors: what is the most misunderstood aspect of your home or homeland?</seg>
<seg id="1740">"their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series, revealing rumors about certain parts of the world and to be shown another facet."</seg>
<seg id="1741">"the newest part of this series comes from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan."</seg>
<seg id="1742">"the question that is most asked of me in Japan is," Are you Americans? ""</seg>
<seg id="1743">"no, I'm sorry," I answer. "I come from Canada." since 1994, I have been living in Japan. "</seg>
<seg id="1744">"depending on the situation the conversation is taking place, it is considered polite to show interest in his conversation partner by placing personal questions."</seg>
<seg id="1745">"my clarification is usually followed by the standard answer:" Oh, Rocky Mountains, Ice Hockey, Nature. "many Canadians may boil inwardly when they are held for Americans, but that doesn't bother me."</seg>
<seg id="1746">"for someone who does not know himself, there is little difference between Canadians."</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians carry a Canadian flag clearly visible on their rucksack when they travel.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All love Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">"Americans, on the other hand,...."</seg>
<seg id="1750">"so it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11."</seg>
<seg id="1751">Canadians have always carried small maple leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours.</seg>

<seg id="1753">There are no weapons with us!</seg>
<seg id="1754">Same-sex marriages have been legal in Canada since 2005!</seg>
<seg id="1755">All seem to think Canada is so great.</seg>
<seg id="1756">We are polite.</seg>
<seg id="1757">"obviously, we often say" sorry. ""</seg>
<seg id="1758">Canada is said to be the most tolerant country towards ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="1759">We are not as these types south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We Canadians are nice.</seg>
<seg id="1761">I hate this.</seg>
<seg id="1762">"first of all, I have many American friends I admire very much."</seg>
<seg id="1763">"it wouldn't matter to me, for example, if I would switch to Johnny from Dallas for example."</seg>
<seg id="1764">With Marc from Austin.</seg>
<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">But there are also some problems with the stamp "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">"first: being called" "nice" "means to be idle, like the benevolent, gentle but tragically insignificant figure Ned Flanders from" "Simpsons" "(who has their own Canadian Doppelgänger)."</seg>
<seg id="1769">"if Canada is really a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, that would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that" nice "has no personality."</seg>
<seg id="1770">"there are no corners and edges, nothing at which one can repel."</seg>
<seg id="1771">Being harmless means to be inconspicuous and uninteresting and not to earn any attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">"this can be something good, if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, far from the things that happen around you."</seg>
<seg id="1773">"I would even go far to say that the desire to be free and alone, is a main characteristic of Canadians."</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own affairs only.</seg>
<seg id="1775">What outsiders call "nice" is perhaps simply cool courtesy.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians often talk about the fence across the fence.</seg>
<seg id="1777">"we lack the warm, open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends."</seg>
<seg id="1778">Luckily for us (and for the rest of the world) Justin Trudeau entered the stage to show that Canadians are more than just "nice." our prime minister has made Canada almost sexy.</seg>

<seg id="1787">"the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, especially how it behaves with the situation of the country under the junta rule."</seg>
<seg id="1788">"take a look at these videos of the video, which refer to some of the political topics that Thailand has persistently pursued over the past three years."</seg>
<seg id="1789">"the" 44 rules of the girls "may refer to the draconian section 44 of the provisional constitution, which gives absolute power to the commander-in-chief of the army on important national issues."</seg>

<seg id="1791">"the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime, whose vague and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activist and other critics of the state."</seg>
<seg id="1792">"for this purpose, a new unit was established in the army that monitors online content and prosecuted persons accused of having slandered the monarchy."</seg>

<seg id="1894">"in Mexico," Mama Africa "houses migrants on their long journey"</seg>
<seg id="1895">"Concepción González Ramírez leads a small hotel in Tapachula, in the state of Chiapas, at the border of Mexico to Guatemala."</seg>
<seg id="1896">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1897">This article by Amy Bracken was published on the website of our partner PRI.org on 19 April 2017 and appears here with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="1898">"on the path of migrants entering Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality."</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tapachula. it is located on the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">"it is managed by a 59- year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink glasses base and gold coloured earrings in teddy bear form."</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is owed to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm whatsoever.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for about $2.50 the night sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Haitian migrants arrive here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, Mrs. Ramírez tells the people come in full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they start crying:" "mother Africa!"</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mom Africa?.</seg>
<seg id="1910">"at present, it is rather quiet, but this year, Ramírez has received 200 guests at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"there are only 24 rooms, some have already slept outside on cardboard boxes."</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to reject anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">"she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick, she buys them drugs that they cannot pay, they massage them with a balm that exhausted from the long journey."</seg>
<seg id="1914">"Tychque Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived recently."</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mom Africa was an appropriate nickname for Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The Sebastiao family (with her daughter Mercalli who has a yoghurts) posing with Concepción González Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," he answers with a smile. "I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women."</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the cordiality of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"you have lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had heard from other companions of Mom Africa." "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," "explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti."</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells us that Haitians and Africans often travel along the route and that Africans are already talking about Ms. Ramírez's Whatsapp.</seg>
<seg id="1927">"like many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a construction worker on building sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"when the Brazilian economy was weaker, he began his journey to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months. he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he will be in touch with Ms. Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our Mother and we never leave her again," "he answered with a smile." "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. Ramírez tells her guests send her often text messages when they are gone to greet her or tell her about the course of her journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"she doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"Ms. Ramírez is perhaps very well known here, but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula."</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city leads a dead end to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter Valenzuela and his family have taken migrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">"he has begun to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar the night."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"at the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"some sleep on blankets on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside."</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I have lived in the United States," he says. "I have experienced what they are experiencing."</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people can help and others don't help. that's why I give them my support.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"after he lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants who travel through Tapachula are from central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them."</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to get money from him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"in Tapachula, he asked for accommodation and an unknown person, a single person, offered him their roof."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"a few months later, the family still lives there and tries to decide where to go the next steps."</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"in the courses, the travelers calmly consult their telephones."</seg>
<seg id="1953">"a minibus arrived today and brought 20 new guests, a large part of Somalia."</seg>
<seg id="1954">"Ms. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who went away."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"like a proud grandmother, she leaves her album with many photos."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"there is one of her daughter with African hair-spots, she has made a client, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old."</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sadly while she tells me briefly.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya se fueron," repeats it every time. "they have gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang people are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang by Twitter users</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in the west of China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones."</seg>
<seg id="1962">"on July 10, the mobile users in the Tianshan District of Urumqi received a cell phone notification in which they installed the district government to install a monitoring app called Jingwang (or" Web Cleaning ")."</seg>
<seg id="1963">"in the message, it is said that the app prevents access to terrorist information."</seg>
<seg id="1964">"however, the authorities decided to use the app for more than the fight against terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="1965">"according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the Autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture because, shortly after they installed the app, they had exchanged messages with a private WeChat group."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"in announcing the police that the app would determine and track the sources and distribution paths of the terrorists, along with" illegal religious "activities and" harmful information, "including videos, pictures, eBooks and documents."</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">"Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom."</seg>
<seg id="1969">"the main function is blocking pornographic web sites, from online scams, trojans and phishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online, and remotely control their own home network."</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with minors for minors is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these features can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">"for example, the" remote control "could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person."</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">"while reporting on digital censorship in China mostly focuses on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often gloomy for those living in remote, afflicted ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"in order to limit disturbances and discontent in the conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme censorship and surveillance measures as well as routine internet shutdowns."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"based on Twitter based media outlet" Images from mainland China, "the censored news published in China presented photos of a checkpoint where policemen checked the residents indiscriminately if they had installed the surveillance app."</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian ensure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification required people to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">"if you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days."</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced people to use devices that are meant for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by the rest technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China again.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"in addition, a Jingwang product description, from which the software can lift up the password requirements of a Windows operating system, and thus unrestricted access to the hard drive of the computer, also published images from mainland China."</seg>
<seg id="1985">"after installing Jingwang, computers and mobile phones become electronic handcuffs in Xinjiang."</seg>
<seg id="1986">The provisions in Jingwang may be a response to the instructions given by the City Council to minimize the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">"all government branches, authorities and related institutions, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the cyber security office when operating their computers and communication devices."</seg>
<seg id="1988">"Freedom House's latest report, an American human rights organisation, also mentioned these new monitoring methods:"</seg>
<seg id="1989">"in Xinjiang, on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi, the authorities published a regulation with the instruction to all residents and entrepreneurs, until 1 August, to register their" personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks, and media memory cards "at the local police."</seg>
<seg id="1990">"the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any" terrorist "videos. however, this action violates the personal rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a whole series of other possible offences, including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages."</seg>

<seg id="1994">"this is the first of six reports in the series" sleep or death, "in which activist Sarmad Al Jilane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison."</seg>
<seg id="1995">"far from our blue, virtual world you look at you and realize that you are all alone in a place where everything vanishes."</seg>
<seg id="1996">"everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly identifiable, both from the inside and from the outside."</seg>
<seg id="1997">One that renders honour to their name.</seg>
<seg id="1998">One that has struck down in a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaphors.</seg>
<seg id="1999">"but when the reality recovers you and you look behind the scenes - beyond the acting, the beautiful scenes and the performer - the characters turn into beings of flesh and blood, and everything cries after death."</seg>
<seg id="2000">"all doubts dissolve in smoke and you will be aware of your existence, even if the Earth is spinning on the axis of the Unheils. it becomes clear to you that you have been trapped between the walls that your parents, and before them your grandparents, stone by stone."</seg>
<seg id="2001">"they have arrested me and my father three times, but that wasn't enough for me to learn" my lesson, "as the chief of the security service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure."</seg>
<seg id="2002">He proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Five teenagers were torn down during a peaceful protest like weeds from the beautiful garden of our revolution.</seg>
<seg id="2004">"it was enough for the city to shatter the darkness of the night with" "Allahu Akbar" "screams."</seg>
<seg id="2005">"all the neighborhoods demanded, only my own."</seg>
<seg id="2006">"for the first time it was quiet, motionless, at the wrong time, even though I had no high expectations of a city that was stuffed up into the arteries with state security organisms and their accomplices."</seg>
<seg id="2007">"in the third night, things had calmed down somewhat after the power supply in the neighborhood stopped functioning."</seg>
<seg id="2008">I broke the silence by shouting "Allahu Akbar" from my house roof several times.</seg>
<seg id="2009">I heard my voice disgusted by the silence.</seg>
<seg id="2010">A few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to come together.</seg>
<seg id="2011">I was not alone.</seg>
<seg id="2012">"many friends, true friends joined me; we allied to a sumptuous picture, full of my expectations."</seg>
<seg id="2013">"at such a moment, you realize that you liberate the spirit from the lamp, but it simply doesn't interest you in the least."</seg>
<seg id="2014">"I received a call from my father:" "get ready, we meet at the military security building."</seg>
<seg id="2015">He laid up.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Then I learned the following: no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can give you back your voice after you screwed it all the way to the office of the security service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">I arrived there.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The Colonel Ghassan stood there with several of his men; my father was already there as I am now.</seg>
<seg id="2019">The Colonel Ghassan begins to say: "let me hear how you write" Allahu Akbar "or you are brave enough to cry out if we are not near.</seg>
<seg id="2020">His hateful eyes were on me.</seg>
<seg id="2021">And you're really grieving what to look into my eyes and not on the ground!</seg>
<seg id="2022">What I did then has nothing to do with courage.</seg>
<seg id="2023">I was 18 years old and it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building.</seg>
<seg id="2024">"perhaps it was my foolishness, vanity; perhaps in the revolution."</seg>
<seg id="2025">"I was so sure of my cause when I replied," "I didn't think you've forgotten my voice since yesterday."</seg>
<seg id="2026">"and I think I never stopped looking at you, so why should I do it now?"</seg>
<seg id="2027">It was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me and yet I don't regret a word of what I said.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"he puts it in solitary confinement and his father, along with it."</seg>
<seg id="2029">"his father immediately with it."</seg>
<seg id="2030">The stench of this cursed movement lies in my nose until today.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"he became a" "syndrome", "a mental torture that I was exposed for months."</seg>
<seg id="2032">I went through the courtyard.</seg>
<seg id="2033">In the first office I leave everything I carry with me.</seg>
<seg id="2034">"then again through the yard and into the second office, which leads through a gear to the individual cells."</seg>
<seg id="2035">I saw all the details exactly before I enter the room.</seg>
<seg id="2036">Otherwise they have allocated to me a larger cell this time.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I have to share it with only one other prisoner and I am allowed to sit immediately without waiting for their permission.</seg>
<seg id="2038">"after a few minutes, which felt like a whole life, the official left the cell, and I resorted to an old-tried communication method: beating the fist against the wall."</seg>
<seg id="2039">"I learned that my fellow prisoner was a" "first respass". ""</seg>
<seg id="2040">After a long hesitation he finally answered me.</seg>
<seg id="2041">"apparently in none of the surrounding cells lay a prominent middle-aged man, who looks like me and is called" "the doctor." ""</seg>
<seg id="2042">"in the perfect darkness, no prominent features can be seen on me, and doctors don't exist here; we are all just numbers."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"maybe someone, whose voice sounds like mine?"</seg>
<seg id="2044">All answers negate his existence.</seg>
<seg id="2045">Perhaps he was moved to one of the large cells.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Perhaps he will hear immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The investigator had assured me that they would release him if I remain.</seg>
<seg id="2048">Liars.</seg>
<seg id="2049">"I would have liked to have had a scarecrow to drive away all these crows, which fell on the fruits in the garden of my head."</seg>

<seg id="2053">"I was always convinced that black is the color of corruption, until I saw the yellow light that presented us the horror in person: the Raad (about:" "Donner", "alluding to 13th Sure of the Quran)."</seg>
<seg id="2054">They are here to be interrogated.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"thus the secret was vented: to protect the state security from us and prevent us from sharing the traitor and the terrorists in us, they speak in the alawitic dialect - so they played their denominational blackmail and locked the narrow field of view of their world view."</seg>
<seg id="2056">"this is not a house, which is not a country here; it is a curse that they call coexistence to transform the criminals of their clan into a hero."</seg>
<seg id="2057">"I enter the interrogation room and meet Abu Imad, a slender and stocky man; at least he seems to me."</seg>
<seg id="2058">"he begins a" pleasant "conversation, in spite of the facial expressions that derail him:" my boy, you are still young, you can start so much more important with your life than to join this diary and protest against demonstrations that will end up soon. "</seg>
<seg id="2059">I did not answer.</seg>
<seg id="2060">I am accustomed to not answering.</seg>
<seg id="2061">I can't really say exactly when insults and punches have become an ordinary means of communication for me after a friendly conversation.</seg>
<seg id="2062">When and how that happened was unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">"some voice in me said that I had to get used to punished, although I had nothing to do to deserve this punishment."</seg>
<seg id="2064">Of punishment in all its diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2065">His command is to pull myself as much flesh as possible from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2066">He calls this affectionate "confession."</seg>
<seg id="2067">It starts with a plastic pipe that probably comes from the cloaks.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Your executioner suddenly rejoices in your screams.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"give him the pleasure, you cannot measure yourself with him, and you cannot hold back your cry."</seg>
<seg id="2070">"my cries were not enough for him, so they exchanged the tube through a cable."</seg>
<seg id="2071">"at my first arrest, I asked myself whether the investigator had worked as a garbage collector before or if it belonged to the normal work equipment."</seg>
<seg id="2072">They intertwined four cables to present us the great invention of a giant cable from their point of view.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"within a single hour three of them changed, while I was still in line."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice, which is why I heard screaming."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"the executioner noticed the cooling down and found no pleasure in it, which is why he was next to an electrically charged rod."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"electricity flowed through my entire body, enough to supply my whole neighborhood."</seg>
<seg id="2077">My half-naked body lying on the floor was the perfect conductor.</seg>
<seg id="2078">The numbness disappeared and the pain was back again.</seg>
<seg id="2079">After two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">It must have been around midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">I decided to sleep again; let's say that was my only option.</seg>
<seg id="2082">"some hours passed, which came to me like minutes."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then the call to the morning prayer.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"the door opens and the morning light fills the room." Raus with you, Arschficker. "</seg>
<seg id="2085">"I answer with the voice of an exhausted teenager:" "my Lord, my Father must be fearless."</seg>

<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" I think so, because I am a man, "while he poured out Nescafé in two cups in water. it is the holy month of Ramadan; during this time it is planned for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset."</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">"basically speaking, the mugs speak lukewarm coffee and the casket of the Kent cigarette in the nose primarily of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air, especially if you take a look at the neighbouring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan drinking water - in order not to land in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, Jordan's Ministry of Interior has cancelled a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some parliamentary groups supporting the Islamic action front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontsman Hamed Sinno, contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert announcement."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"the MP and former spokeswoman of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert" "just" "had been cancelled because of the singer's sexual orientation."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which asks the old-established legitimacy of authoritarian regimes across the region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila estimated the Jordanian people as" progressive supporters of human rights, "who continue to stand up for intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement should probably not be simply shallow rhetoric, but actually reflect a more and more clearly crystallizing reality in Jordan, which appears clearly in Hdaib's work."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016, Hdaib returned traditional sex norms to Leibe by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who have marital sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the picture shows the skeleton of an unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the screen."</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red sea; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should actually trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">"in recent years, the number of 'honorary morals' has increased in Jordan - the inofficial outwardly."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"according to Human Rights Watch, the number of honour murders reached its peak in 2016; however, it is still alarming that Jordan has failed to support the institutional infrastructure to support women who have attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law to fight crime in 1954, women who are exposed to the risk of domestic violence are" "detained in prison indefinitely", "and for their release, many years of bureaucratic expenditures as well as the guarantee on the part of the family are often necessary for the woman to do nothing."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"also Hdaib's music enjoys great popularity and is known for not shy away from themes, which in his country long as taboo."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he cannot separate his music, which is full of explicit allusions to sexuality, freedom and expression."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"politics infiltrated me," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed" Hdaib takes up the question of Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"in" Lawla al 3aib "and" Ghareeb, "the focus again lies on poverty."</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political at the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib released a song titled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"in this song, a verse is repeated conspicuously:"</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market on which one, in his words," can get what you want "- either faith or non-belief, hetero- or homosexuality."</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notes that hardly anyone in Jordan speaks about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on the equality of LGBTQ + individuals were still heavily censored by 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular jordan online program Roya, to later realize that his comments were torn, twisted and censored in his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but was only a edited version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today Hdaib is open to the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance to homosexuals does not entail Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentions Abu Nuova, a poet of the eighth century, who still remains in memory thanks to his homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nueva, who later had to work on behalf of the caliph, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians not?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, has nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the hashemic kingdom, it is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service established several former government decrees and members of the teaching association, with the reason that they had critical comments in social media to the problems associated with the corruption that had been deeply rooted in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of this, Hdaib's opinion is just the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him, progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has now repelled Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the way of progress - that's how it sees Hdaib - consists of slow, thoughtful and internal changes. he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"in the end, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without any intervention abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of experiencing" it. ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region will approach a genuine and fundamental openness with the help of music, art and literature - and not by bombs, cluster munitions and artificially induced democracies. at least, he hopes."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"as far as it is, Hdaib will continue to tow and consequently also resist."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"this report was made possible by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, which Aman belongs to Fellow."</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big and extravagant war puppets are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origins of the Nebuta festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it is assumed that it is a variation of the Tanabata festival, which is usually also celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the feats, drums and dancing have been taken over more than a thousand years ago, in order to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi, to the knees."</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"we were able to grab some great seats, so we have a great view."</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can only imagine how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">"a community centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literally)."</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking at the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two solid cars are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">"nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true one - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer:"</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>

<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # NebutaFestival.</seg>

<seg id="2167">"rarely, external appearance and body care were as important as in this story, because they help to keep the Peruvian youth away from crime and to promote a legitimate profession like the hairdresser's."</seg>
<seg id="2168">"El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of Lima's capital, a region with a very high crime rate where street noise and illegal drug trafficking are everyday."</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">"at the same time, Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men."</seg>
<seg id="2171">"the trend, the appearance and therefore also the unusual hairstyles of famous sportsmen like Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to getting more and more normal citizens into the experienced hands of hairdressers who can recreate these elaborate hairstyles."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the unprecedented demand for hairstyles, which go to the ultimate limits of imagination and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of hairdressers" Batalla de Barberos, "which has been taking place since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2173">Experts face each other to show who can create the most eccentric looks as you can see in the following video (other videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">"educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and to get a training in hairdressing instead of bad advice, which allows them to find work."</seg>
<seg id="2175">"motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion."</seg>
<seg id="2176">"before the school year beginning in March, the school offered special training workshops and reported on some of its achievements:"</seg>

<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letters to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the edited version of the "declaration of love to guerrilla fighters" published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not even more important to accommodate people who feel expelled?</seg>
<seg id="2185">"this is precisely the question of the young Colombian activist Leonardo Párraga from the BogotArt Foundation and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation (letters of reconciliation), encouraging young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"only recently, her country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to this: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government signed a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), which forms the end point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"internationally, the signing of the peace treaty was so important that the Colombian President José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"before the Colombians, however, there is still a long way until one can speak of real reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"guerrilla fighters who have lived in illegal camps for many years, exposed to war rhetoric and carried their weapons round the clock must now be integrated into the lives of civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society, in turn, has become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred towards guerrilla fighters, must now take them into their ranks and support them in building a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians would join together and help in the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And exactly that they did: so far thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back to society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for each former guerrilla fighter who is to be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as Inspiration for the Campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for reconciliation was created at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to briefly talk to Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"this explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valentine's Day on Valentine's Day, but those who need it much more urgently."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he plans to share his love with people this year, desperately needed."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="2199">"up to now, more than 2,000 letters have been collected during the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá."</seg>
<seg id="2201">I never thought someone would forgive me</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students from the University Javeriana in Cali, two members of the City Council of Cali and Leonardo from the BogotArt Foundation, travelled to the camp to personally convict the letters."</seg>
<seg id="2204">The FARC members set themselves up as they had done before in order to accept the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they received no orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for everyone involved." it is unbelievable how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that lies between them, "said Manuela Jiménez Avila."</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, a member of the Governor of the province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after passing the letters, a former warrior led me through the camp of the guerrilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" Cambuches "(a kind of hut in which the guerrilla fighters live), I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go in, because next to him on the bed was a MGL-garnet, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"and I said," "Hello, what are they doing right now?" "he answered," "I answer a letter that someone wrote to me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never before in my life someone wrote something like that, so I answer it." then suddenly tears ran over the cheeks. "</seg>
<seg id="2214">"I embraced him completely, and sat beside the net-lights."</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was tired of the war, and was tired of being the faithful companion of this fighter for all the years, and wanted to help him write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life than war. to join the FARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers from starvation. "I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society outside waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">"until now, I have only learned how to deal with weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New Voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"at the start, students and some leaders of the FARC have joined a discussion group."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC had already been in hiding.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"this is why the leaders of the FARC have declared the history of the organization, their ideals, and gave an insight into their views on the peace process."</seg>
<seg id="2224">"the aim of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles," "one of them said."</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"hearing these people who had never heard hearing and had no right to vote, and recognize that the people I often saw as monsters and even hated people, who were turned upside down by their circumstances and their environment, was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives is hurting me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforts me that all people, including those who have killed and caused so much damage, can teach us something and give us a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo González, commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote the following letter to Darío de Jesús Monsalve, Archbishop of the City of Cali:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombians have been prophesied that peace would rule after disarmament.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people willing to take up arms, rise up and protest for their rights. and this is also completely justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we of the FARC now rely on peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"therefore we call all defenders of peace - no matter which race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, for we know from our own experience that nothing is easy."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"there will be many obstacles on our way, but together we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2244">"with terror, activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months on the persecution of gay men in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2245">But the threat that hangs on the LGBTQ community over the LGBTQ community does not arise only overnight.</seg>
<seg id="2246">"OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a transsexual woman from Grosny, who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is happening in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2247">"the LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya has captured the international headlines several months ago, after reports have been published that deal with the dragging, torture and killing of queens in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in Nowaya Gazeta; she threw a light on the methods of the Chechen authorities who arrested suspicious queer men and put them into secret prisons in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"they have brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">"Sabrina, a Transwife, was born in Grozny and grew up there."</seg>
<seg id="2251">"since her childhood, she felt she was a woman in reality."</seg>
<seg id="2252">"when she grew up, she became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, so she moved to Moscow."</seg>
<seg id="2253">"after a group of Chechens had experienced the gender equality of their landlady, the hunt for Sabrina was opened."</seg>
<seg id="2254">"for fear of her life, she ultimately moved to the USA."</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I worked as a volunteer assistant in a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I told me that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"it was a friend from Dagestan, a woman who was in trouble."</seg>
<seg id="2258">"she had no money, so I took her without hesitation."</seg>
<seg id="2259">"while I tried to help her, someone from whom I thought he was a friend, a copy of my documents and spread it everywhere on the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me."</seg>
<seg id="2260">"after that, the photos from my documents through the whole WhatsApp made the round."</seg>
<seg id="2261">"on 10 October 2015, I was attacked."</seg>
<seg id="2262">"when I was just about to fetch a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a man's voice saying:" here's a gift for you from your uncle. "</seg>
<seg id="2263">"when I turned around, I felt something in my body, but nothing hurt me."</seg>
<seg id="2264">"then I heard a sentence, but this time in Chechnya:" how long do you still want to dishonour the family, you cry? "</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">"I only know there was a young man, not thirty years old."</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and eventually woke up in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">"apparently, some women had everything to get along and to scream."</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was braided.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called for an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">"in the hospital, I learned that I had two spikes in my right lung."</seg>
<seg id="2272">"OC Media: in which nursing homes were you laid, in which the men or women?"</seg>
<seg id="2273">"Sabrina: my documents are outdated, my male name is still on it, but the doctor understood and put me to the women."</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very thankful for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">"when I read his name for the first time at his office door, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name."</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for having dealt with me respectfully.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I received threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">"they called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown."</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They demanded to send me back to Chechnya to prove that all was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">"they set absurd demands: some said to me, I must prove it by running upstairs without through the streets; others wanted me to appear on the official television in Grosny and say that I didn't change my gender, that everything was just bad news, and Photoshop."</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what should I say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people once said my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"they said to her," "They have brought a monster to the world that has shamed not only your family, but the whole republic."</seg>
<seg id="2290">"we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here."</seg>
<seg id="2291">"it was too much for my mother, and she laid a rope around his neck."</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors came and rescued them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">"at that time, I had to change the apartment several times a day."</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with darkened windows and a number plate with a 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"after it had happened for the third time, it became clear to me that there was a little bit lazy."</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for security reasons, I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with their help I left the country, but then something incredible happened."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">"shortly before I left Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived."</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought her without registering, without identification, without anything."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my cell phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"at the moment when I wanted to call my mother per WhatsApp, I received a message:" "you don't believe, you're in security, just because you left the country?"</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in which hotel you're stuck. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove it to you: it is the number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine this?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, we don't talk about gender equality, that's a taboo topic."</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still carry some traditional Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"as much as I desire, I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chat with camera, I really bother to look at the person they remember from their past - so to my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what do your friends, those who are dormant?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report last week in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">"for this, I needed up-to-date information on the situation in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who has sat in argun one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that during Ramadan, no people were arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan were not able to wait, and he did not lock a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"I mean, they probably invite the relatives, these take care of the problem with the person affected and at the end demand proof that the so-called" "honor" "has experienced through blood satisfaction."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are gay men still being held in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says that there are not so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, then, above all, those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives to face Kadyrows Court."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they are held there so that they can be presented as terrorists later."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say: should they be killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim they had attacked any village or military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people were not simply disappeared, they were deliberately submerged in order to radicalise themselves."</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this only a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was detained one and a half months in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard grew.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new from them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They just took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so-called Lord, this person was even when these people were taken along."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"until now, however, they were not presented as bandits, but there were no reports so far. however, we suspect that such actions are possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why would it not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know whether these persecutions and kidnappings of people belonging to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already occurred in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">"I think, before 2003, I was already known in the whole of Grosny when I still lived there - and I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2348">Seriously!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999, when Sharia was considered, I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, back then it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia originally wanted to bring us to" "civilisation", "but eventually rejected us back to the Stone Age."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">"Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked: I had dyed eyelashes, wore tube jeans and short tops."</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Security of Sharia never hurt me just one hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in front of the Russian Theatre in Grozny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, met a whole group of people like me."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several banks were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechnya language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is: "spire not on the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to have children when they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so they just closed their eyes to you, because they thought you were ill?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">"they never insulted me, never hunted and never struck."</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace period last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: until Kadyrow entered the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed prime minister in 2005, he began to speak about morality on television."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he did not talk about us per se, but primarily about the behaviour of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">"nevertheless, one could feel how people began to change in the city."</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who had laughed and laughed before looked at you at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">"in time, I left Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came back home, I could feel the situation in the Republic was steadily worsening."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"apart from that, I am still active as an activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">At the moment I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we organise teacups, gatherings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them to get food cards."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't make a cent for it.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people themselves when I rattled to the type of refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslim and wants to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Nature has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">"this is exactly the same as Chechens, who want to prophesy with foam in front of the mouth, that there are no spools in them."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the Dagestans have those who have the cabarers, the Russians too, and on the whole planet they are - but" not in Chechnya. ""</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I come from there, so it's unpleasant to hear something like that."</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus here.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims walking into the mosque and fasting during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">"you know, many think about transillity to men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different kinds of feeling, to be exact, different life settings."</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"I'm sorry that I will be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago."</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself.</seg>

<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"since the past few months, there has been a strong rise of suicide."</seg>

<seg id="2399">Photo: use with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi on 27 August brought the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, which is shaped by poverty and unemployment, into the limelight."</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the Ahwaz region in the south-west of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"he suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability to pay for his family, so Ahwazi human rights groups who want to work in Ahwaz and remain anonymous."</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video posted on YouTube held the moments after he had lit himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani hospital in the town of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources the burns were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died a short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">"it was not the only suicide committed in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"the Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim."</seg>
<seg id="2409">"their stories have one thing in common: it was all family fathers who felt helpless and unable to live their families on account of the persecution on the part of the Iranian government, to feed their families and to pursue a safe work."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination"</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region in which a large part of the Arab Ahwazi community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to make a living.</seg>
<seg id="2412">"a century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy assumed power and took great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"in the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population receives little from this wealth."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"it is often the victim of untreated diseases, hunger and deprivation."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Iranian regime refuses the Ahwazi-Arabs to work systematically in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries."</seg>
<seg id="2417">"the government has also built a large number of dams, the water from the Arab regions to the Persian territories, where provinces Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom lie."</seg>
<seg id="2418">"these dams have only led to worsen the devastation caused in the region, and to destroy the local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry."</seg>
<seg id="2419">The rate of unemployment among the Arab ahawzi-young people now rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">"Mohammed Pur, the Iranian general manager for cooperatives, work and social welfare, reported that 5% of Ahwazis who are looking for a job, completed primary school, completed 55% of a secondary school and 45% have university degrees."</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance</seg>
<seg id="2422">"Karim Dohimi, an Iranian ancestor human rights activist with residency in London, told Global Voices that the present situation, a mixture of" poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination, "leads to a" high rise "of the number of suicide among young Ahwazi men."</seg>
<seg id="2423">The reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians and an anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">"since functionaries and institutions prefer not to employ Arab workers, local Arab Ahwazi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors."</seg>
<seg id="2425">"this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime, aimed at annihilating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living outside their homeland of Ahwaz."</seg>
<seg id="2426">"there are people who had to change their first and last name in order to hide their belonging to the Ahwazi and thus be hired, because even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated, let alone speak the Arabic language or wearing Arabian clothes."</seg>
<seg id="2427">"given the circumstances that the Arab Ahwazi have to endure, human rights activists beat the alarm before the situation becomes explosive."</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and taking note of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I do not identify myself with feminism, even with the intersectionalist"</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. included by: Pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ayomide Zuri and was originally published on the website Afroféminas. the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"when I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women who call themselves intersectionalist feminists - react with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">"they even put out well thought-out scientific and social arguments ahead of me, why I should be a feminist and why we should be all feminists in general."</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, women nowadays earn less money despite equal education than men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">Women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women come to a glass ceiling sooner or later in various spheres of life, and that discrimination based on sex still runs across the many different countries and beliefs."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware and well-known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced that I am suffering twice and triple.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"nevertheless: when I speak on skin color, on racism, on black women women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; when I mention how we have always been abused physically, mentally and verbally, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists decide to remain silent."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"however, everyone agrees that women - all women - should come together to" "sing their voices" "and" "Kumbaya, my Lord" "to achieve equal rights (some) of women."</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they do not want to talk about sexualised violence in addition to an institutionalised form of racist motivated violence that we are exposed to black women in twofold manner.</seg>
<seg id="2450">"or, that black women and women of other ethnicities and places of origin deserve less than white men and women."</seg>
<seg id="2451">"that black girls and girls with a migration background are more often referred to the school than white girls, due to obvious integration problems."</seg>
<seg id="2452">"or that women in black spheres and women are exposed to a higher risk with a migration background, to suffer domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women."</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men of any skin color have the same rights; on the other hand, I cannot join as a black woman who refuses to take into account injustices in her mind, which refers both to the sex and the skin color of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging in a white-feminist sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"in 1851, Sojourner complained in her speech:" "am I not a woman?" "and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is in a historical sense an evil and marginalized being."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I refuse to join groupings, which also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropriation, in order to promote their egocentric program."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer try to expose white women to the importance of overlapping of skin color and gender. for some of them continue to silence the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women attempt to teach them of a better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although intersectional feminism was founded in order to give women of different backgrounds a home and to differentiate themselves from white feminism, there is still the word" feminism "in its name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I prefer to release myself fully from feminism and join the movement of Womanism, which was called to life for my dark skin and my status as a woman, so stubbornly that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism: we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, mental, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped that make up the black woman."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectional feminists will call immediately separatism and exclusion, after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected."</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I can stand up black women and women from other cultures because in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and my existence as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">"I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment where my life is neither ignored nor ignored nor rejected."</seg>

<seg id="2469">"Nabil Musa travelled again and again over the past seven years, mostly with surfboard or canoe - with a particular concern of the Kurdistan region in Iraq. his mission is to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations."</seg>
<seg id="2470">In this documentary of Emily Kinskey we follow Musa who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community.</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I absolutely wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was a child," says Musa. "</seg>

<seg id="2473">"Musa is a member of the non-governmental organization Waterkeepers Iraq - a subsidiary of Waterkeeper Alliance - who is committed to protecting the rivers, streams and waterways in Iraq, as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources."</seg>
<seg id="2474">"at the end of the video, Musa summarizes the urgency and importance of his work in a matter:" if we had no more water, how would we survive? "</seg>
<seg id="2475">"this video was produced, filmed and published for Ensia by Emily Kinskey, one in Erbil, Iraq-based documentary film and multimedia journalist."</seg>

<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the affected persons.</seg>
<seg id="2482">"a police commissar said Ada Báez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-partner who was violent against her."</seg>
<seg id="2483">"since the end of her relationship, some time had passed and the police said that her statement would be put to the files, but more could not be done."</seg>
<seg id="2484">"when another woman showed Balbuena because of mistreatment, Ada Báez's ad-informed ad did not help."</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later the second wife withdrew her ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"if women have a complaint at all, they generally do not receive support from the State."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"content 1 Strike and Statistics 2 Invisible mistreatment and a legal system that does not undermine Paraguayan laws: good approach, inadequate implementation impacts and statistics"</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is difficult to determine how many women are really abused, says Myrian González, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a social science research institution in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2491">"the numbers available, however, are alarming."</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015, the District Attorney General attracted 9600 ads because of domestic violence. 70% of them were violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of ads in police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">"there were more than 5,000 ads because of domestic violence in the courts of peace. 86% of women's ads arrived here too."</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the advertisements, 40% of women said that they were physically abused, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2496">"these statistics, however, do not show the real extent of violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the Paraguayan women's minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually shown."</seg>
<seg id="2498">"at the end of 2014, there are two women who don't do so because of physical abuse, and there are two women who do not do so."</seg>
<seg id="2499">"since women's murder in Paraguay is not a criminal offence, the prosecution authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered by their current or former partners each year."</seg>
<seg id="2500">"by August 2016, journalists counted at least 12 cases of women's suicide in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">"according to estimates, in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies due to violence by men."</seg>

<seg id="2506">"at the beginning she didn't want it, but she didn't give up. she should regret it forever."</seg>
<seg id="2507">"today, Mariana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos. but for two years she endured mental violence, one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult to recognize:"</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would become victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"when I read about it earlier, I always thought that only women who are too subservient because they are deceived by violent men."</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">"without naming a name, she wrote posts on Facebook in which she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated her."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos themselves. he asked rhetorically whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why they had fallen for so long by Carlos and did not leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least some complicity about it.</seg>
<seg id="2516">"Victoria Santos, who did not come from Paraguay, fought for nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner was mistreating her."</seg>
<seg id="2517">"Victoria is a member of the network Yo te Creo (" "I believe you" ") consisting of women who are all victims of abuse in some way."</seg>
<seg id="2518">"in the group, they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other."</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">"in Victoria's case, everything began with psychological abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her wealthy partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat her.</seg>
<seg id="2523">"Victoria's advertisements with the authorities remained without result and also from their relatives, she received no support."</seg>
<seg id="2524">"she carried out a trial against her former partner, who developed into an unpredictable legal fight between Paraguay and her home country, in which it was mainly about money, power and the influence of her former partner."</seg>
<seg id="2525">Paraguays laws: good approach and inadequate implementation</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good, but not applied."</seg>
<seg id="2527">"the display of abuse is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary," "says Victoria Santos."</seg>
<seg id="2528">"Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, also sees major problems in applying the laws in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2529">"on 10 August 2016, a bill was discussed in the Paraguayan parliament, which was known under the hashtag # Porelas (# fürst)."</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the movement # NiUnaMenos (# NoneneWeniger) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law foresees to declare Femizid into an independent crime and punish it harder as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">"in this way, the law text has been modified in a number of ways in order to also acquire the deputies of the law that are being denied the way for decriminalisation of abortions, which are currently prohibited in Paraguay and punished with up to five years imprisonment."</seg>
<seg id="2533">"the original draft bill envisaged the majority of (bureaucratic and economic) procedures, which must bear the victims of violence at present, if they just want to refund, and would like to receive a safe accommodation to the state."</seg>
<seg id="2534">"Echauri argues that the law is not effective, if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it:"</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay misuse is seen as part of inter-human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">"here, a rethinking must take place so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal."</seg>
<seg id="2537">"who is silent in the face of these facts, complicates himself and contributes to the offense that the perpetrators are offended."</seg>
<seg id="2538">We have to refund as long as abuse is no longer considered normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">"on 10 November 2016, the law was passed in the Paraguayan Senate. however, parts of the law had been changed, among other things, a passage which the partners in cases called for reconciliation of domestic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2540">The opinions about the changes go apart.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggressor to attack his victim again.</seg>

<seg id="2552">"the Sultan's regime is marked by the insidious efforts of security forces, especially domestic intelligence, civil liberties, including freedom of press, restricting and torture human rights defenders, independent journalists, bloggers and other activists."</seg>
<seg id="2553">"the authorities systematically restrict peace and legitimate activities in the field of human rights and prevent citizens, including activists, to freely express their views on the country's public affairs such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline."</seg>
<seg id="2554">"the attack on the newspaper Azamn, its closure and the imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2555">Azamn is an independent newspaper which has been reported since its inception in 2007 on corruption in Oman (an absolute monarchy) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2556">"on July 28, 2016, security forces Ibrahim Al-Maamari, Editor-in-Chief of Azamn, arrested, after the newspaper published an article entitled" High-ranking parties to the hands of the judiciary "on July 26, 2016."</seg>

<seg id="2563">"on 26 September 2016, the first trial in the trial against Al-Maamari, Al-Haj and Al-Abri took place in Maskat's trial."</seg>
<seg id="2564">The court sentenced the three journalists to prison terms and also ordered the final closure of the newspaper.</seg>

<seg id="2567">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fines amounting to 3000 US dollars each (7800 US dollars).</seg>
<seg id="2568">Al-Abri was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1000 Rial (2600 US dollars) after he was found guilty of using "an information network for the distribution of material that could pose a threat to public order."</seg>
<seg id="2569">"al-Abri was arrested on 22 August 2016, and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016."</seg>
<seg id="2570">"the Appeals Court acquitted Al-Abri at a hearing on 26 December 2016, but Al-Haj sentenced him to six months in prison for a year and Al-Maamari."</seg>
<seg id="2571">Al-Maamari was released on 10 April 2017 following the arrest of his six-month prison sentence in Maskat. al-Haj remains in prison where he served his annual prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2572">"the Appeals Court also raised the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the" "Azamn" "newspaper."</seg>
<seg id="2573">"despite the decision of the Court to release Azamn, the newspaper continues to see attacks by the U.S. government."</seg>
<seg id="2574">"on 8 January, the Minister of Information issued an order with which the closure of" Azamn "was extended by three months."</seg>
<seg id="2575">"on 8 May 2017, the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closure of" Azamn "was extended by three additional months, and with which the minister presented himself once again against the decision of the Appeals Court to allow the publication of the paper again."</seg>
<seg id="2576">The perpetual closure of Azamn and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which Oman has recently violated the freedom of the press.</seg>
<seg id="2577">"other injuries include, for example, the closure of the website of the independent magazine Mowatin and the exercise of print on Albalad, the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease its operation."</seg>

<seg id="2587">"Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, illustration takes place with his consent"</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is seldom or not mentioned in the media. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on site: there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">"diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious effects in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment for the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"secondly, research carried out by African scientists is helping to build up its own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of Central Laboratory at the Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ)."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"he grew up in Lusaka, Zambia in the 1990s, especially when the AIDS epidemic showed serious effects on national health."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"he left Zambia for studying in the United States, first in Louisiana, later in Indiana."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"as a post-doc at the University of Pennsylvania, he found himself on the HIV virus, before he decided to go back home to support the Serbian health system."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"with Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstanding of the media about this research."</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results.</seg>
<seg id="2600">"in addition, I am currently starting a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens."</seg>
<seg id="2601">GM: what do you think is the most important scientific topics in your country and in Africa in general?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">"this must change, otherwise we will always remain beneficiaries instead of being Macher."</seg>
<seg id="2605">"the solutions we get are often not suitable in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here."</seg>
<seg id="2606">GV: where does the financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are supported in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="2611">"it is difficult to find people who want to come back or go here, because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries."</seg>
<seg id="2612">GV: how is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work that you didn't have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">"RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money, a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet."</seg>
<seg id="2615">"laboratory material is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries."</seg>
<seg id="2616">GM: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is already an interest but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">"GV: how big is your opinion according to the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it focus on, and how can we support development?"</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">"there is need for special academic education, starting at any age."</seg>
<seg id="2623">"social sciences, computer science, big data, research into space, health care (non-communicable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly."</seg>
<seg id="2624">"GV: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa compared to Western countries, based on your experience?"</seg>
<seg id="2625">"RW: often it is the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that challenges here."</seg>
<seg id="2626">"the system, that magazines can only make articles accessible against payment (the so-called" "Paywall" "), also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research."</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "Open Source" seed producers change world food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">"this post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website of Ensia.com, a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding salad since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"its company offers 114 varieties such as Outreddish, the first plant grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for almost 20 years, Morton's work was limited only by his own resourcefulness and the question of how many types of lettuce he can get."</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">"the patents bear not only for individual varieties, but also for certain properties, such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green ton or crimped leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"over the past few years, more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cereal or cartel types. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts provide food security to the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition, Morton still breeds lettuce, but he needs longer since his work is more and more difficult."</seg>
<seg id="2636">"it is as if a boulder is lying in a river, around which I have to paddle."</seg>
<seg id="2637">"we have to do that now, but it is a break with the tradition of breeding," he says. "I think that these patents go too far."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they stand before judgment, no one can breed a new variety because all features are already patented." "</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, he is very careful and tries to use no material protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the US and everywhere in the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Römersal at the "greenhouse" of the station. there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds more like the movement from the IT sector and not from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for open-source seeds) is inspired by the movement for free "open source" software that provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and thus can be used permanently for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">"as part of the initiative, called Ossi, U.S. breeders may oblige others to freely use the seed bred by them."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"however, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it." open source "breeders merely allow others who buy their seed, breed it in order to breed their own varieties, and not to cut it out immediately - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg, control over seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants is important for food security and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"according to him, seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the open-source movement is not concerned with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not." "to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over seeds," "he says." "those who want to buy good, locally and sustainably produced vegetables, such as farmers markets, should also know that the way this vegetables is grown is threatened."</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "food sovereignty without a seed sovereignty is not possible." ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to continuing to share their seeds freely, as opposed to patented seed and plant characteristics."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered because of the increasing intellectual property rights available on plant material, which is therefore always limited, shrinking continuously."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, has worked in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about one third of all cartel characteristics are protected as intellectual property, making it suitable for plant breeders either at all or only difficult."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"for other plants, such estimates do not exist yet, but experts like Luby suggest that mass-grown plants such as wheat are patented as salad or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of the perspective</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants are bred so that they have purposefully desired traits - from those by which their taste or colour is improved to such, because of which they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for growers has more and more patents. at present, genetic diversity is more necessary than ever before, as the changing conditions are much worse by climate change."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail, Monsanto spokesperson Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"it contradicts, however, that intellectual property developers implement other breeders, as" patents and protection of plant varietal devices promote innovation. "" a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent expired. "</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"such protection does not prevent innovation, but encourages them by making more material and know-how available to the public."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton sees that for another 20 years, until a patent expires, certainly does not promote innovation."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"if you have to wait so long for breeding plants that have been adapted to the changing environmental conditions, you would have lost the battle."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a commonplace and should continue to remain:" "independent plant breeders do not have time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us."</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">This is what drives us and it is impossible for us to continue to use the best and newest genetic resources.</seg>
<seg id="2672">"overall, Morton is bothering on the concept of patented plant features:" we do not really create the features ourselves. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form it themselves and as a breeder we have no idea how the plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Depp, plant breeder in the U.S. state of Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding:" whoever breeds a variety, also breeds his own values into it. "</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures are required for their cultivation of mass herbicides which breed in its varieties this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is exactly opposite. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized companies (those that move on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto) patents possess, most of the smaller seed companies can survive without patents - either they reject the patent or they consider it too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both are the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton searches for Salate in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"Morton also believes that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents:" "it looks like I'm working with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that patent."</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I need constantly new material for my catalog, since I know that my competitors will sell my grades in a few years," he says. "with a patent, you are protected from competition for 20 years, with which I think it is pretty simple." "</seg>
<seg id="2683">"although the USA seems to be a leader in open source breeding, the concept soon spreads around the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture, which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, is a" open source "seed program. in order to preserve the seed of traditional vegetable varieties, the Centre is working together with farmers and helps them grow new varieties that meet certain requirements."</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to open source seeds and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German organization Agrecol works on an open-source licence, which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi obligation for breeders in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"(rules for breeding differ from country to country, therefore the Ossi obligation cannot simply be adopted one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)"</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally bred plants should not be patentable."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, an explanation is not yet a law; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference on" Open Source "seed systems in Ethiopia, on the farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn about the" open source "seed movement and the global trend towards the patenting of seeds."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' program for open source seed systems explains that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for open source seed systems for which the official start of the year will be expected next year."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"a consortium of environmental protection and development groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit development aid organisation USC Canada and the action group on erosion, technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion, technology and concentration) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"in September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food - has published a report from relief organisations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation, and others."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"the report also stresses the importance of a diverse, local supply of seed for sustainable food systems - a connection that Luby von Ossi hopes to see more people soon."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological foods has largely paid attention to where and how something is grown, and seed systems have hardly played a role," says Luby. "we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their food."</seg>

<seg id="2742">"according to the Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte) Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte), Egyptian authorities blocked their websites from 24 May to 06th August. this resulted in technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including orange, Vodafone and Etisalat."</seg>
<seg id="2743">"also, afte documented the blocking of providers that was possible by bypassing Internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)"</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">"on Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of websites that VPNs offer began."</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice indicates the government's intention to continue blocking and filtering content that Egyptian users might have access to.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"in addition, the situation is aggravated by the fact that the decisions of the censorship are taken behind closed doors, which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis through which they can proceed to court against these actions."</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go to censorship and who will attack it next?</seg>

<seg id="2753">"day after day newspapers reported in Brazil with gloomy headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motifs."</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>

<seg id="2756">"in the midst of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the threshold of violence in Rio achieved the highest level for 10 years in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organization Global Justice even called upon the UN to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least find the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>

<seg id="2766">"in the same video, a journalist tells the newspaper that according to the Institute for Internal Security, there are 843 domains controlled by criminal organisations."</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested on 21 October in many suburbs in Portugal and called for justice for the victims of the fires that were rampant in the north of Portugal.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two persons died and about 70 were injured as a result of the fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the government's last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">"brandies were also registered in Galicia, Spain, where there were 4 deaths."</seg>
<seg id="2836">"it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire eruptions spread across the northern and central regions of the country, and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages."</seg>
<seg id="2837">"in June, a similar tragedy occurred in Pedrógão Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured."</seg>
<seg id="2838">"according to the European forest surveillance system, which monitors forest areas by satellite images, about 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district."</seg>

<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided the population with information: it used its own civil protection data with the application fogiegos.pt and informed the population in real-time about the location and the spread of fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">"the project was launched in 2015 by the developer João Pina to simplify the work of the fire brigade and was so crucial in this fateful weekend in October that the servers did not stand up to the onslaught of the 400,000 users who followed the fires: the website counted more than half a million requests."</seg>

<seg id="2875">"at this time Asharaf Barati, a 13-year-old boy belonging to the ethnic group of the Hazara, was sitting in the province of Ghazni in Central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner."</seg>

<seg id="2885">"the Taliban, known for their hatred of the Hazara, came ever closer."</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">"a few days after his escape, Asharaf found himself in Pakistan."</seg>
<seg id="2888">"for a few years, he worked in a coal pit. the work was hard and made him sick."</seg>
<seg id="2889">"once again, he found himself in a foreign country along with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortars, which were heavier than himself, in order to earn his livelihood."</seg>
<seg id="2890">"at that time, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was characterised by misery and exploitation."</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," said Asharaf in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site where we worked."</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services and no heating. we hung Nylon in front of the open windows so that we could not freeze at night.</seg>
<seg id="2893">"after four years, Asharaf took his life without documents in Iran and was ready to travel to Europe."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"during the dangerous passage on the sea, he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island."</seg>
<seg id="2895">"after the Greek authorities rejected his request for asylum, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"some time Asharaf was homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to aid patients twice a day."</seg>
<seg id="2897">"true, Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers due to relatively high twin quotas. however, it is also true that the conditions that find asylum seekers in the country are catastrophic."</seg>
<seg id="2898">The human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes that the system suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">"the vast majority of asylum seekers are housed in the more than 3000" "special reception centres". "these are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unimaginable staff."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"according to the Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they officially submitted an application for asylum - which can go for months after the registration of the asylum application."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"until then, people who have no money for accommodation either depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street."</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it took Asharaf too.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unbridled lifelong helped Asharaf to get rid of these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">"after spending several years in the construction industry for several years, Asharaf put his entire savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice."</seg>

<seg id="2913">"according to the official estimates, about 20,000 Afghans live in Italy."</seg>
<seg id="2914">"for many of them, the country is a transition solution to other European countries."</seg>
<seg id="2915">"in recent years, some Afghan companies have emerged, including dressmaking, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"in Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea for his restaurant Orient Experience, where the waiters and kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world."</seg>

<seg id="2921">"where there is a risk, there are also possibilities," says Asharaf with a smile. "I want to invest in Afghanistan."</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I can't live happily when I know that my people are suffering.</seg>

<seg id="2933">"users must register to use social networks within six months of successful law decision on the authority's website, indicating their full name and identity number."</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who miss this step may be sentenced to up to six months in prison or the final payment of a penal.</seg>
<seg id="2935">"the law, which was promoted by sixty members of parliament, is currently under the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be debated there."</seg>

<seg id="2938">"should the law be passed, this may mean up to three years in prison for the convicted."</seg>
<seg id="2939">"in addition, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly is in danger already for many years."</seg>
<seg id="2940">"a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013, when he demonstrated violence against demonstrators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the inauguration of the elected president Mohamed Morsi."</seg>
<seg id="2941">"Shawkan waited, as more than 700 protesters, who had been arrested at the same incident, four years in prison for a trial date."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"recently, his trial was postponed to the 20th of May because, according to human rights groups, the prison management failed to bring the defendant from prison to the courtroom."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"Shawkan faces the death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups agree, pseudo-load of, among other things, weapons of possession, illegal gathering, murder and attempted murder."</seg>
