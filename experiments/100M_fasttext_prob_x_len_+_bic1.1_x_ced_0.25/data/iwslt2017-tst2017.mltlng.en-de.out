that is James Ris@@ en .
they might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times re@@ porter .
&quot; long before anyone heard of Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ul@@ arly that the N@@ SA illeg@@ ally listened to tel@@ eph@@ ones by Americans . &quot;
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
&quot; in this he describes a disa@@ strous U.S. intelligence operation , in which the CIA gave Iran literally blu@@ epr@@ ints for a nuclear bomb . &quot;
&quot; if that sounds crazy , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who didn &apos;t like the chapter ?
the US government .
&quot; for almost 10 years , the government has identified Ris@@ en and called upon him to name its alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this turn , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern of condem@@ ning whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and bes@@ etting journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish confidential information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not receive this information , and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave ones they reveal . &quot;
&quot; so when the government kno@@ cked on Ris@@ en , he did something that many brave re@@ porters did before him : he refused and said he would rather go to prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going to prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , although they have been claiming for years that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government have been dropped . &quot;
the reason : during the time of electronic monitoring the re@@ porters and sources can hide themselves less and less .
&quot; instead of failure and ris@@ king to make statements , it could also do its digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , have secretly ordered his phone calls , &quot;
&quot; just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and bank information , its credit exchange , and even travel documents with the list of his flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information , they found evidence they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ en &apos;s supposed source . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , but instead the judi@@ ci@@ ary condemned more than all U.S. governments in front of him . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as a secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article on national security has been the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower going to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is supposed to be protected by the first constitutional amend@@ ment because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all . &quot;
&quot; but just like the government &apos;s technology allowed to b@@ ypass the rights of re@@ porters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; they can do so from the moment they contact , rather than in retro@@ sp@@ ect , in the witness stand . &quot;
&quot; today there are communication software , which didn &apos;t exist yet , as Ris@@ en had written his book , and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls . &quot;
&quot; such technology is Secure@@ Drop , an open source trans@@ mitting system for whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation where I work . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an email , go to a news website , like the Washington Post Office . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload documents or send information , as with any usual contact form . &quot;
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access .
&quot; so the government can &apos;t find any more information secretly , and many of the information they would request would not be available from the outset . &quot;
&quot; Secure@@ Drop , however , is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new spy technologies that threaten us all . &quot;
&quot; it is important to us to ensure that not only technology experts , such as Edward Snow@@ den , have an opportunity to take offen@@ ders . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers , &quot;
&quot; or the next environmental colleague , the alarm for the contaminated water of Flin@@ t . or a Wall Street insi@@ der who warns us before the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot;
thank you .
&#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to reveal &#91; what does this mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; This week we were asked by news about a leak of 11 million documents of the Panama @-@ based law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers are going to companies such as Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . &quot;
&quot; we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works . &quot;
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s Prime Minister res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has mail@@ box companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; it is said that a track of $ 2 billion leads to Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin , about a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cell@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who wait nerv@@ ously for the next release , and on the next revealed documents . &quot;
now it sounds like the plot of an agent writer or a John Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
&quot; it seems we@@ eps away from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should that happen ?
&quot; but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not all pay their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads . &quot;
and that concerns us all .
&quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal . &quot;
&quot; throughout the world media and leading politicians , like secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens , will be used to hide and mask their wealth -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people seem to be very conf@@ using this whole world , and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work . &quot;
I always imagine it as a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
&quot; so one has a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what is important . &quot;
I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports in the USA about this matter .
&quot; presumably , because so far none of the prominent Americans reported this scandal . &quot;
now it &apos;s not that there are no rich Americans hiding their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; but by the principle , after which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has fewer American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we had a data leak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the US . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is true that in some U.S. countries it needs less information to provide less information to establish a company than to get a library card . &quot;
this type of transparency in the United States allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children .
sc@@ amm@@ ers are allowed to rip off particularly vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a hidden investig@@ ator into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
&quot; our investig@@ ator was an African Minister who wanted to bring a suspi@@ cious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
we really shocked us that all to a lawyer made suggestions to our investig@@ ator how he could transfer his money .
&quot; none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course no one was given money . but it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important not to consider this as individual cases .
it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator .
&quot; it is not about a single top politi@@ cian , involved in a scandal . &quot;
&quot; it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; and to cope with this , we have to change the rules of the game . &quot;
we need to change the rules to make this sort of behavior more difficult .
this may sound very clou@@ dy as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing had ever changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a borrow@@ ed optim@@ ist I see quite clearly that some things have started to change .
&quot; over the past few years , we have seen more transparency as regards the owners of companies . &quot;
the topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
&quot; since then , the EU has been collecting in central registers at national level , who really is behind firms in Europe and who controls them . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the United States hin@@ dered .
&quot; representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in the two parliamentary chambers , but this does not constitute the progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama revelations , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the United States and globally . &quot;
&quot; for us at Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for change . &quot;
we need ordinary people who become angry when they see other people can hide their true identity behind fake companies .
we need leaders in the economy who get up and say : &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot;
we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use laws to end this kind of in@@ transparency .
&quot; together we can finally end the in@@ transparency , which now allows this type of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot;
this is the story I almost ab@@ duc@@ ted and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da .
&quot; one day after I finished my design studies , I made a sales outlet . &quot;
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country . afterwards he would go to the cor@@ ps .
he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; where are you sleeping tonight ? &quot;
&quot; he made the whole thing worse , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and I thought , &quot; &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what am I doing now ? &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the cor@@ ps of peace , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans that . I don &apos;t want to be kidn@@ apped in the trunk of a Maz@@ das ! &quot;
this is a small boot !
then I heard : &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room .
&quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; Hey , how do you please ? &quot;
&quot; at night I lay in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; &quot; Oh man ! what did I rock there ? &quot;
a stranger sleeps in my living room .
what if he &apos;s crazy ?
&quot; I got such a fear that I got out of bed , embarrass@@ ed on toes to the door , and shut my bedroom door . &quot;
but he wasn &apos;t crazy at all .
we are still in touch .
&quot; the work of art that he had bought from me hangs today in his classroom . now , he is a teacher . &quot;
this was my first experience as a host . it completely changed my point of view .
perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered ?
&quot; when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s make a jump , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate runs out and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I believe creativity can create it to transform fear into fun .
&quot; I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could earn something . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ B a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep at us for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor .
they found it super and we too .
I am sure our cheese @-@ ham @-@ om@@ el@@ ets tasted completely different because we made them for our guests .
&quot; when we said goodbye to our last guest and the door to the castle fell , Brian and I star@@ ed at us . &quot;
did we just discover that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things came into the roll .
&quot; my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out if you could make a business concept out of it .
&quot; we presented the investors : &quot; &quot; we want to create a website where people publish public pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the type of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting . &quot;
on the Internet they can then invite wild people to stay with them .
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the rocket to ign@@ ite .
but they do not .
&quot; no one who is still in comfort , would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people . &quot;
why ?
because we as children have learned that strangers are dangerous .
&quot; if you have a problem , you can concentrate on the things you can do well . we were able to design . &quot;
at the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it &apos;s the overall experience .
&quot; we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who never met before . &quot;
can design do something like that ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a taste which degree we are striving for .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you &apos;re ready .
take your mobile phone into your hands .
now I &apos;d like to have you un@@ locked your mobile phone .
give your un@@ locked cell phone to your left seated neighbour .
this quiet flight of panic that you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked cell phone of a stranger in his hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
so also most guests feel if they stay elsewhere .
only for this reason can our company exist .
just so who is Al Gor@@ es mobile now ?
could you please tell Twitter that he is chann@@ eling for the President &apos;s office ?
you can now return the mobile phones .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I want to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail about this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbor had first presented with his name , when he tells us where he comes from , how his dog or his children are called ? &quot;
&quot; imagine you would have 150 assessments , all say , &quot; &quot; He can really hold very well locked cell phones ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
how would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well thought @-@ out feedback system boo@@ sts confidence decisi@@ vely .
at the beginning we have done some things wrong .
it was hard for people to give negative jud@@ gements .
&quot; in the end , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had submitted their assessments before we set them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how much they are about age and place of residence .
&quot; not surprisingly , we trust the people most that are most similar to us . &quot;
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social bias .
it becomes exciting when you add a person &apos;s call -- in our case through jud@@ gements .
&quot; if one has less than three assessments , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but if you have more than ten , everything changes . &quot;
a good reputation stands out for simil@@ arities .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
&quot; in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you buy from yourself . &quot;
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if you tell too little about it , such as &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you won &apos;t get an answer . &quot;
&quot; one tells us too much , as for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request is not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , for example &quot; &quot; Tol@@ le works of art in your home ! I am making holidays with my family . &quot;
how to create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics to write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces towards strangers .
what we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudi@@ ces .
here you can see how many people use our offer .
you can see three things .
&quot; first , unbeliev@@ ably good luck . &quot;
second : the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
&quot; third , a need that had not been met before . &quot;
&quot; for us , business is just very good . &quot;
of course there are times when not everything runs smoothly .
there were guests who celebrated un@@ authorised parties or devast@@ ated apartments .
hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain .
&quot; at the beginning of the project , I worked with the customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone . &quot;
I stood at the front of the front when trust was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I just think about it .
the disappointment that one hears in the voice of the call@@ ers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves .
&quot; fortunately , only a fraction of the 123 million booked nights had a problem . &quot;
for people trust each other rightly .
&quot; when trust works , won@@ dro@@ us works can arise . &quot;
one of our guests made a holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
perfect home for travelers who are prone to heart attacks due to sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
&quot; Ja@@ vier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels that save lives , even though they don &apos;t know one at all . &quot;
&quot; you drive in your own car to the hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot;
&quot; because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they pass books . &quot;
you can even stay longer without calcul@@ ating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
&quot; of course , not every stay is running . &quot;
but these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what one wants to achieve with the Share Economy .
&quot; when I first stum@@ bled over this term , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together ?
it is about economic trading .
&quot; but now simply to name the &quot; rental industry , &quot; the thing is not justified . &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people put a part of themselves openly and that changes everything .
&quot; if you travel nowadays , it is comparable to fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic . &quot;
but what if travelling would be a rich buffet from local impressions ?
&quot; what if in any place you visited , a group there would wait to complete a thorough re@@ filling and to show one at a bar @-@ tour quarter of which you have never heard before ; &quot;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would design apartments from the ground up to the other ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the thought of shared participation ?
I imagine cities that enable us to society and relationships instead of sol@@ itude and isol@@ ation@@ ism .
&quot; in South Korea &apos;s capital , Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking spaces that belonged to the government &quot;
have been offered to residents . students who were looking for a place to stay
&quot; were convey@@ ed to people whose children were moved out . incub@@ ators programs were started , &quot;
&quot; to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85@@ ,000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a foreign or even host . &quot;
so the idea doesn &apos;t seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us .
we didn &apos;t re@@ invent the wheel .
there was hospitality before .
there were similar websites before us .
so why has our work just worked ?
&quot; apart from happiness and timing , we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust . &quot;
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
&quot; I find it amazing , &quot;
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da goes past me .
&quot; we know , of course , that design cannot solve any problem . &quot;
&quot; but if it could help us , if it had this big impact , I wonder what we can use for design soon . &quot;
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or oppressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ? &quot;
or simply a delay in the security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I do not give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media are people who look like me .
a study found that 80 % of reporting about Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : Americans think most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra . &quot;
&quot; I am intro@@ ver@@ ted , &quot;
a Mö@@ cht@@ eg@@ ern fitness fan@@ atic
&quot; and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim . &quot;
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born this way . &quot;
I decided to do so .
&quot; when I was 17 , I decided to ou@@ ten myself . &quot;
&quot; no , not as a hom@@ osexual person , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . &quot;
my feminist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the funny thing was that at that time it was a declaration of independence for me , in contrast to the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old , to adapt myself to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal . &quot;
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I have strug@@ gled with the Koran .
&quot; I read it , thought , posed , doub@@ ted , and finally believed . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow dedication that deep@@ ened with every reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
&quot; did you ever feel that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , understands you completely , and yet somehow loves ? &quot;
that &apos;s how it feels .
&quot; later I got married and started , like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer . &quot;
&quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot; &quot;
then came the terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; breaking &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , air@@ planes flew into buildings , people jumped out of the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical mal@@ function ?
my shock turned rapidly into rebellion .
why should I do something like that ?
&quot; I changed the television channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... , &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... , ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot;
Oh my God .
&quot; it was not only my country attacked , but in the N@@ u the deeds of others turned me into a suspect . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to travel through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move to a new city and start post@@ graduate studies . &quot;
&quot; I remember how I was silent -- when we were silent -- so deep it went into my seat , and I was afraid to be recognized as a Muslim . &quot;
&quot; we moved into our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations , who said , &quot; Be vi@@ gil@@ ant , &quot; Be careful , &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Abi@@ de in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; S@@ ame not . &quot;
I stayed in@@ doors all week .
then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gathered to pray .
&quot; and again the warnings : &quot; &quot; don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot;
I looked at the extensive reporting .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered , and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people that were considered to be Muslims . &quot;
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
I have got rid of the anger of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain themselves .
&quot; I have nothing against questions , I love questions . &quot;
these are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; today , we can actually hear people say , &quot; There is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims . &quot;
when will we get rid of them ?
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my community as from a tumor in the body of the USA .
it is only the question : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a malign@@ ant tumour is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumour can only be observed under observation .
the alternatives are po@@ int@@ less because the question is fal@@ sely posed .
&quot; like all other Americans , Muslims are not a tumor in the body of the US , but a vital organ . &quot;
thank you !
&quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympic masks . &quot;
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America safer ?
&quot; there might be a few parking lots , but not stopping the terror . &quot;
regular visit of a mos@@ que leads to viewing people of other fai@@ ths tolerant and showing greater civi@@ c participation .
&quot; and as a leader of the police in the Washington D.@@ C. area recently said , people are actually not radi@@ cal@@ ised in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radi@@ cal@@ ised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
&quot; in the ra@@ dic@@ alization process , one has noticed that it begins online . first , the person is cut off from their community , even from their family , so that the extre@@ mis@@ m group can make a bra@@ in@@ washing , and anyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or of faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent ra@@ dic@@ alization , we must stop people to go to the mos@@ que . &quot;
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human , I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
but we would add to their imagination when one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam such as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x cl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology grounds on their &quot; holy book . &quot;
&quot; but if you take a look at them , they do not drive what they read in their &quot; Holy Scriptures . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into the scriptures .
an outstanding Ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she preten@@ ded to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said that the problem was exactly the opposite . every spiritual man , with whom she spoke , brought her to silence , and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring them into trouble . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing and something that would make sense to her anger , it was a major goal for the instrument@@ alization through extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised a solution . &quot;
this Ima@@ m restored the connection to God and her church .
&quot; instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed her constructive ways of real change in the world . &quot;
what she learned in the mos@@ que kept her from joining the IS .
this was an insight into how Islam@@ opho@@ bia concerns me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
&quot; how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ? &quot;
one study -- actually several neuro@@ logical studies -- show : if we fear we happen to pass at least three things .
&quot; we rather accept an author@@ itarian government system , con@@ formity and prejudi@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; a study reveals that when people submit messages in which negative about Muslims were reported , they were more likely to have military attacks on Muslim countries , as well as circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an academic problem .
&quot; when you look at when the mood against Muslims rose upward -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two election periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected .
it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
&quot; we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts us all . &quot;
&quot; when assign@@ ing collective guilt , it is not just about explaining oneself . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple living in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was an athlete .
&quot; he was talented at the dental faculty , talented , promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would say to me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person she knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; when did my brother become such an accomplished young man ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; just a few weeks after visiting Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , has murdered her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who had posted expressions against Muslims on his Facebook page . &quot;
he shot at De@@ ah eight times .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be im@@ moral but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or stay safe at home ?
&quot; we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about which America we wanted to leave our children : one that would control us by fear , or one in which we can freely exercise our religion . &quot;
we decided for the mos@@ que .
&quot; with our son in the child &apos;s seat , we drove silent , with high pressure to the mos@@ que . &quot;
&quot; I took it out , pulled out my shoes , went into the prayer hall , and what I saw let me stop . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the assembled people were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us . &quot;
at that moment I collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had the courage and compassion brought about panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe on number ?
or will you join those who mean : we are better than that .
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
&quot; Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so , D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve . &quot;
&quot; but I wonder what you say to those who might say that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker with drau@@ ght , working in a noble mind@@ set , so an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say you don &apos;t fool yourself . I &apos;m completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
&quot; when you look to Muslims around the world , and I did this with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims all over the world , people want normal things . &quot;
&quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
so I &apos;m in no way an exception .
&quot; if people seem like an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is just about becoming a billi@@ on@@ aire business .
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the potential applications for commercial dr@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; before air @-@ p@@ act formation penet@@ rated into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines at Fra@@ c Centre in France has built a six @-@ meter high tower of 1 500 bricks . some years ago , they began to fly with ropes . &quot;
&quot; by connecting to each other , air devices reach high speed and acceleration in confined spaces . &quot;
they can also build self @-@ resili@@ ent structures .
&quot; they have learned to carry loads , deal with tur@@ mo@@ il and generally react to natural laws . &quot;
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our aim is to cross the limits of possible in the autonomous flight .
&quot; in order for a system to operate autonom@@ ously , it must collectively know where in the room the mobile objects are located . &quot;
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
&quot; for today &apos;s demos , we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratory . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
&quot; each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine calculations on board what the machine should do . &quot;
&quot; external commands exist on the highest level e. g. &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; land &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a so @-@ called tail@@ starter , &quot;
an aircraft that tries to beat two flies with a flap .
&quot; like other Star@@ r@@ excur@@ sion@@ ists , it is efficient in advance , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all its variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most of the star wings , it can float , and therefore has great advantages at start and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a down@@ side . &quot;
a restriction of rear @-@ star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence such as wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flight unit doesn &apos;t matter in what position the optimum position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often ask ourselves basic abstract questions which advance at the core of the matter . &quot;
&quot; such a question would be , for example , what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ? &quot;
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
&quot; helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts , which gather to hurt you . &quot;
&quot; decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly remotely controlled aircraft that had only two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder . &quot;
&quot; recently , we discovered that flying is working with only one . &quot;
&quot; this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically simplest remote controlled aircraft . it was invented recently . &quot;
&quot; it has only one movable part , one prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and trans@@ verse ru@@ dder , no further actu@@ ators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , the inner life happens a lot so that it can fly stable and move everywhere in the room . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear @-@ star@@ ters . to bring it to fly , I have to throw it right . &quot;
&quot; the probability of throwing it right correctly , if all watch me is small , so I &apos;ll show you a video filmed last night . &quot;
&quot; if the Mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in pleasure , this machine is here , the Omni@@ Cop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all this super@@ abundance ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ ric .
therefore he is ambi@@ valent in his alignment .
&quot; by doing so , he will receive the extraordinary ability , &quot;
&quot; move in space in all directions , no matter which direction it is turned or even as it rot@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers . &quot;
&quot; some models can be seen in models , the rest is learned directly while flying . &quot;
let &apos;s see this .
&quot; if flying machines are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine consists of two separate two prop@@ eller aircraft .
it turns clock@@ wise
and the other anti @-@ clock@@ wise .
&quot; when you build them , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; but if something goes wrong -- an engine or prop@@ eller falls out , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly further , though limited . &quot;
we will now demonstrate this by making half fli@@ ght@@ less .
the last demonstration examines synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we accepted standard Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
&quot; each unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit . &quot;
hopefully you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine there would like to be a flying shade screen on Broadway .
of course it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology .
for types like us the salary is in development and the creative act .
&quot; it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and magical our universe is , and that it allows creative , smart creatures to shape them in such a spectacular way . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
&quot; approximately 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes cir@@ cl@@ ed each other in a very distant gal@@ axy , transforming the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second into pure energy . &quot;
&quot; for this short moment , they lit up bri@@ ghter than all stars in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the entire known universe . &quot;
it was a very big boy .
&quot; their energy , however , were not set free in the form of light -- &quot;
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into the space @-@ time structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us arrange events at first .
&quot; more than 1.3 billion years ago , multi @-@ cell life was created on Earth . &quot;
&quot; since then the earth has produced a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God stands at -- even the Internet . &quot;
&quot; approximately 25 years ago , a group of particularly courageous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from the MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , which arise about by col@@ li@@ ding black holes . &quot;
most of them thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognised them as crazy geni@@ uses so that the US National Science Foundation financed her idea .
&quot; after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work , they built the Det@@ ector Lig@@ o : the laser interfer@@ ometer gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ wave observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; in the following years , the precision of Lig@@ o increased significantly , which greatly improved detection performance . &quot;
this is why it is now called Advanced Lig@@ o .
&quot; in early September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor , persistent problems . &quot;
&quot; on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the commissioning of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes pushed through the earth . &quot;
you went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the farewell to my death @-@ sick father .
&quot; in essence , this was the fruits of my life . &quot;
&quot; AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been studying gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves from black holes and their through observ@@ atories , like lig@@ o @-@ measurable signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves ? &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a cra@@ mp@@ ing in the structure of space and time .
&quot; in passing the wave , the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and squee@@ zed into the other . &quot;
&quot; for illustr@@ ative purposes , lec@@ turers in courses on rel@@ ativity theory often lead a really sil@@ ly dance . &quot;
&quot; stretching and du@@ sting , stretching and du@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous . &quot;
&quot; on September 14 , for example , each of us was stretched and stretched at the arrival of the waves . the stretching of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; that is 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . &quot;
&quot; with a five @-@ kilometre laser detector , and this is already absurd , this length would have to be measured on less than a thous@@ and@@ th of a nucleus of a nucleus . that &apos;s grot@@ esque . &quot;
at the end of his classical text about gra@@ vit@@ ation
&quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the following : &quot; the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous . &quot;
&quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public , all obstacles will certainly be overcome . &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 and 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott loves to say that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wavel@@ ength , which is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your cell . &quot;
&quot; this is quite practical , because so you can create an image or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light around you from several points . &quot;
&quot; in terms of sounds , that is different . &quot;
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 metres .
&quot; that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you : &quot;
about the face of your child .
&quot; instead , we listen to certain properties like pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it . &quot;
&quot; now , just says Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob breaks them down . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; stupid Bob , &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot make simple pictures of objects in space with them .
&quot; but by paying attention to changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
&quot; so when we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the universe . &quot;
&quot; listening to the gra@@ vit@@ ation can tell us much about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a very long time . &quot;
&quot; SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , circular : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
&quot; turn the two bodies very quickly , you can hear the same chir@@ ping with an additional tone change . that sounds like : W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu ! &quot;
it is a kind of movement vocabulary that shapes into the wa@@ ve@@ form .
AA : on September 14th 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- heard Lig@@ o the following : &#91; sur@@ rendering noise &#93; Som@@ one who knows what he has to hear knows this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes each with 30 @-@ fold solar mass that revol@@ ves around as fast as the bars of your mixer .
AA : let us think about what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , cir@@ cling a hundred times per second before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we have heard it .
this consists of the permanent importance of Lig@@ o .
&quot; lig@@ o p@@ aves a completely new way to explore the universe , as it has never been possible before . &quot;
on this way we can listen to the All and hear the In@@ visible .
&quot; much in space , we can -- practically or basically -- not see . &quot;
&quot; a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in Super@@ nov@@ ae . &quot;
they are very useful . from them we have learned a lot about the universe .
&quot; but the exciting physical processes happen in the core that lies behind thousands of kilometres of iron , carbon and silicon . &quot;
we will never go through because these are opa@@ que .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them as the Big B@@ ang is covered by his own reflection . &quot;
&quot; with the help of gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , it should be possible to look back to the beginning . &quot;
&quot; and the most important thing : I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen , we will never see and of whom we have no idea . things that we only discover by listening . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Lig@@ o found things right in the first attempt that we didn &apos;t expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says on this subject : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , as Lig@@ o watches them , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient bodies of prehistoric times . the black holes are so to speak the Sau@@ ri@@ erk@@ no@@ chen for our archaeological work . &quot;
&quot; Lig@@ o gives us a completely different view of the events in space , the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we came out of this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge now is to be as bold as possible .
&quot; thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and chir@@ ping of the cosmos . &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the Big B@@ ang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
you dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tried out an experiment .
&quot; for a year , I would say &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; in front of which I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into uncomfortable situations , I forced myself to say &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
do I want to be live on TV ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to start playing ?
&quot; no , no , no , yes , yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : to do exactly what I feared , my fear eliminated . &quot;
&quot; my fear of keeping speeches , my social fear -- pu@@ ff , away . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; has changed my life .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
&quot; but there was a definite yes , which changed my life deeply , to an unexpected . it started with a matter of my little ones . &quot;
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . &quot;
as if she had a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I need milk for my be@@ ak @-@ cup . &quot;
&quot; she once asked her if I could play with her when I was just on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
this yes was the beginning
&quot; from that point on , I always tried to play with them as soon as you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing , or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am very tired . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , on my children , to our family . &quot;
but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently I fully understood that the &quot; yes &quot; say to play with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am a writer . I think things like that you are contempl@@ ating life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I scre@@ amed TV . I &apos;m producing television .
&quot; I make television , in a great style . &quot;
in this TV season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program in the world .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production . &quot;
every show has hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
&quot; a new episode every nine days , four shows , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three programmes at the same time : 24 episodes : show To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV , &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
&quot; in America , my television series runs one after the other on Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; all over the world , my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers . &quot;
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts that I have created and not only produced , so on top . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather around my fans around bon@@ fires and tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four television series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires burning around the world . &quot;
do you know who is doing that ?
&quot; no one , therefore I am a Titan . &quot;
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with this .
I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
&quot; I &apos;m telling you that all of you who work so hard , whether you &apos;re running a company , a country or a classroom , a business or household , take me seriously , and it &apos;s true when I say : I understand that it &apos;s not about dre@@ aming in a dream job . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work a lot , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I am immersed in the work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
&quot; it is as if I set up troops , when I painted on a screen . &quot;
&quot; as a portrait of a high sound , a marathon should be delivered . &quot;
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; she is creative , mechanical , stren@@ uous and intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and reasonable . and the best part is the sum . &quot;
there is such a change in me when the work is going well .
&quot; a bu@@ zz starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz@@ ing sounds like a busy street , I could drive for ever on it . &quot;
&quot; many people assume , when I explain to them the sums that I am talking about writing that writing gives me joy . &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t understand me wrong , it does . &quot;
&quot; but the bu@@ zz@@ ing -- when I began working and working with television production when I started working and working , building , creating , and working together , I discovered this thing , this bu@@ zz , this energy . &quot;
the sum is more than writing .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing is action and activity . the sum is a drug .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing is music . the bu@@ zz@@ ing is light and air .
the sum is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a sum , you can not strive for size . &quot;
&quot; feeling not to be different than aiming for size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called the bu@@ zz@@ ing .
or perhaps it means being a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic .
perhaps genius is called genius .
perhaps it is ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; I know only that I am not made for failure , and I know only that I love the sum . &quot;
&quot; I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it . &quot;
&quot; the more work there are , the more things work at the same time , the more things are happening , the more I write history , the more expectations there are . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; the land I created , the marathon I run , the army , the screen , the high sound , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz@@ ing . &quot;
I like this sum . I love the sum .
I need the sum . I am the sum .
am I just this bu@@ zz ?
and then the bu@@ zz@@ ing stopped .
&quot; over@@ hau@@ led , over@@ loaded , over@@ hau@@ led , burned out . &quot;
the bu@@ zz@@ ing stopped .
now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their m@@ um is a single stit@@ ch .
&quot; Har@@ per tells people , &quot; My mo@@ m won &apos;t be there , but you can write to my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; and Emer@@ son says , &quot; &quot; Well , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da @-@ Land . &quot;
they are the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are baby tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the bu@@ zz@@ ing ceased . &quot;
the bu@@ zz@@ ing of the engine was silent .
I didn &apos;t love my job any more . the engine was out .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing did not come back .
my h@@ um was broken .
&quot; I made the same things as usual : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , working weekends , no regre@@ ts , nothing deleg@@ ating , a Titan doesn &apos;t sleep , doesn &apos;t give up , with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no sum .
in me was silence .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
&quot; I was a show @-@ Titan , &quot;
&quot; everything was grey , I just had no fun . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the bu@@ zz@@ ing and the bu@@ zz@@ ing I was .
so what do you do if what you do is suddenly fade out of the work you love ?
&quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; bew@@ are , stupid author @-@ Titan . &quot;
&quot; but you know you &apos;re doing it , you &apos;re working , you &apos;re a teacher , a ban@@ ker , a m@@ um , a painter , Bill Gates , one loves to be a painter , a ban@@ ker , a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , and knows how to stop bu@@ zz@@ ing when the bu@@ zz@@ ing stops , who is one then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; if the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ? &quot;
and then my &quot; southern state wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; asks me a question .
&quot; I &apos;m on the way to the outside , late and she says : &quot; &quot; mother , do you like to play ? &quot;
and I want to say no when two things become aware of me :
&quot; first , I must say yes to everything and secondly , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; &quot; pussy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she doesn &apos;t call anyone &quot; &quot; pussy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when did that happen ?
&quot; I miss it when I &apos;m Titan and my sum@@ ming is smo@@ other , and everything changes in front of my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says : &quot; &quot; mother , do you like to play ? &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about it .
&quot; we play and her sisters b@@ ump us , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , in the lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of sum@@ ming , I can &apos;t do anything except to watch out . &quot;
I am focused .
I am silent .
&quot; the country I created , the marathon I run , the army , the screen , the high sound - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and wet kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wa@@ xing pen@@ cils and the song in which it is about letting go , or whatever the girl get in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot; &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so short that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me sol@@ ves .
a mental door enters and an energy boost comes in .
&quot; and that doesn &apos;t happen immediately , but it happens , it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the bu@@ zz is coming back slowly .
&quot; no full volume , barely there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there . &quot;
&quot; not the bu@@ zz@@ ing , but a bu@@ zz . &quot;
and now I feel like I know a magical secret .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
&quot; the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the hum@@ ming , the titanium um@@ ming , that is only the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are when I tell you who I am , when I describe myself with the help of broad@@ casts and TV lessons and how function@@ ally my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum is . &quot;
the sum is not a force and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it depends on joy .
the real sum depends on the love .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing is the stream that comes from the lust of life .
the real sum is self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; the real bu@@ zz@@ ing ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , the expectation and the pressure . &quot;
the real h@@ um is simple and original .
&quot; the real sum is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered the wrong words to me , because what God told me that I am a Titan ? &quot;
it is just love .
&quot; we all need a little more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
&quot; I do this as a rule , so that I can free myself from any guilt as a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic . &quot;
&quot; it is law , I have no choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the sum@@ ming again . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
playing is not easy for me how to work .
&quot; the truth hur@@ ts , &quot;
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer to work at the workplace as at home .
&quot; this admission is painful , because what a person prefers to work than to be home ? &quot;
&quot; well , I . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I call myself &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; -- &quot;
I have to have problems .
none of it is that I am too relaxed .
&quot; we rush around in the garden , before and back , back and forth . &quot;
&quot; we make small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bubbles .
&quot; I mainly feel stiff , absent and confused . &quot;
I always take my mobile phone .
but it is ok .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the sum of the universe fills me . &quot;
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can also say yes if your child wants to play with you .
&quot; perhaps you consider me nai@@ ve , for a day@@ dream . &quot;
&quot; you &apos;re right , but you can do it too ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? they &apos;re not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
&quot; my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes , until they think they want to do something else . &quot;
&quot; they are wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes a Mari@@ enk@@ ä@@ fer or bis@@ cuit replaces me .
&quot; and talk to my teen@@ ie @-@ daughter for a whole 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; there are only 15 minutes , more do not need . &quot;
&quot; everyone can bring about 15 minutes a day , even on a bad mood day ! &quot;
15 minutes a day !
&quot; no mobile phone , no laundry , no distra@@ ction . &quot;
&quot; the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to pray . &quot;
but 15 minutes are inside !
&quot; my children are my welfare , my world . they don &apos;t have to be the children . it is necessary to feel the bu@@ zz , to have a place for peace of mind . &quot;
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about pleasure .
&quot; in order to &quot; &quot; play &quot; &quot; in general . &quot;
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what is good for you .
find it out and keep it .
&quot; I &apos;m not perfect in that . I &apos;ll reti@@ re and I will be victorious . meet friends , read books , enjoy the day -- &quot;
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in training , when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot;
15 minutes a bit - why not treat yourself to full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong about it ? nothing !
the bu@@ zz@@ ing came back in my spare time . the bu@@ zz@@ ing seems to return when I don &apos;t work .
working does not work without games .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul . &quot;
&quot; I like the bu@@ zz@@ ing , but I don &apos;t love it . &quot;
I don &apos;t need it .
&quot; I am not the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz is not me ... no more . &quot;
&quot; soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is my sum .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing of life .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing of love .
&quot; the sum of the work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so grateful for that . &quot;
it &apos;s snow@@ y to me that I &apos;m a Titan . I have never seen a Titan who wants to travel to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still working . my camp@@ fire is still burning .
&quot; the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the clearer my head . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the sum . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more this unusual , lasting , bare and new feeling of life in me is wide . less Titan -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel exactly this sum , the more I know who I am . &quot;
I am a writer . I think things like that . I am considering you life .
&quot; this is part of the job , which means living his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
because a dream job should be a bit dre@@ amy .
&quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot;
Tit@@ ans don &apos;t have a chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to another after a serious stroke or after a car accident .
&quot; for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very small ability for self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a severe injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a lasting , severe disability . &quot;
this is probably the reason why I became a functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical measures .
&quot; they certainly have heard of one of the most well @-@ known , the &quot; &quot; deep brain stimulation &quot; . &quot; in doing so one im@@ planted an electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the circuits of the neur@@ ons in such a way as to improve the neuro@@ logical function . &quot;
it is truly an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease that suffered from severe trem@@ bling and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation however does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close .
&quot; with some help , the brain can help itself . &quot;
history began 15 years ago .
&quot; at that time , I was a senior doctor and worked in the emergency room for day and night . &quot;
often I supplied patients with skull @-@ brain trauma .
&quot; you must imagine that with skull @-@ brain trauma , the brain sw@@ ells and the cran@@ ial pressure increases . &quot;
&quot; in order to save life , it is necessary to reduce the pressure of the skull . &quot;
&quot; for this , sometimes you have to remove some s@@ wollen brain mass . &quot;
&quot; instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues . &quot;
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to let cells grow from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
letting cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families .
&quot; you have to find proper nutrition , temperature , humidity and environments to thri@@ ve . &quot;
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
&quot; after many attempts , Jean @-@ François managed to win . &quot;
he saw that under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , which are surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells . &quot;
&quot; perhaps you still know from the biology lesson that stem cells are im@@ mature cells , which can turn into any cell type of the organism . &quot;
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to get this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operation .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast .
they never die ; they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they spread slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently . &quot;
we needed long to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our brain @-@ tex @-@ cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
&quot; at the stage of the fet@@ us , they are responsible for the folding of the brain . &quot;
but why do they stay ?
we don &apos;t know that .
&quot; we believe that they are taking part in the healing of the brain , as we find them close to brain injuries in higher concentrations . &quot;
but this is not so secure .
but one thing is clear -- from these cells we got our stem cells .
we stand in front of a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
&quot; we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ linguistic area , and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did . &quot;
and then mark them in color in order to be able to follow them in the brain .
&quot; in the last step , we reim@@ planted them at the outlet point of the same individual . &quot;
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- Aut@@ otran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we integrate these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we reim@@ port the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
&quot; thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ il@@ ler , we were able to work with apes . &quot;
&quot; in the first scenario we introduced the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they had been removed again , they go back home . &quot;
in the second scenario we added an injury to and reim@@ plant@@ ate exactly the same cells and now cells remained -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been reim@@ ported .
&quot; the evidence they show are these small points . these are the cells we dy@@ e in vitro , in culture . &quot;
&quot; of course , we couldn &apos;t stop here . &quot;
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take food pellets from one tray .
they made it very good .
&quot; when they had achieved a stable skill level , we injured the motor @-@ motor @-@ motor area in the motor @-@ driven cor@@ tex . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could not move their hand any more . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen with people , they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree , just like after a stroke . &quot;
&quot; patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to some degree , just like the monkeys . &quot;
&quot; when we were certain that the monkey had reached its level of spontaneous recovery , we implant his own cells . &quot;
&quot; on the left side , they see the monkeys that spontaneously recovered . &quot;
it can produce about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
&quot; now , when we reim@@ port the cells , see the same monkey , two months after the implant@@ ation . &quot;
I can tell you that this was very exciting for us as well .
&quot; since that time , we have found out a lot more about these cells . &quot;
we can freeze it and use it later .
&quot; we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
but our dream is still to implant them in humans .
I really hope that I will soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
&quot; Bruno Giussani : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who needs that . &quot;
I definitely do .
&quot; of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials . &quot;
Jo@@ cel@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . based on these great results you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this kind of studies .
&quot; BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes until someone can come to the hospital , and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial . &quot;
will the authority allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
&quot; it takes a long time to choose the patients , perform the treatments and evaluate if it is useful to do this kind of treatment . &quot;
&quot; after that , you have to apply this to a multi @-@ center study . &quot;
first you have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
&quot; BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course . &quot;
&quot; BG : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it . &quot;
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as self @-@ evident .
&quot; we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality , but as an inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to look at it as an imm@@ utable fact .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew of Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is perfectly possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
&quot; in fact , democracy is f@@ ading away in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- I was un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally clari@@ fied as Minister of Finance in the Euro@@ group , that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- should not influence the austerity programmes implemented in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at this moment , I thought there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my so@@ aked friends who repeatedly said that democracy would be abol@@ ished if it would change anything . &quot;
at this point I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy .
&quot; I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China , and even the Euro@@ group have er@@ ased a mistake , we could save democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ en@@ cel@@ ess democracy . &quot;
&quot; without democracy our societies will be bri@@ ghter , our future glo@@ omy and our great new technologies are wasted . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of waste , I would like to point out an interesting contradiction which currently threat@@ ens our economies . &quot;
&quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; twin peaks &quot; &quot; parad@@ ox . &quot;
&quot; you know and recognize him as the debt mountain , who th@@ rows his long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all recognize the debt mountain , &quot;
but few recognize his twin .
&quot; a mountain of unused cash , which belongs to the wealthy savers and corporations , who , however , are too anxious to invest there where it would be productive and to produce income with which one could contribute to the debt mountain and also to produce all the things that humanity needs , such as &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; over the past 3 months , in the United States , in England and in the euro area , 3,@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars have been invested in all the wealth producing goods such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so forth . &quot;
&quot; 3.@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollar sounds like a lot of money , until one compar@@ es it with the 5.@@ 1 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollar , which at the same time were lying around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing , except to infl@@ ate the stock markets and raise the real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; thus , debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks that are not equ@@ ated by the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the USA , Japan and Europe unemployed , and consequently a low macro@@ economic demand , which , as in a continuous loop , encourages the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors that would be true that his son would kill him when he is grown up , &quot;
un@@ intentionally causes the circumstances causing Ö@@ di@@ pus to kill him .
that is my Ha@@ ders with Cap@@ ital@@ ism --
&quot; his very wast@@ eful art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents , and especially finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial for saving the earth . &quot;
is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue : what do we understand under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the social form in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority .
&quot; the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy , of course , closed too many -- &quot;
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
but it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy due to these exclu@@ sions .
&quot; the decision at the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it with@@ drew the working poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive that they grant them the right to political co @-@ determination with the same tendency to vote in questions of the state &apos;s concerns . &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy did not last long --
&quot; like a candle , which shines very bright , it is burnt out quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , today &apos;s liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies did not have their roots in ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious Revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American Constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which was ultimately a stat@@ ute for rulers . &quot;
&quot; the liberal democracy did not come until a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- i.e. the world of corporations -- became a democracy @-@ free zone . &quot;
&quot; in today &apos;s demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time that this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two is taking place , while the economy gradually under@@ mines politics and dis@@ ma@@ ges them . &quot;
wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not on a degeneration of their DNA .
it is because today it is possible to be in the government and still not in power because the power of politics is mig@@ rated into the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my hair with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it is about like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es that sustain@@ ably dec@@ im@@ ated the animals from which they feed themselves , that they end up star@@ ving at the end . &quot;
&quot; the power of the corporations is growing , political goods are depreci@@ ated , political goods are depreci@@ ated , the inequality rises , the general economic demand falls and the general managers of the corporations are too frigh@@ tened to invest the cash of their companies . &quot;
&quot; the more successful capitalism sells the &quot; dem@@ os &quot; from democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour @-@ power and the prosperity of mankind . &quot;
&quot; if that is true , it is obvious that we have to bring together politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demo &quot; retains control , just as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
&quot; this , by the way , is not a new idea . &quot;
the Marxist Left had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good .
the doctrine of the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain their position as in ancient Athens without creating new forms of brut@@ ality and extravag@@ ance .
but there is one solution : to abol@@ ish the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers with automation and robots .
&quot; the problem is that so long economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin peaks higher , the waste is more sub@@ lime , and the social conflicts deeper , as it is -- already very soon , as I believe -- will come in countries like China . &quot;
&quot; thus we need to re@@ design the economy and re@@ unite the spheres of economy and politics , and make sure that we are democr@@ ati@@ zing the re @-@ unified field , otherwise we end in a disease @-@ like surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cracy , which makes the film &quot; Matrix &quot; appear as a documentation . &quot;
&quot; the question is , therefore , not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has produced -- &quot;
&quot; the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to that in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; in which machines serve human beings , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long conversations with the meaning of life . &quot;
I think we must be optimistic .
&quot; so what would it be like to have this &quot; &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia rather than the &quot; &quot; Matrix &quot; &quot; similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot;
&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples . &quot;
&quot; in the area of companies : please introduce a capital market where you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from one job to the next , from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter in which you are working -- is the property of those currently working in the company . &quot;
then all income from capital and from rede@@ em@@ ing and the concept of wage labour is completely obsol@@ ete .
&quot; no distinction between those who belong to the companies , but they do not work therein , and employees who work there that the company does not belong to . no more exchange between capital and labour , no gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no up@@ lifting twin peaks . &quot;
&quot; in the area of global political economy : please introduce yourself briefly that our national currencies would have a vac@@ ill@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interests of all humanity . &quot;
&quot; imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the country into a mutual fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in green technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are ra@@ r . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference in 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
&quot; today , we have them , especially against the background of a re@@ unified policy and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world I describe to you is at the same time a liberal party in which it prefers privileged people , and Marxist because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the rub@@ b@@ ish of history , and Key@@ n@@ esian , global Key@@ n@@ esian . &quot;
&quot; but above all else , it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy . &quot;
will we aw@@ aken in such a world
or will we sink into a matrix - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands and we do it more democratic .
thank you .
Bruno Giussani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as a liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... do we not do this , technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers describes as a &quot; long term stagn@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; by transferring this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next , as we experience it , it will dest@@ abili@@ ze not only our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is true , then Marx is quite relevant , &quot;
&quot; just like Ha@@ ye@@ k , that &apos;s why I am a liberal Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I am totally mad . &quot;
&quot; BG : in fact , and now we are well . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if you &apos;re not working , you don &apos;t think enough . &quot;
BG : this is a very Greek one kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said this . BG : in your speech you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers you have clearly stated what you are holding from the West &apos;s point of view .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a huge measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the appearance of a democracy .
&quot; as I said in my speech , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of it plays -- the area of economics -- is a fully democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in a certain sense , if I can say so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China today resembles the England of the 19th century . &quot;
remember -- we tend to combine liber@@ alism with democracy -- that &apos;s a mistake historically regarded .
&quot; liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , as John Stu@@ art Mill -- &quot;
it was particularly scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
&quot; what we can see now in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; to blame China now , to do what the West has done in the 19th century , smells like hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I thought that &apos;s coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later in the first half of the year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ appo@@ inting as we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the euro@@ zone , &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; to say good @-@ bye to ourselves , and the permanent denial that a massive de@@ duction line passed through the euro@@ zone , and continues to be massi@@ vely threatened by the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which , by the way , was the first proposal that revealed this denial -- &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , within the Euro zone , the powers within the euro@@ zone have still voted for denial . &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; if you try to get an economic system that is not viable to live by political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , you might delay it for a while , but if the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive . &quot;
BG : which changes do you anticipate ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Seri@@ ously ...
&quot; if there is a finance minister or any minister who has been in office after 6 months , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he has no mistake , then this is a dangerous person . &quot;
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt program at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest in the financi@@ ers &apos; pages to find a common solution .
but there was no such thing .
&quot; they just wanted to bring our government down , just because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the distor@@ tions that ran through the euro@@ zone . &quot;
they didn &apos;t want to admit that for five years they had been carrying out a disa@@ strous program in Greece .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
it is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; none of the Troika &apos;s credi@@ tors , who imposed this policy on us , conf@@ essed : &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot;
my biggest fear is that the euro@@ zone is not out@@ lived .
&quot; if they do not survive , the free fighters will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; if we allow ourselves to take the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , according to which it seems to me , it will also be detri@@ mental to the future of Europeans as well as non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope you &apos;re wrong at this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you for being at TED . &quot;
Y@@ V : thank you .
&quot; most of them have never heard of Roy Price , although he is probably responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 . &quot;
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for very many of you .
this goes back to the decision that Roy hit three years ago .
Roy Price is a senior employee at Amazon Studio .
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a hed@@ geho@@ g hair@@ style and describes itself on Twitter as &quot; Mo@@ vies , TV , Technology , Tac@@ os . &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
&quot; of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought industry . &quot;
there are so many TV shows that Roy does not have any choice .
&quot; he has to find shows , which are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he has to find shows that are on the right hand corner of this curve . &quot;
this curve is the assessment of over 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the level shows how many shows will receive this review .
&quot; if your show is valued at nine and above , it is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows like &quot; Bre@@ aking Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ tive , where , after watching a relay , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left hand side , here at this end , shows like &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve . &quot;
Roy Price doesn &apos;t worry about getting on the left side of the curve because I think you need special intelligence to enter@@ tain &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
&quot; he makes more thoughts about the middle charge , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t inspire . &quot;
so he must make sure he is really on the right side .
&quot; the print is available , and of course it &apos;s the first time Amazon is doing so , so Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything . &quot;
he wants to create successes .
&quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he keeps a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes a lot of ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation , then he will produce the first episode of each of these shows and makes them online where they can watch them for free . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon publishes stuff for free , is it possible to access correctly ? &quot;
millions of viewers watch these episodes .
&quot; however , they do not know they will be watched while watching these shows . &quot;
they are watched by Roy and his team who are recording everything .
&quot; you can record when to start the show , when you pause , which parts you can jump over or over again . &quot;
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce with these data .
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com via four Repub@@ lican U.S. sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t that good . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House is 7.5 -- so something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for the programming of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find them a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a bit different . &quot;
&quot; instead of hosting a competition , he and his team looked at the available data on the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews they give to the shows whose course they like etc . &quot;
&quot; then they use this data to find out these little details about the spectators : what shows they like , what producers , what actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the parts together , they entered a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com about four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
&quot; of course , the question is : what happened here ? &quot;
&quot; there are two very competitive , data sealed companies . &quot;
&quot; they connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company . &quot;
what is the reason for this ?
because the logic somehow implies that it should work with everything .
&quot; if you collect millions of data for a decision you meet , you should make a good decision . &quot;
you have 200 years of statistics as a back @-@ up .
it is optimized by very powerful computers .
&quot; the least thing you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis does not work so , this is something frigh@@ tening , because we live in a time where we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television . &quot;
does anybody know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
&quot; no one . OK , that &apos;s even good . &quot;
multi @-@ health system is a software company and I hope that no one in this room will ever come into contact with this software . come into contact with it you are in jail .
&quot; if someone is in prison here and asks for dis@@ miss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge occurs or not . &quot;
&quot; just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , in spite of the many data , &quot;
not always the best results are produced . this is not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
the data of the most experienced companies is also wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that by data analysis they can predict break@@ outs of flu , the bad way -- by data analysis of Google searches . &quot;
it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . the success culmin@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked flaw@@ lessly , year around year until suddenly it didn &apos;t work anymore , &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; it just didn &apos;t work , this was again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data of the most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; despite all these errors , data streams increasingly in decisions of life -- at the workplace , in law enforcement , in medicine . &quot;
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I also know a lot of difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ aided genetics -- an area where some very smart people uni@@ mag@@ inable lots of data to make serious decisions such as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
&quot; you have to solve a complex problem , mainly two things : &quot;
&quot; first , put this problem into its individual parts so that you can analyze the individual parts ; as a branch , put the items together again to create a decision . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again . &quot;
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful they can only help to disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all have it : our brain .
&quot; if there is something in which the brain is good , it is possible to assemble parts and pieces , even if the information is incomplete , in order to gain a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and minds , where they also belong to the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise have not been able to . but the decision how to put all these parts together again and make a show like &quot; House of Cards , &quot; that was not in the data . &quot;
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show which meant that they took a big personal risk with this decision .
&quot; on the other hand , Amazon did this in the wrong way . &quot;
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first when competing for TV ideas , then they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show . &quot;
&quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say , &quot; &quot; They tell us the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data are helpful for better decisions , but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just one tool , and in order not to forget it , this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will ...
&quot; before there was data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a ja@@ - or no @-@ question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- right here at this moment .
I will make it out later with a technology demo .
&quot; I have made some decisions in my life so far , whereby I should have listened to the ball afterwards . &quot;
&quot; but , as you naturally know , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them with a much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the basic structure .
&quot; in the end , it is up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as very encouraging news that , despite the large amount of data , it still pays off to make decisions , to be an expert in what you are doing and taking risks . &quot;
&quot; in the end , it is not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thank you very much .
