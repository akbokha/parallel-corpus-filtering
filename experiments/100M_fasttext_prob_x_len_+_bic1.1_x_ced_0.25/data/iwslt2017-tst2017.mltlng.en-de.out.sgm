<seg id="1">That is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">They might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before anyone heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA illegally listened to telephones by Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in this he describes a disastrous U.S. intelligence operation, in which the CIA gave Iran literally blueprints for a nuclear bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if that sounds crazy, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who didn't like the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for almost 10 years, the government has identified Risen and called upon him to name its alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this turn, he became a symbol of the government's pattern of condemning whistleblowers and besetting journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish confidential information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not receive this information, and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave ones they reveal."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government knocked on Risen, he did something that many brave reporters did before him: he refused and said he would rather go to prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going to prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, although they have been claiming for years that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government have been dropped."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: during the time of electronic monitoring the reporters and sources can hide themselves less and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of failure and risking to make statements, it could also do its digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so the investigators, without his consent, have secretly ordered his phone calls,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"just like his e-mail data, financial and bank information, its credit exchange, and even travel documents with the list of his flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information, they found evidence they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and Risen's supposed source."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama promised to protect whistleblowers, but instead the judiciary condemned more than all U.S. governments in front of him."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of its work as a secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, almost every article on national security has been the result of a whistleblower going to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so we put the press work on the game, which is supposed to be protected by the first constitutional amendment because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just like the government's technology allowed to bypass the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"they can do so from the moment they contact, rather than in retrospect, in the witness stand."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today there are communication software, which didn't exist yet, as Risen had written his book, and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such technology is SecureDrop, an open source transmitting system for whistleblowers, originally developed by the Internet-famous Aaron Swartz, and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation where I work."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an email, go to a news website, like the Washington Post Office."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can upload documents or send information, as with any usual contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government can't find any more information secretly, and many of the information they would request would not be available from the outset."</seg>
<seg id="36">"SecureDrop, however, is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century."</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new spy technologies that threaten us all."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is important to us to ensure that not only technology experts, such as Edward Snowden, have an opportunity to take offenders. it is just as important that we protect the next whistle-blowers,"</seg>
<seg id="39">"or the next environmental colleague, the alarm for the contaminated water of Flint. or a Wall Street insider who warns us before the next financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness to reveal [what does this mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] This week we were asked by news about a leak of 11 million documents of the Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers are going to companies such as Mossack Fonseca and say:" okay, we need an anonymous company. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see the e-mails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's Prime Minister resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has mailbox companies in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is said that a track of $2 billion leads to Russia's President Vladimir Putin, about a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who wait nervously for the next release, and on the next revealed documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the plot of an agent writer or a John Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems weeps away from you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should that happen?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not all pay their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads."</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"throughout the world media and leading politicians, like secret tax havens, will be used to hide and mask their wealth -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people seem to be very confusing this whole world, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it as a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so one has a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what is important."</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports in the USA about this matter.</seg>
<seg id="63">"presumably, because so far none of the prominent Americans reported this scandal."</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it's not that there are no rich Americans hiding their fortunes in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">"but by the principle, after which these tax havens work, Mossack Fonseca has fewer American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the US."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, it is true that in some U.S. countries it needs less information to provide less information to establish a company than to get a library card."</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of transparency in the United States allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">Scammers are allowed to rip off particularly vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a hidden investigator into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigator was an African Minister who wanted to bring a suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked us that all to a lawyer made suggestions to our investigator how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">"none of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course no one was given money. but it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our covert investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">"it is not about a single top politician, involved in a scandal."</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and to cope with this, we have to change the rules of the game."</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this sort of behavior more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound very cloudy as if we could not do anything about it; as if nothing had ever changed; as if there will always be the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a borrowed optimist I see quite clearly that some things have started to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"over the past few years, we have seen more transparency as regards the owners of companies."</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU has been collecting in central registers at national level, who really is behind firms in Europe and who controls them."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the United States hindered.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in the two parliamentary chambers, but this does not constitute the progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the United States and globally."</seg>
<seg id="91">"for us at Global Witness, this is a moment for change."</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who become angry when they see other people can hide their true identity behind fake companies.</seg>
<seg id="93">We need leaders in the economy who get up and say: "transparency is not good for business."</seg>
<seg id="94">We need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use laws to end this kind of intransparency.</seg>
<seg id="95">"together we can finally end the intransparency, which now allows this type of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story I almost abducted and landed in the trunk of a red Mazda.</seg>
<seg id="97">"one day after I finished my design studies, I made a sales outlet."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country. afterwards he would go to the corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">He told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "where are you sleeping tonight?"</seg>
<seg id="104">"he made the whole thing worse," "I don't know yet." ""</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought," "Oh, man!"</seg>
<seg id="106">What am I doing now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who doesn't know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just got to know him! he says he would go to the corps of peace, but I don't know if he really plans that. I don't want to be kidnapped in the trunk of a Mazdas!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small boot!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard: "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="112">"a voice in my head said," "Hey, how do you please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night I lay in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought," "Oh man! what did I rock there?"</seg>
<seg id="114">A stranger sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he's crazy?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such a fear that I got out of bed, embarrassed on toes to the door, and shut my bedroom door."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he wasn't crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">"the work of art that he had bought from me hangs today in his classroom. now, he is a teacher."</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it completely changed my point of view.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">"when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress."</seg>
<seg id="123">"let's make a jump, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I'm unemployed, almost broke, my roommate runs out and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I believe creativity can create it to transform fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky:" Brian, I thought about how we could earn something. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded so "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRB aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep at us for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I am sure our cheese-ham-omelets tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">"when we said goodbye to our last guest and the door to the castle fell, Brian and I stared at us."</seg>
<seg id="134">Did we just discover that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came into the roll.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if you could make a business concept out of it.</seg>
<seg id="138">"we presented the investors:" "we want to create a website where people publish public pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the type of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting."</seg>
<seg id="139">On the Internet they can then invite wild people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the rocket to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">"no one who is still in comfort, would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we as children have learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if you have a problem, you can concentrate on the things you can do well. we were able to design."</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it's the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">"we had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, between people who never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design do something like that?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a taste which degree we are striving for.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you're ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hands.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I'd like to have you unlocked your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your unlocked cell phone to your left seated neighbour.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet flight of panic that you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">The only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked cell phone of a stranger in his hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So also most guests feel if they stay elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason can our company exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just so who is Al Gores mobile now?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please tell Twitter that he is channeling for the President's office?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I want to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail about this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbor had first presented with his name, when he tells us where he comes from, how his dog or his children are called?"</seg>
<seg id="170">"imagine you would have 150 assessments, all say," "He can really hold very well locked cell phones!" ""</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well thought-out feedback system boosts confidence decisively.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we have done some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to give negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">"in the end, we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had submitted their assessments before we set them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how much they are about age and place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">"not surprisingly, we trust the people most that are most similar to us."</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It becomes exciting when you add a person's call -- in our case through judgements.</seg>
<seg id="182">"if one has less than three assessments, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but if you have more than ten, everything changes."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation stands out for similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">"in addition, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you buy from yourself."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if you tell too little about it, such as" Hi!, "you won't get an answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"one tells us too much, as for example:" I have problems with my mother "-- -- the request is not accepted."</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal degree of openness, for example" "Tolle works of art in your home! I am making holidays with my family."</seg>
<seg id="191">How to create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices towards strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people use our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">"first, unbelievably good luck."</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">"third, a need that had not been met before."</seg>
<seg id="200">"for us, business is just very good."</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not everything runs smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who celebrated unauthorised parties or devastated apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">"at the beginning of the project, I worked with the customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone."</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front of the front when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts when I just think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that one hears in the voice of the callers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, only a fraction of the 123 million booked nights had a problem."</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trust each other rightly.</seg>
<seg id="210">"when trust works, wondrous works can arise."</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made a holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">Perfect home for travelers who are prone to heart attacks due to sitting activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">"Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels that save lives, even though they don't know one at all."</seg>
<seg id="218">"you drive in your own car to the hospital, when you die, and wait while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they don't want you to feel lonely, they pass books."</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">"of course, not every stay is running."</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what one wants to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I first stumbled over this term, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is about economic trading.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but now simply to name the" rental industry, "the thing is not justified."</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People put a part of themselves openly and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">"if you travel nowadays, it is comparable to fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">But what if travelling would be a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">"what if in any place you visited, a group there would wait to complete a thorough refilling and to show one at a bar-tour quarter of which you have never heard before;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would design apartments from the ground up to the other?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the thought of shared participation?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that enable us to society and relationships instead of solitude and isolationism.</seg>
<seg id="239">"in South Korea's capital, Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking spaces that belonged to the government"</seg>
<seg id="240">Have been offered to residents. students who were looking for a place to stay</seg>
<seg id="241">"were conveyed to people whose children were moved out. incubators programs were started,"</seg>
<seg id="242">"to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. over our platform alone, 785,000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a foreign or even host."</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea doesn't seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We didn't reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">There was hospitality before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why has our work just worked?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from happiness and timing, we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">"I find it amazing,"</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda goes past me.</seg>
<seg id="253">"we know, of course, that design cannot solve any problem."</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us, if it had this big impact, I wonder what we can use for design soon."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"or oppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I do not give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media are people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study found that 80% of reporting about Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: Americans think most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met a Muslim: it's great to get to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">"I am introverted,"</seg>
<seg id="271">A Möchtegern fitness fanatic</seg>
<seg id="272">"and I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born this way."</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">"when I was 17, I decided to outen myself."</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist friends were horrified: "why do you suppress yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">"the funny thing was that at that time it was a declaration of independence for me, in contrast to the pressure I felt as 17-year-old, to adapt myself to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have struggled with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, thought, posed, doubted, and finally believed."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was trust and slow dedication that deepened with every reading of the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to tears.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">"did you ever feel that someone perceives you, understands you completely, and yet somehow loves?"</seg>
<seg id="287">That's how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">"later I got married and started, like all the good Egyptians, my career as an engineer."</seg>
<seg id="289">"later, after my marriage, I had a child, and basically lived the" Egyptian-American Dream. ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came the terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast at the end, looked at the screen and saw the word" "breaking". ""</seg>
<seg id="293">"there was smoke, airplanes flew into buildings, people jumped out of the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical malfunction?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned rapidly into rebellion.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should I do something like that?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I changed the television channel and heard:..." Muslim terrorists..., "..." in the name of Islam...,... "..."... "..."... "..."... "..."... "</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">"it was not only my country attacked, but in the Nu the deeds of others turned me into a suspect."</seg>
<seg id="302">"on the same day, we had to travel through the Midwest of the USA to move to a new city and start postgraduate studies."</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember how I was silent -- when we were silent -- so deep it went into my seat, and I was afraid to be recognized as a Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="304">"we moved into our apartment this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"and then I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations, who said," Be vigilant, "Be careful," Be careful, "" Abide in well lit areas, "" Same not. "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed indoors all week.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gathered to pray.</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warnings:" "don't go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I looked at the extensive reporting.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were understandably unfiltered, and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people that were considered to be Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked this country attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have got rid of the anger of the people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly explain themselves.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I have nothing against questions, I love questions."</seg>
<seg id="319">These are the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">"today, we can actually hear people say," There is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims. "</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we get rid of them?</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my community as from a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It is only the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumour is removed as a whole and a benign tumour can only be observed under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is falsely posed.</seg>
<seg id="327">"like all other Americans, Muslims are not a tumor in the body of the US, but a vital organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">"Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympic masks."</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques make America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">"there might be a few parking lots, but not stopping the terror."</seg>
<seg id="332">Regular visit of a mosque leads to viewing people of other faiths tolerant and showing greater civic participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as a leader of the police in the Washington D.C. area recently said, people are actually not radicalised in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"in the radicalization process, one has noticed that it begins online. first, the person is cut off from their community, even from their family, so that the extremism group can make a brainwashing, and anyone who abhors their behavior and ideology is a traitor or of faith."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalization, we must stop people to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"as a Muslim, as a mother, as a human, I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imagination when one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam such as the Ku-Klux clan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology grounds on their "holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but if you take a look at them, they do not drive what they read in their" Holy Scriptures. ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things into the scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she pretended to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said that the problem was exactly the opposite. every spiritual man, with whom she spoke, brought her to silence, and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring them into trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"inspired by nothing and something that would make sense to her anger, it was a major goal for the instrumentalization through extremists who promised a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam restored the connection to God and her church.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of accusing them for their anger, he showed her constructive ways of real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque kept her from joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how Islamophobia concerns me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">"how does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?"</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neurological studies -- show: if we fear we happen to pass at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">"we rather accept an authoritarian government system, conformity and prejudice."</seg>
<seg id="360">"a study reveals that when people submit messages in which negative about Muslims were reported, they were more likely to have military attacks on Muslim countries, as well as circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"when you look at when the mood against Muslims rose upward -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool to manipulate the public to undermine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">"we may feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear hurts us all."</seg>
<seg id="368">"when assigning collective guilt, it is not just about explaining oneself."</seg>
<seg id="369">"Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple living in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school."</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was an athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">"he was talented at the dental faculty, talented, promising..."</seg>
<seg id="372">"his sister would say to me that he was the sweetest, most generous person she knew."</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was stunned and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "when did my brother become such an accomplished young man?" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">"just a few weeks after visiting Suzanne with her brother and wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, has murdered her, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who had posted expressions against Muslims on his Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="376">He shot at Deah eight times.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism can not only be immoral but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or stay safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about which America we wanted to leave our children: one that would control us by fear, or one in which we can freely exercise our religion."</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the child's seat, we drove silent, with high pressure to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took it out, pulled out my shoes, went into the prayer hall, and what I saw let me stop."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the assembled people were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us."</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment I collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had the courage and compassion brought about panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose at the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be safe on number?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join those who mean: we are better than that.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="395">"Helen Walters: so, Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve."</seg>

<seg id="407">What began as a platform for hobbyists is just about becoming a billionaire business.</seg>
<seg id="408">"control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the potential applications for commercial drones."</seg>
<seg id="409">"before air-pact formation penetrated into our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines at Frac Centre in France has built a six-meter high tower of 1 500 bricks. some years ago, they began to fly with ropes."</seg>
<seg id="410">"by connecting to each other, air devices reach high speed and acceleration in confined spaces."</seg>
<seg id="411">They can also build self-resilient structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">"they have learned to carry loads, deal with turmoil and generally react to natural laws."</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our aim is to cross the limits of possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"in order for a system to operate autonomously, it must collectively know where in the room the mobile objects are located."</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos, we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratory."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">"each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, determine calculations on board what the machine should do."</seg>
<seg id="420">"external commands exist on the highest level e. g." "start" "and" "land". ""</seg>
<seg id="421">"this is a so-called tailstarter,"</seg>
<seg id="422">An aircraft that tries to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">"like other Starrexcursionists, it is efficient in advance, much more efficient than helicopters in all its variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"in contrast to most of the star wings, it can float, and therefore has great advantages at start and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a downside."</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of rear-starters is that they react sensitively to turbulence such as wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flight unit doesn't matter in what position the optimum position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often ask ourselves basic abstract questions which advance at the core of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">"such a question would be, for example, what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?"</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">"helicopters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts, which gather to hurt you."</seg>
<seg id="434">"decades ago, trained pilots were able to fly remotely controlled aircraft that had only two movable parts: a propeller and a stern rudder."</seg>
<seg id="435">"recently, we discovered that flying is working with only one."</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the monospinner, the mechanically simplest remote controlled aircraft. it was invented recently."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only one movable part, one propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no flaps, hinges and transverse rudder, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanically simple, the inner life happens a lot so that it can fly stable and move everywhere in the room."</seg>
<seg id="440">"however, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear-starters. to bring it to fly, I have to throw it right."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the probability of throwing it right correctly, if all watch me is small, so I'll show you a video filmed last night."</seg>
<seg id="442">"if the Monospinner is an exercise in pleasure, this machine is here, the OmniCopter with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this superabundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetric.</seg>
<seg id="445">Therefore he is ambivalent in his alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">"by doing so, he will receive the extraordinary ability,"</seg>
<seg id="447">"move in space in all directions, no matter which direction it is turned or even as it rotates."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight propellers."</seg>
<seg id="449">"some models can be seen in models, the rest is learned directly while flying."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see this.</seg>
<seg id="451">"if flying machines are to be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate two propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">It turns clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other anti-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">"when you build them, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter."</seg>
<seg id="456">"but if something goes wrong -- an engine or propeller falls out, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly further, though limited."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate this by making half flightless.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examines synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the large number of autonomous, coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">We accepted standard Micro-Quadcopter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">"each unit knows where in the room it is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit."</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully you motivate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine there would like to be a flying shade screen on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us the salary is in development and the creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">"it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and magical our universe is, and that it allows creative, smart creatures to shape them in such a spectacular way."</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">"approximately 1.3 billion years ago, two black holes circled each other in a very distant galaxy, transforming the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second into pure energy."</seg>
<seg id="470">"for this short moment, they lit up brighter than all stars in all galaxies of the entire known universe."</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big boy.</seg>
<seg id="472">"their energy, however, were not set free in the form of light --"</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into the space-time structure itself and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us arrange events at first.</seg>
<seg id="476">"more than 1.3 billion years ago, multi-cell life was created on Earth."</seg>
<seg id="477">"since then the earth has produced a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans and -- God stands at -- even the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="478">"approximately 25 years ago, a group of particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss from the MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gravitational-waves, which arise about by colliding black holes."</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them thought they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognised them as crazy geniuses so that the US National Science Foundation financed her idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">"after decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work, they built the Detector Ligo: the laser interferometer gravitational-wave observatory."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the following years, the precision of Ligo increased significantly, which greatly improved detection performance."</seg>
<seg id="483">This is why it is now called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">"in early September 2015, Ligo was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor, persistent problems."</seg>
<seg id="485">"on September 14, 2015, only a few days after the commissioning of the detector, the gravitational waves of the two colliding black holes pushed through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="486">You went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell to my death-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">"in essence, this was the fruits of my life."</seg>
<seg id="492">"AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been studying gravitational-waves from black holes and their through observatories, like ligo-measurable signals. but what are gravitational-waves?"</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a cramping in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"in passing the wave, the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and squeezed into the other."</seg>
<seg id="495">"for illustrative purposes, lecturers in courses on relativity theory often lead a really silly dance."</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dusting, stretching and dusting."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational-waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on September 14, for example, each of us was stretched and stretched at the arrival of the waves. the stretching of an average man was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"that is 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five-kilometre laser detector, and this is already absurd, this length would have to be measured on less than a thousandth of a nucleus of a nucleus. that's grotesque."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">"Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, described the following:" the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous. "</seg>
<seg id="503">"but physicists are inventive and with the support of the public, all obstacles will certainly be overcome."</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this in 1973 and 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott loves to say that Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your cell."</seg>
<seg id="508">"this is quite practical, because so you can create an image or a map of things by perceiving the light around you from several points."</seg>
<seg id="509">"in terms of sounds, that is different."</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 metres.</seg>
<seg id="511">"that is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you:"</seg>
<seg id="512">About the face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead, we listen to certain properties like pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume to close the story behind it."</seg>
<seg id="514">"now, just says Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob breaks them down." ""</seg>
<seg id="516">"stupid Bob,"</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot make simple pictures of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by paying attention to changes in amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">"so when we convert wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear the universe."</seg>
<seg id="522">"listening to the gravitation can tell us much about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a very long time."</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, non-rotating holes, circular: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">"turn the two bodies very quickly, you can hear the same chirping with an additional tone change. that sounds like: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!"</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement vocabulary that shapes into the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14th 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- heard Ligo the following: [surrendering noise] Somone who knows what he has to hear knows this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes each with 30-fold solar mass that revolves around as fast as the bars of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let us think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, circling a hundred times per second before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know of it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">This consists of the permanent importance of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">"ligo paves a completely new way to explore the universe, as it has never been possible before."</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the All and hear the Invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">"much in space, we can -- practically or basically -- not see."</seg>
<seg id="536">"a supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in Supernovae."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. from them we have learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">"but the exciting physical processes happen in the core that lies behind thousands of kilometres of iron, carbon and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never go through because these are opaque.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gravitational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see them as the Big Bang is covered by his own reflection."</seg>
<seg id="541">"with the help of gravitational-waves, it should be possible to look back to the beginning."</seg>
<seg id="542">"and the most important thing: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, we will never see and of whom we have no idea. things that we only discover by listening."</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, Ligo found things right in the first attempt that we didn't expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says on this subject: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes, as Ligo watches them, are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"they are enormous, ancient bodies of prehistoric times. the black holes are so to speak the Saurierknochen for our archaeological work."</seg>
<seg id="546">"Ligo gives us a completely different view of the events in space, the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we came out of this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now is to be as bold as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">"thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and chirping of the cosmos."</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than to listen to the Big Bang?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">You dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried out an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"for a year, I would say" "Yes!" "in front of which I was afraid."</seg>
<seg id="556">"no matter if it made me nervous, brought me into uncomfortable situations, I forced myself to say" "Yes". ""</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">"no, but yes!"</seg>
<seg id="559">Do I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">"no, but yes!"</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start playing?</seg>
<seg id="562">"no, no, no, yes, yes, yes."</seg>
<seg id="563">"and a crazy thing happened: to do exactly what I feared, my fear eliminated."</seg>
<seg id="564">"my fear of keeping speeches, my social fear -- puff, away."</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes" has changed my life.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">"but there was a definite yes, which changed my life deeply, to an unexpected. it started with a matter of my little ones."</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson."</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she had a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"kittens, I need milk for my beak-cup."</seg>
<seg id="572">"she once asked her if I could play with her when I was just on the go. and I said," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"from that point on, I always tried to play with them as soon as you ask me. no matter what I'm doing, or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">"almost. I'm not perfect, but I am very tired."</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, on my children, to our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an amazing side effect: only recently I fully understood that the "yes" say to play with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am a writer. I think things like that you are contemplating life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I screamed TV. I'm producing television.</seg>
<seg id="585">"I make television, in a great style."</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program in the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">"four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production."</seg>
<seg id="588">Every show has hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"a new episode every nine days, four shows, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three programmes at the same time: 24 episodes: show To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours TV,"</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">"in America, my television series runs one after the other on Thursday evening."</seg>
<seg id="594">"all over the world, my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers."</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are broadcasts that I have created and not only produced, so on top. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather around my fans around bonfires and tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four television series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires burning around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is doing that?</seg>
<seg id="598">"no one, therefore I am a Titan."</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with this.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think when the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">"I'm telling you that all of you who work so hard, whether you're running a company, a country or a classroom, a business or household, take me seriously, and it's true when I say: I understand that it's not about dreaming in a dream job."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I work a lot, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"when I am immersed in the work, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">"it is as if I set up troops, when I painted on a screen."</seg>
<seg id="608">"as a portrait of a high sound, a marathon should be delivered."</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">"she is creative, mechanical, strenuous and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and reasonable. and the best part is the sum."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work is going well.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a buzz starts in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzzing sounds like a busy street, I could drive for ever on it."</seg>
<seg id="615">"many people assume, when I explain to them the sums that I am talking about writing that writing gives me joy."</seg>
<seg id="616">"don't understand me wrong, it does."</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the buzzing -- when I began working and working with television production when I started working and working, building, creating, and working together, I discovered this thing, this buzz, this energy."</seg>
<seg id="618">The sum is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The buzzing is action and activity. the sum is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The buzzing is music. the buzzing is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sum is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a sum, you can not strive for size."</seg>
<seg id="623">"feeling not to be different than aiming for size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps genius is called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I know only that I am not made for failure, and I know only that I love the sum."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I just want to tell you, I'm a Titan, and I know I don't want to question it."</seg>
<seg id="632">"the more work there are, the more things work at the same time, the more things are happening, the more I write history, the more expectations there are."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to be successful, the more I have to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love work, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the land I created, the marathon I run, the army, the screen, the high sound, the buzzing, the buzzing, the buzzing."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sum. I love the sum.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sum. I am the sum.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this buzz?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the buzzing stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">"overhauled, overloaded, overhauled, burned out."</seg>
<seg id="642">The buzzing stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mum is a single stitch.</seg>
<seg id="644">"Harper tells people," My mom won't be there, but you can write to my Nanny. "</seg>
<seg id="645">"and Emerson says," "Well, I want to go to Shonda-Land."</seg>
<seg id="646">They are the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1, when the buzzing ceased."</seg>
<seg id="649">The buzzing of the engine was silent.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my job any more. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The buzzing did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My hum was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I made the same things as usual: the same Titans work, 15 hours-days, working weekends, no regrets, nothing delegating, a Titan doesn't sleep, doesn't give up, with all my heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sum.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">"I was a show-Titan,"</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was grey, I just had no fun."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzzing and the buzzing I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do if what you do is suddenly fade out of the work you love?</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know some may think:" "beware, stupid author-Titan."</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know you're doing it, you're working, you're a teacher, a banker, a mum, a painter, Bill Gates, one loves to be a painter, a banker, a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, and knows how to stop buzzing when the buzzing stops, who is one then?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"if the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern state waitress" asks me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I'm on the way to the outside, late and she says:" "mother, do you like to play?"</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say no when two things become aware of me:</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I must say yes to everything and secondly, she didn't call me" "pussy." ""</seg>
<seg id="675">"she doesn't call anyone" "pussy." ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When did that happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I miss it when I'm Titan and my summing is smoother, and everything changes in front of my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says:" "mother, do you like to play?"</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about it.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and her sisters bump us, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" Everybody Poops. ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding because my pain and panic, in the loneliness and lack of summing, I can't do anything except to watch out."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am silent.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the country I created, the marathon I run, the army, the screen, the high sound - they no longer exist."</seg>
<seg id="687">"all that exists are sticky fingers and wet kisses, delicate voices, waxing pencils and the song in which it is about letting go, or whatever the girl get in" The Ice Queen. ""</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so short that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me solves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door enters and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and that doesn't happen immediately, but it happens, it happens."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The buzz is coming back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, barely there, it's quiet, barely audible, but it's there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the buzzing, but a buzz."</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I know a magical secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the buzzing, the humming, the titanium umming, that is only the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are when I tell you who I am, when I describe myself with the help of broadcasts and TV lessons and how functionally my brain is, then I forgot what the real sum is."</seg>
<seg id="707">The sum is not a force and it is not labour-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sum depends on the love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The buzzing is the stream that comes from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sum is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"the real buzzing ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be done, the expectation and the pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real hum is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"the real sum is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered the wrong words to me, because what God told me that I am a Titan?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a little more love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"as soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">"I do this as a rule, so that I can free myself from any guilt as a workaholic."</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is law, I have no choice. I have no choice if I want to hear the summing again."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing is not easy for me how to work.</seg>
<seg id="722">"the truth hurts,"</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to work at the workplace as at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this admission is painful, because what a person prefers to work than to be home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well, I."</seg>
<seg id="728">"honestly, I call myself" "Titan" "--"</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">None of it is that I am too relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="731">"we rush around in the garden, before and back, back and forth."</seg>
<seg id="732">"we make small dance parties,"</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">"I mainly feel stiff, absent and confused."</seg>
<seg id="736">I always take my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is ok.</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how to live, and the sum of the universe fills me."</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever stopped playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">"perhaps you consider me naive, for a daydream."</seg>
<seg id="742">"you're right, but you can do it too!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they're not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">"my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes, until they think they want to do something else."</seg>
<seg id="748">"they are wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a Marienkäfer or biscuit replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">"and talk to my teenie-daughter for a whole 15 minutes with me, I am the mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"there are only 15 minutes, more do not need."</seg>
<seg id="752">"everyone can bring about 15 minutes a day, even on a bad mood day!"</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a day!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction."</seg>
<seg id="755">"the day is short: dinner, the children are ready to pray."</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my welfare, my world. they don't have to be the children. it is necessary to feel the buzz, to have a place for peace of mind."</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children. it's about pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="759">"in order to" "play" "in general."</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what is good for you.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find it out and keep it.</seg>
<seg id="763">"I'm not perfect in that. I'll retire and I will be victorious. meet friends, read books, enjoy the day --"</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in training, when I wanted to surpass myself more and more. "</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes a bit - why not treat yourself to full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong about it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The buzzing came back in my spare time. the buzzing seems to return when I don't work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul."</seg>
<seg id="770">"I like the buzzing, but I don't love it."</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">"I am not the buzzing, the buzz is not me... no more."</seg>
<seg id="773">"soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends."</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my sum.</seg>
<seg id="775">The buzzing of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The buzzing of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">"the sum of the work is part of me, but just a part. and I am so grateful for that."</seg>
<seg id="778">It's snowy to me that I'm a Titan. I have never seen a Titan who wants to travel to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still working. my campfire is still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">"the more I play, the happier I and my children."</seg>
<seg id="782">"the more I play, the more I feel as a good mother."</seg>
<seg id="783">"the more I play, the clearer my head."</seg>
<seg id="784">"the more I play, the better I work."</seg>
<seg id="785">"the more I play, the more I hear the sum."</seg>
<seg id="786">"the more I feel this buzz, the more this unusual, lasting, bare and new feeling of life in me is wide. less Titan -- more I!"</seg>
<seg id="787">"the more I feel exactly this sum, the more I know who I am."</seg>
<seg id="788">I am a writer. I think things like that. I am considering you life.</seg>
<seg id="789">"this is part of the job, which means living his dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">"this is the dream of this job,"</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dream job should be a bit dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">"I said," "Yes" "to less work and more games."</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans don't have a chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another after a serious stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgeons, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very small ability for self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a severe injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a lasting, severe disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became a functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">"they certainly have heard of one of the most well-known, the" "deep brain stimulation". "in doing so one implanted an electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits of the neurons in such a way as to improve the neurological function."</seg>
<seg id="805">It is truly an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease that suffered from severe trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation however does not mean neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">"with some help, the brain can help itself."</seg>
<seg id="811">History began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">"at that time, I was a senior doctor and worked in the emergency room for day and night."</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I supplied patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">"you must imagine that with skull-brain trauma, the brain swells and the cranial pressure increases."</seg>
<seg id="815">"in order to save life, it is necessary to reduce the pressure of the skull."</seg>
<seg id="816">"for this, sometimes you have to remove some swollen brain mass."</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Letting cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">"you have to find proper nutrition, temperature, humidity and environments to thrive."</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">"after many attempts, Jean-François managed to win."</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw that under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells, which are surrounded by small, unripe cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">"perhaps you still know from the biology lesson that stem cells are immature cells, which can turn into any cell type of the organism."</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to get this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operation.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They spread slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but behaved differently."</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our brain-tex-cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">"at the stage of the fetus, they are responsible for the folding of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay?</seg>
<seg id="845">We don't know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they are taking part in the healing of the brain, as we find them close to brain injuries in higher concentrations."</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so secure.</seg>
<seg id="848">But one thing is clear -- from these cells we got our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand in front of a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">"we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area, and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean-François did."</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark them in color in order to be able to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">"in the last step, we reimplanted them at the outlet point of the same individual."</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we integrate these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we reimport the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">"thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with apes."</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario we introduced the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they had been removed again, they go back home."</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added an injury to and reimplantate exactly the same cells and now cells remained -- they grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been reimported.</seg>
<seg id="862">"the evidence they show are these small points. these are the cells we dye in vitro, in culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">"of course, we couldn't stop here."</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets from one tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">"when they had achieved a stable skill level, we injured the motor-motor-motor area in the motor-driven cortex."</seg>
<seg id="869">"as a result, the monkeys were paralyzed, they could not move their hand any more."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it would happen with people, they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree, just like after a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">"patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover to some degree, just like the monkeys."</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were certain that the monkey had reached its level of spontaneous recovery, we implant his own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">"on the left side, they see the monkeys that spontaneously recovered."</seg>
<seg id="874">It can produce about 40% to 50% of its original performance from injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now, when we reimport the cells, see the same monkey, two months after the implantation."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that this was very exciting for us as well.</seg>
<seg id="878">"since that time, we have found out a lot more about these cells."</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it and use it later.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use them in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease."</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implant them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I will soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>

<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that just now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think:" I know someone who needs that. "</seg>

<seg id="886">"of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials."</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. based on these great results you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this kind of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">"BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc."</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team."</seg>

<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authority allow us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">"it takes a long time to choose the patients, perform the treatments and evaluate if it is useful to do this kind of treatment."</seg>
<seg id="896">"after that, you have to apply this to a multi-center study."</seg>

<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them as self-evident.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality, but as an inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to look at it as an immutable fact.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is perfectly possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy is fading away in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- I was unequivocally clarified as Minister of Finance in the Eurogroup, that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- should not influence the austerity programmes implemented in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at this moment, I thought there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my soaked friends who repeatedly said that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China, and even the Eurogroup have erased a mistake, we could save democracy, but that we need a true and defenceless democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"without democracy our societies will be brighter, our future gloomy and our great new technologies are wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the subject of waste, I would like to point out an interesting contradiction which currently threatens our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">"I call it the" "twin peaks" "paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">"you know and recognize him as the debt mountain, who throws his long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all recognize the debt mountain,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash, which belongs to the wealthy savers and corporations, who, however, are too anxious to invest there where it would be productive and to produce income with which one could contribute to the debt mountain and also to produce all the things that humanity needs, such as" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"over the past 3 months, in the United States, in England and in the euro area, 3,4 trillion US dollars have been invested in all the wealth producing goods such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so forth."</seg>
<seg id="922">"3.4 trillion US dollar sounds like a lot of money, until one compares it with the 5.1 trillion US dollar, which at the same time were lying around in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing, except to inflate the stock markets and raise the real estate prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus, debt and unproductive capital form the twin peaks that are not equated by the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the USA, Japan and Europe unemployed, and consequently a low macroeconomic demand, which, as in a continuous loop, encourages the pessimism of investors that would be true that his son would kill him when he is grown up,"</seg>
<seg id="925">Unintentionally causes the circumstances causing Ödipus to kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">That is my Haders with Capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"his very wasteful art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents, and especially finance all the technologies," green "technologies that are crucial for saving the earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue: what do we understand under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the social form in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">"the Athenian democracy, of course, closed too many --"</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">But it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of the Athenian democracy due to these exclusions.</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decision at the Athenian democracy was and is that it withdrew the working poor, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive that they grant them the right to political co-determination with the same tendency to vote in questions of the state's concerns."</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy did not last long --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle, which shines very bright, it is burnt out quickly."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, today's liberal democracies did not have their roots in ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious Revolution of 1688, even in the American Constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the Athenian democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which was ultimately a statute for rulers."</seg>
<seg id="940">"the liberal democracy did not come until a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics, while the economy -- i.e. the world of corporations -- became a democracy-free zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in today's democracies, since the time that this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two is taking place, while the economy gradually undermines politics and dismages them."</seg>
<seg id="942">Wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not on a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because today it is possible to be in the government and still not in power because the power of politics is migrated into the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hair with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"if you think about it, it is about like a herd of carnivores that sustainably decimated the animals from which they feed themselves, that they end up starving at the end."</seg>
<seg id="947">"the power of the corporations is growing, political goods are depreciated, political goods are depreciated, the inequality rises, the general economic demand falls and the general managers of the corporations are too frightened to invest the cash of their companies."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful capitalism sells the" demos "from democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour-power and the prosperity of mankind."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if that is true, it is obvious that we have to bring together politics and the economy, and it would be better if the" demo "retains control, just as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">"this, by the way, is not a new idea."</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist Left had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine of the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain their position as in ancient Athens without creating new forms of brutality and extravagance.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: to abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers with automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is that so long economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin peaks higher, the waste is more sublime, and the social conflicts deeper, as it is -- already very soon, as I believe -- will come in countries like China."</seg>
<seg id="956">"thus we need to redesign the economy and reunite the spheres of economy and politics, and make sure that we are democratizing the re-unified field, otherwise we end in a disease-like surveillance hyperautocracy, which makes the film" Matrix "appear as a documentation."</seg>
<seg id="957">"the question is, therefore, not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has produced --"</seg>
<seg id="958">"the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to that in" Star Trek, "in which machines serve human beings, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians" Agora, "in long conversations with the meaning of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">"so what would it be like to have this" "Star Trek" "-like utopia rather than the" "Matrix" "similar dystopia?"</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the area of companies: please introduce a capital market where you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from one job to the next, from one company to the next, and the company -- no matter in which you are working -- is the property of those currently working in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income from capital and from redeeming and the concept of wage labour is completely obsolete.</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction between those who belong to the companies, but they do not work therein, and employees who work there that the company does not belong to. no more exchange between capital and labour, no gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no uplifting twin peaks."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the area of global political economy: please introduce yourself briefly that our national currencies would have a vacillating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interests of all humanity."</seg>
<seg id="966">"imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it" the cosmos, "in units of" Cosmos "-- and every government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the country into a mutual fund."</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that this fund invests in green technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rar."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today, we have them, especially against the background of a reunified policy and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world I describe to you is at the same time a liberal party in which it prefers privileged people, and Marxist because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the rubbish of history, and Keynesian, global Keynesian."</seg>
<seg id="973">"but above all else, it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy."</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we awaken in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a matrix - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it more democratic.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as a libertarian Marxists in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">"Yanis Varoufakis: if anything of what I have just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant."</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for reunification of politics and economy is... do we not do this, technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand, which Larry Summers describes as a" long term stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"by transferring this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next, as we experience it, it will destabilize not only our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is true, then Marx is quite relevant,"</seg>
<seg id="986">"just like Hayek, that's why I am a liberal Marxist, and like Keynes, and that's why I am totally mad."</seg>
<seg id="987">"BG: in fact, and now we are well."</seg>
<seg id="988">"YV: if you're not working, you don't think enough."</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek one kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said this. BG: in your speech you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers you have clearly stated what you are holding from the West's point of view.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a huge measure of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the appearance of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my speech, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of it plays -- the area of economics -- is a fully democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in a certain sense, if I can say so provocative, China today resembles the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">Remember -- we tend to combine liberalism with democracy -- that's a mistake historically regarded.</seg>
<seg id="996">"liberalism, Liberals, as John Stuart Mill --"</seg>
<seg id="997">It was particularly sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">"what we can see now in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"to blame China now, to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smells like hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I thought that's coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later in the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing as we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the Eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"to say good-bye to ourselves, and the permanent denial that a massive deduction line passed through the eurozone, and continues to be massively threatened by the development of the whole European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which, by the way, was the first proposal that revealed this denial --"</seg>
<seg id="1008">"unfortunately, within the Euro zone, the powers within the eurozone have still voted for denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if you try to get an economic system that is not viable to live by political will and authoritarianism, you might delay it for a while, but if the change occurs, it happens abruptly and destructive."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: which changes do you anticipate?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- Seriously...</seg>
<seg id="1017">"if there is a finance minister or any minister who has been in office after 6 months, especially in such a tense situation, he has no mistake, then this is a dangerous person."</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest in the financiers' pages to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But there was no such thing.</seg>
<seg id="1022">"they just wanted to bring our government down, just because they didn't want to deal with the distortions that ran through the eurozone."</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't want to admit that for five years they had been carrying out a disastrous program in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">It is worse than during the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">"none of the Troika's creditors, who imposed this policy on us, confessed:" "this was a colossal mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1027">"BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive tone of talks, you seem to be quite pro-European."</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"" "my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe."</seg>
<seg id="1030">My biggest fear is that the eurozone is not outlived.</seg>

<seg id="1038">"most of them have never heard of Roy Price, although he is probably responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on April 19, 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy hit three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a senior employee at Amazon Studio.</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slim, has a hedgehog hairstyle and describes itself on Twitter as" Movies, TV, Technology, Tacos. ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very hard-fought industry."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV shows that Roy does not have any choice.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he has to find shows, which are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he has to find shows that are on the right hand corner of this curve."</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the assessment of over 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the level shows how many shows will receive this review.</seg>
<seg id="1050">"if your show is valued at nine and above, it is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these are shows like" Breaking Bad, "" Game of Thrones, "" The Wire "-- all the shows that are addictive, where, after watching a relay, your brain asks:" where are there more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left hand side, here at this end, shows like" "Toddlers and Tiaras" "-- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price doesn't worry about getting on the left side of the curve because I think you need special intelligence to entertain "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he makes more thoughts about the middle charge, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't inspire."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the print is available, and of course it's the first time Amazon is doing so, so Roy Price doesn't want to risk anything."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he needs guaranteed success, so he keeps a competition."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes a lot of ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation, then he will produce the first episode of each of these shows and makes them online where they can watch them for free."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon publishes stuff for free, is it possible to access correctly?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers watch these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know they will be watched while watching these shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who are recording everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you can record when to start the show, when you pause, which parts you can jump over or over again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce with these data.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they collect the data, process them and this results in the answer, and this is:" Amazon should make a sitcom via four Republican U.S. senators. "</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," Alpha House, "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't that good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it's just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House is 7.5 -- so something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for the programming of Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking to find them a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it a bit different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of hosting a competition, he and his team looked at the available data on the Netflix audience, so the reviews they give to the shows whose course they like etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then they use this data to find out these little details about the spectators: what shows they like, what producers, what actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all the parts together, they entered a venture and decided not to make a sitcom about four senators, but a drama series about a senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," House of Cards. "Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons."</seg>
<seg id="1079">House of Cards "gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">"of course, the question is: what happened here?"</seg>
<seg id="1081">"there are two very competitive, data sealed companies."</seg>
<seg id="1082">"they connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company."</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is the reason for this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because the logic somehow implies that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"if you collect millions of data for a decision you meet, you should make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"the least thing you can expect is good television, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis does not work so, this is something frightening, because we live in a time where we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"no one. OK, that's even good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-health system is a software company and I hope that no one in this room will ever come into contact with this software. come into contact with it you are in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if someone is in prison here and asks for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge occurs or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"moderate television, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, in spite of the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are produced. this is not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data of the most experienced companies is also wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"in 2009, Google announced that by data analysis they can predict breakouts of flu, the bad way -- by data analysis of Google searches."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked flawlessly, year around year until suddenly it didn't work anymore,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it just didn't work, this was again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the magazine" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data of the most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"despite all these errors, data streams increasingly in decisions of life -- at the workplace, in law enforcement, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know a lot of difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very smart people unimaginable lots of data to make serious decisions such as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"you have to solve a complex problem, mainly two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"first, put this problem into its individual parts so that you can analyze the individual parts; as a branch, put the items together again to create a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful they can only help to dismantle a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all have it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">"if there is something in which the brain is good, it is possible to assemble parts and pieces, even if the information is incomplete, in order to gain a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"therefore, I think Netflix was so successful because they used data and minds, where they also belong to the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise have not been able to. but the decision how to put all these parts together again and make a show like" House of Cards, "that was not in the data."</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show which meant that they took a big personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">"on the other hand, Amazon did this in the wrong way."</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their decisions, first when competing for TV ideas, then they chose" Alpha House "as a show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">"it was a safe decision because they could always say," "They tell us the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data are helpful for better decisions, but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are just one tool, and in order not to forget it, this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before there was data, this was the device for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball." it's amazing. for decisions using a ja- or no-question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely" -- right here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will make it out later with a technology demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"I have made some decisions in my life so far, whereby I should have listened to the ball afterwards."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you naturally know, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them with a much more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"in the end, it is up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as very encouraging news that, despite the large amount of data, it still pays off to make decisions, to be an expert in what you are doing and taking risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"in the end, it is not the data, but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
