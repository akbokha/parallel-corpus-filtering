Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards that will change your view of the city
an Ir@@ ren @-@ Anst@@ alt where youngsters are to meet today .
&quot; a mine chapel , where it is now dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel . &quot;
farmers cultivate the former cause of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories .
it &apos;s annoying if maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows this because the car Nav@@ i showed a green meadow instead of a stra@@ y road .
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ at@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als Bavarian state government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - but especially informative . &quot;
especially when compared to current online maps .
then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed since the 19th century in the spread @-@ area of Munich Mer@@ cury .
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work which is not immediately recognized as such .
&quot; in the large overview map , more detailed maps , so @-@ called original papers , were incorporated into cities and municipalities . &quot;
these were produced according to the Bavarian sur@@ veying management between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographical survey of Bavaria in order - of course for military purposes .
&quot; even though the French troops finally with@@ drew from Lun@@ é@@ ville on 9 February 18@@ 01 , today &apos;s neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide map of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV . Joseph drove the project forward , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bavarian sur@@ veying business . &quot;
the document magazine for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is to be found on the website of the Bavarian State Library .
the comparison of early / today is the most impressive example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
&quot; one example is Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 . &quot;
&quot; S@@ end@@ ling was founded 21 years after the map was created , thus in 18@@ 77 , as a Munich subur@@ b . &quot;
&quot; today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is located in the middle of the city . &quot;
&quot; the houses Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the modern Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 18@@ 78 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : in the zo@@ oming appears a small @-@ part map with dozens of lines and numbers : hand @-@ written numbered pieces from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; primitive &quot; &quot; from which the basic tax was deduc@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; there are no farmers there today , but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; land in the sun . &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
&quot; the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , the Oktober@@ fest site since 18@@ 10 , was in fact a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert . &quot;
on the other side of the Is@@ ar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; in the area of the present district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only street names on &quot; &quot; Gast@@ eig &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Auf der Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at Au@@ er@@ field@@ straße one once locked people with del@@ u@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich district Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; Auf der Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; was established there . &quot;
&quot; from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden headed the institution - that psychiat@@ rist , who is brought to the death of King Ludwig II . &quot;
&quot; he was progressive for his time and ended for example the Ank@@ hing of so @-@ called Ir@@ ren .
&quot; in addition , he prohibited the personnel to use violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen museum , who worked for an exhibition with the institution . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients there was first place , later expanded to 500 places . &quot;
&quot; at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Krei@@ si@@ r@@ ren@@ anstalt in Haar@@ mann in 1905 . &quot;
&quot; since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ry psychiat@@ ri@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt , young people meet in the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um . &quot;
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth hostel with educational establishments .
&quot; West is the football field of TS@@ V Munich East , east of residential buildings from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; was erected in an architectural approach to the original construction of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , which had been destroyed during the Second World War in bomb attacks . &quot;
&quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was registered in 18@@ 56 as the &quot; &quot; main square &quot; , &quot; the Kauf@@ inger@@ strasse was called &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot; &quot;
the Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
&quot; in December 1944 , the Al@@ lies bom@@ bed many holes in the city centre . &quot;
a big one remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
&quot; the English Institute , small business houses and a mine chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days the preliminary work and the ground @-@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn line will take place on 5 April 2017 . &quot;
&quot; with the slider , the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof . &quot;
civil Rights group publishes travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the promotion of coloured people has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to the discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks of the state .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is supposed to enter into force until 28 August 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to take special care when travelling through the state , as a number of question@@ able , racial @-@ based incidents occur in the entire state and be noted here , &quot; stated in the Group &apos;s opinion . &quot;
&quot; a recently adopted law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it more difficult for people to capture discrimination , as well as the law enforcement agencies of the state that dispro@@ portion@@ ately aim for minorities , caused the group to issue the warning , the NA@@ AC@@ P said . &quot;
they have violations of civil rights that happen to people .
&quot; they are stopped because of their skin color , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot;
we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet .
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the US .
&quot; the group cited incidents such as rac@@ ist off@@ ences against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died in question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no more gasoline during the voyage and was taken into custody by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police , without being accused of a crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council also points to a recent report from the Office of the General Public Prosecutor of Mis@@ sour@@ i , showing that black mot@@ orists in the state are 75 percent more often than wh@@ ites . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot;
people must be ready to bring cash or to let relatives know that they travel through the state .
&quot; Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI &apos;s hate crime series , which classi@@ fies the state with respect to the number of such violations in the 16th place of the country . &quot;
the warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company for housing or employment discrimination .
&quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states had passed immigration laws allowing local law enforcement authorities to arrest people on account of immigration violations , which will contribute to further race profil@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but lately stakeholders have implemented the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
electric fence project is elementary
the Fis@@ her@@ bacher Wei@@ de@@ bau@@ n project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year .
the CD@@ U members Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac ordered a picture on the spot .
&quot; at the atri@@ um cemetery of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family , representatives of the Fischer@@ bacher CD@@ U @-@ local association met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann first granted insights into his farm where he managed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as many young k@@ itt@@ ens and accommod@@ ated in five apartments holiday palaces . &quot;
&quot; for him , the &quot; Black Wal@@ der milch &quot; is the alternative market@@ able way for the milk of his cows , such as Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste is exclusively regional .
&quot; as he is also B@@ L@@ H@@ V @-@ Chairman of Fis@@ her@@ bach , he called the electric fence project as &quot; &quot; elementary important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I cannot generate profit on such steep areas .
&quot; the grass@@ land area is a lot of work , much must be processed with the br@@ ush@@ cutter . &quot;
&quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , he took over the parent company and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ zer , even if he did not lead a bio @-@ company . &quot;
&quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; the Commune has recognised the importance of the electric fence project and is happy about the leaders &quot; support . &quot;
&quot; at the cost of 3,000 to 4,000 euros per hect@@ are the farmers would have to be supported . &quot;
it is hoped that the aff@@ or@@ estation of the land could be pulled out for quite a while .
&quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they can continue their operation , &quot; &quot; said the mayor . &quot;
farmers are often critic@@ ised for the promotion
&quot; in 2013 , a total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants . &quot;
&quot; the open @-@ air area is thus 40 hectares , which must not be for@@ ested by at least 20@@ 23 . &quot;
&quot; of the total cost of 71 500 euros , half was promoted by leader , a quarter carried the municipality of Fischer@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; thus , the farmers remained 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres of pasture fence . &quot;
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ gevity of the f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; you do a really good job , without farmers and ma@@ i@@ dens it is not possible . &quot;
also for Peter Weiss it was clear : &quot; best food is produced here . &quot;
the Land@@ scape Conservation Directive ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables the state funding of pasture @-@ f@@ ences .
the goal is the dis@@ continuation of the Black Forest .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; moreover , the area to be en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed must not be smu@@ g@@ gling ( slope incl@@ ination over 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by aff@@ or@@ estation . &quot;
&quot; the request of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence , is currently underway for the Fis@@ her@@ men &apos;s &apos; Wei@@ ght dez@@ v@@ ous Project 2018 &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the disclosure area is 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 1@@ 1,000 euros . &quot;
is nothing sacred anymore ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump is taking the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump Regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N about the President &apos;s proposals for the dr@@ astic restriction of legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to be fair , Miller didn &apos;t handle the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty @-@ I@@ mit@@ es would have infected him if he had done it .
&quot; but it resor@@ ted to its importance , and in particular the meaning that it was attributed to when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base . &quot;
&quot; when Miller A@@ co@@ sta compla@@ ined , &quot; I don &apos;t want to go to a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enligh@@ tens the world . &quot;
&quot; the poem you refer to , which was later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; Miller lies properly properly , but as he said it himself , it &apos;s not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary response to the stirring words of Lazarus , the only one in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ ary , your poor , and your oppressed masses who desire to breathe freely , and the miserable waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time when the &quot; miserable garbage &quot; was better to see on our screens .
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Tr@@ ump@@ ur USA are not welcome .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation : it is indeed a conflict around the meaning of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who used to place her words after her death on the base - knew very well that they took a highly political action .
the sculpture was intended to show the connections between French and American re@@ public@@ anism by presenting the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classical depic@@ tion .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a very different name : mother of the Ex@@ iles .
the link between the poem and the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , the right wing people wanted to change this for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the great writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of Johannes of the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone , but rather an early neo @-@ conservative , who brings the American flame to the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is going forward . &quot;
it should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
the torch should not ligh@@ ten the way into the United States . &quot;
Lim@@ bau@@ gh is quite unusual here .
the meaning of the statue is completely and even a question of the point of view of perception .
&quot; the greatest imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , miserable , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible voy@@ ages on the de@@ cks of ships . &quot;
&quot; in the tru@@ est sense , it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
their statue tells them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear .
&quot; and this , of course , is not the perspective Miller and Tr@@ ump ever want to acknowledge . &quot;
&quot; their torch should not ligh@@ ten the way , but the hatred that is their only source of power . &quot;
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the UK team .
&quot; the performance director of the United Kingdom &apos;s athle@@ tics , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ strong Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship cad@@ re will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017 which ki@@ cks off on Friday .
black believes that &quot; in Scotland something special develops &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it .
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it , and we will continue it until we find out , &quot; Black said . &quot;
I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think that it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they have done .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type at the street corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ ler - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected from the team to the team captain . &quot;
&quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is quite modest .
&quot; their Captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; Black says . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h naturally brought in were great .
&quot; the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver medal winner , who will compete in their fifth world championships at the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les , says it is &quot; unbelievable , &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s best total athlete at the World Championship was seven , which were achieved in 1983 and 2015 . &quot;
the middle @-@ distance runner Mu@@ ir leads this way and last year he set up five British and two European records .
&quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runners . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman who was to watch the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games . &quot;
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world championships as the only other Scot@@ sman in Team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell .
&quot; the team captain says that she is &quot; hu@@ gely proud &quot; of the fact that many of her fellow country@@ men are not only part of the team , but in some cases also ming@@ le with the med@@ als and the fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the special thing about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honor anyway , but knowing that my te@@ amm@@ ate voted for me and chose me makes it something special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
&quot; obviously , I &apos;m very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team . &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
&quot; and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb on po@@ di@@ ums . &quot;
concerning my speech as captain ?
&quot; yes , I think she went well . &quot;
I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there .
block critics on Facebook : do not host a public office if you cannot tolerate the introduction of voters
the father of our country knew something from bad press .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the papers struck him because of everything , from domestic politics to its political principles . &quot;
he shr@@ ank in criticism .
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; in 17@@ 83 , Washington said , &quot; &quot; The freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and dum@@ b we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot;
&quot; this brings me to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who has to work to be more like Washington . &quot;
Ho@@ gans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union su@@ ed him at the beginning of this week .
&quot; the governor &apos;s staff dismissed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , &quot; and ? . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is particularly important if it is a guy like Ho@@ gan .
this is a Repub@@ lican Gover@@ nor in an overwhelming democratic state that is aston@@ ish@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest consent of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary heat head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very clever in using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to play his ha@@ ar@@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
&quot; hence the blocking of persons coming to the side of the governor - which is a public forum , which is called officially and by employees paid with public tax dollars - un@@ necessarily and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans spokes@@ woman Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse defended the Gover@@ nor &apos;s actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation . &quot;
but it is too easy to use the image of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hat@@ eful people who vibr@@ ate online the whi@@ p .
the post talked to some of the real people blocked by Ho@@ gan .
&quot; these are just real people speaking with their chosen leaders : a teacher , a business@@ man and a priest , not troll@@ s . &quot;
&quot; they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not prof@@ ane . &quot;
the pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans ca@@ tho@@ lic faith .
&quot; lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not hat@@ eful , but she asked for hate crimes . &quot;
&quot; I pol@@ itely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other latest news , &quot; she wrote in the comment section of the message &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I also do not appreciate this idea , if a number of people take a position on the same subject , then they are regarded by some rather as a so @-@ called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the Gover@@ nor &apos;s employees referred to as &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; &quot; would probably call &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era simply makes it easy to cut a message by blocking a critic or del@@ eting a negative comment .
&quot; it is much cleaner than in earlier times , if one would have done the same thing that employees were sent to gather and burn newspapers with critical articles and to arrest demonstr@@ ators and to silence them . &quot;
but exactly that just happens digitally .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is accused of Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell last week in Virginia .
&quot; the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County rejected the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to US District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when they banned a vot@@ er from their Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; and in K@@ entu@@ cky , governor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U on account of his use of Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
that shouldn &apos;t be so difficult .
&quot; at the time of Washington , the time of affordable portal had a similar effect as the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letter writers beat on his leadership . &quot;
and even then Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
&quot; people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; wrote letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot;
&quot; peti@@ tions , which critic@@ ised his position on the am@@ ity treaty , trade and shipping with Britain , over@@ powered his ministry , according to the historical documents collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of the George Washington Project . &quot;
but he did not silence them .
freedom of speech and dis@@ courses belong to our nation .
and true leadership means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in Renaissance Club
&quot; the former European No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for home comforts over the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open . &quot;
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , who last year joined Ar@@ cher@@ field &apos;s links to the final round until he lost Paul E@@ ales , is associated with the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ve seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; players will see this course from its best side , it is in a great state . &quot;
Jer@@ ry did a great job when he set up this place .
he is a keen advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
&quot; the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , even though he won the European Tour as well as the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career . &quot;
&quot; that feels really special , &quot; &quot; said the player based in South@@ port . &quot;
I have not been able to defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dur@@ a Open since it was taken out of the program in the year after I won it .
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories from last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here . &quot;
it was a really special time and one we always appreciated .
&quot; Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday this year , returns to his home ground . &quot;
this event will be the first Scottish gig ever since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a little more to play at home , &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man of Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel that extra pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing it again and I played a solid golf .
I &apos;m happy about the way it went so far .
&quot; the trio on the field are the former masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ eil . &quot;
&quot; the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce is one of the six Sc@@ ots in the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mut@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; admission is free , the car park costs £ 5 per car with an occup@@ ant and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers . &quot;
all proceeds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
fewer lung cancer rates due to passive smoking
&quot; over the past two decades , fewer people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer . &quot;
scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates , 16@@ 7 pul@@ mon@@ ary cancer cases are due to passive smoking in 16@@ 7 , &quot; said director Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot;
&quot; as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this subject in 1994 . &quot;
&quot; back then , there have been 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking per year in Germany . &quot;
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
domestic connections prove to be very complex
&quot; the construction work in the Vill@@ inger street is in full swing and &quot; &quot; reasonably in time &quot; , &quot; said Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the area of domestic connections , the situation is more complicated than expected , as there is a lot of se@@ amounts in the underground , which is not mentioned in the plans . &quot;
traffic that hin@@ ders construction work again and again represents a major problem for St@@ ump@@ p &apos;s construction company .
&quot; the ignorance of drivers from red lights and lock@@ ers is already enormous , &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot;
the road is closed and only the regular buses are eligible for passage .
&quot; Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p are busy working on the bridge for weeks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were quite exhau@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; but fortunately , we were treated by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; says Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z . &quot;
poverty and death in Indon@@ esian Gold@@ land
&quot; when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she does not use stove . &quot;
it even rarely uses a pot .
&quot; in its wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent in the rest@@ less Indon@@ esian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually places a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour , the char@@ red tu@@ ber is taken with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands and swal@@ lowed . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture , where she also performs her daily work , e.g. washing dresses with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp . &quot;
a bucket in a homeless room serves as lat@@ rine .
&quot; as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , her fields were not assigned . &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; of course , too late to work can be dangerous : most of the villa@@ gers are unemployed and many drink heavily , and there are the soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to run around in the village after 17 o &apos;clock , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , than only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders by a public lifting in front of the occup@@ ying troops . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , which stir@@ red up the independence of the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the Jak@@ arta government , which enter@@ tains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal observers . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province was officially distributed in Papua and West Papua , and the independent part of Papua New Guinea included the eastern part of the island . &quot;
the trip includes a 90 minute flight from the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the rented car .
there is no public transport .
&quot; the city with about 19@@ .000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses , which are surrounded by bamboo @-@ f@@ ences , and from corrugated board roofs , which were transformed by rust into different yel@@ low@@ ish tones . &quot;
&quot; very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners . &quot;
&quot; before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ an worshipped a god called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wearing these clothes , &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i , pointing to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright rock . &quot;
&quot; in the past , we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot;
&quot; Papua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst child mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia . &quot;
but it is Indonesia &apos;s gold country .
&quot; the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Free@@ port mined gold and copper in value of 3.1 billion US dollars . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the value of estimated 78 billion US dollars , the amount of wood resources is estimated . &quot;
&quot; these riches , however , are a source of misery for the Papua , ensuring that Indonesia &apos;s most powerful military preserves a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence . &quot;
&quot; a 2005 study in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid almost 20 million US dollars between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars to a single officer . &quot;
pap@@ u@@ bian demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
&quot; according to activists , more than 500,000 Papua people have been killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped and imprisoned since 1969 by the Indon@@ esian military . &quot;
&quot; according to the Asia Human Rights Commission , mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as tribal high@@ land in the 1970 &apos;s were genocide . &quot;
&quot; last year alone , the Indon@@ esian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; we value everything &quot; &quot; means in a report from the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese of Bris@@ ban@@ e from 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year include , such as un@@ lawful kill@@ ings and torture - rape and electric strikes are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims , as every week incidents happen , &quot; &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
the screws have increased since Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring a stream of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic development changes since Muslim economic migrants are coming from the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jav@@ an@@ ese waiting cant@@ e@@ ens sell fried chicken and g@@ ado @-@ g@@ ado , a mixed vegetables served with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce . &quot;
local people fight to hold on here .
&quot; migrants began to sell chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than local Papua , &quot; &quot; says A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old pan@@ i@@ ai local native to the provincial capital of J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
&quot; it has cost the native Papua , the Mama @-@ M@@ um &#91; the women &#93; of Papua @-@ their market . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , the Indon@@ esian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known as Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , promised to tackle the ine@@ qualities and violations in the country during his election campaign in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai , on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta . &quot;
&quot; but there is little change in Papua , and today locals feel che@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ v@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai was only two months after Jok@@ o &apos;s inaugur@@ ation in October . &quot;
&quot; on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children was out and sang Christmas songs in front of a camp fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indon@@ esian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle . &quot;
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should switch on their spot@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers picked up their tone and later returned to four soldiers , the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted and beat the group with their guns , said victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
&quot; a child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ o , was so severely beaten that he fell into coma . &quot;
a few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
&quot; about 1,000 young men , women and children gathered on a football ground in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice . &quot;
they carried cerem@@ onial hunting bows and performed the Wa@@ ita dance - in the circle continuously and a bird song im@@ i@@ cip@@ ating - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators started tow@@ ing stones at police and military posts .
&quot; when the mood was heated , a command was sent to the soldier via an internal radio : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; it says in an official TI@@ ME document that has not been released by the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ neighborhood of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for rest and asked the crowd to return home . &quot;
nobody was listening to the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot into my left wrist , &quot; &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the ver@@ and@@ ah of his colourful painted wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame still does not know who fired , but says that the bul@@ let from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here came . &quot;
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , who witnessed the shooting . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was it , &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans only bears a name , the TI@@ ME in glo@@ omy mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him .
&quot; the chief spec@@ tor of the Muslim police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told re@@ porters that his officers wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station simply because they were attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us , &quot; &quot; said the spokesman of the Papua @-@ Police Commissioner , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured . &quot;
the news of the kill@@ ings came only on the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
&quot; three weeks ago , Jok@@ hang in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura gave a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to tackle the historical gri@@ ev@@ ances in Papua . &quot;
&quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will not happen in the future , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , Minister of Security Wi@@ ran@@ to said he had an extra@@ judicial mechanism for expos@@ ing historical human rights violations . &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries have occurred long ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and at the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to tackle these violations , but there are processes that need to be passed , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; then Wi@@ ran@@ to made a retreat when he spoke to TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta , and said he had no plans to establish a complaint mechanism in Papua . &quot;
&quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Wi@@ ran@@ to , who accused the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; demanded more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence referendum , said that 11 cases of human rights violations had already been settled in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot;
the families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such asser@@ tions with fi@@ erc@@ ely un@@ belief .
&quot; I have been inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m afraid of being arrested by the military , I &apos;m afraid to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ obus repeated the view that the people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military searched for me , &quot; he says . &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not ceased .
on Tuesday the Indon@@ esian police fired on villa@@ gers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a confrontation between the villa@@ gers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring an unconscious man to the hospital , one person and 17 others were injured , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Ra@@ vi@@ anus Dou@@ w , drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital . &quot;
the villa@@ gers who were excited prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s office .
the police said that the villa@@ gers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile Bri@@ gade ( Indon@@ esian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot at the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so pan@@ i@@ cked , we were afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured here have been delivered quickly , so the TI@@ ME . &quot;
&quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called upon to hold the officers involved and withdraw the mobile Bri@@ gade of the police from the area .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a troub@@ le@@ maker for the Indon@@ esian government .
&quot; the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the family members of Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , living in the green high@@ lands of Papua . &quot;
&quot; many joined the &quot; Free Papua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , claiming to defend the rights of Papua by con@@ ta@@ gious spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indon@@ esian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbitr@@ arily deta@@ ined , under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot; &quot;
some never appear again .
&quot; among the people of Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ content .
&quot; the little rice , sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is too expensive for locals . &quot;
bread is just as out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : in particular Not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
&quot; agriculture is the task of women , each with four or five fields of sweet potato . &quot;
keep the bulk of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
&quot; ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indon@@ esian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) . &quot;
&quot; over time , economic ine@@ qualities between the native Papua and the new migrants have grown , which since the opening of new routes to the hub of Nab@@ ire have reached greater numbers . &quot;
the few jobs there in the region usually go to the more educated and weal@@ thier migrants .
&quot; in fact , in Papua , the capital or the necessary skills in order to make their own companies competitive . &quot;
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Pan@@ i@@ ai tribal Council . &quot;
isolation holds the eyes of the world far away from Papua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions on reporting international media remain ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ da and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , although they were given the rare permission to film . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ in K@@ ine , the deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises made by Jok@@ o &apos;s election campaign have not been realized in order to promote transparency and development . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s most troubled provinces of Papua and West @-@ pap@@ ua : visa den@@ unciation and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indon@@ esian government is largely confined to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March six Pacific states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread violations &quot; in Papua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting . &quot;
the same countries have historically been supported by the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokesman of the Indon@@ esian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r , rejected the group &apos;s accus@@ ations and said to journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence for human rights cases . &quot;
people on the spot want more foreign governments to take note of this .
&quot; when an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the Human Rights ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4 visited , locals broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that participated in the meeting , but would like to remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the people of Papua say that they will probably not vote for Jok@@ ov@@ i again . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ hang is a person who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribal Council . &quot;
&quot; he wants Jok@@ v@@ ai to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military , is in poor education and health services . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , consider their voice to be a &quot; &quot; blame &quot; &quot; that he has to pay back . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite the threats and in@@ timi@@ dation , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims led a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the body of a victim was buried on a site just opposite the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that perhaps justice will never come to them , but at least they will not forget those responsible for their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus with lowered head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire records the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
&quot; a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest living towers in the world in Dubai , forcing hundreds of inhabitants to flee from the 3@@ 37 @-@ metre high , 79 @-@ storey building . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire that swept through the high @-@ rise in just two years , which is inci@@ dentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ch@@ el tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and when the people shou@@ ted .
&quot; we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; &quot; an inhabit@@ ant told his name as George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters . &quot;
Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that the fire fighting units extingu@@ ished the fire at 4.@@ 00 a.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) and cooled the building .
the government said she is working on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can revi@@ ve questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rise buildings all over the world .
&quot; an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage from the covering , the exterior cl@@ adding for decoration or insulation , came . &quot;
&quot; in Britain , the police said they believe that the system of plates for insulation and disgu@@ ise on the London Gren@@ fell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup reform : more best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Union ( IT@@ F ) has passed through with his large Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly .
&quot; at the Ho Chi Min@@ h City meeting , the Davis Cup Single was only supported by the two @-@ thirds majority for this sport . &quot;
&quot; although often very long , but also very much appreciated five @-@ set classic remain the traditional competition . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3.@@ 54 % of the member countries voted for the reform , the aim of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore barely missed . &quot;
we respect this decision but are disappointed that our member nations did not accept the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup .
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical competitions , &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
we will continue to work to improve the application .
&quot; not until the vote , after many contradictions , the proposal had already come to place the final in a neutral place . &quot;
&quot; new from 2018 are only comparatively small details : in the future , the fin@@ alists will be the host @-@ right in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup in the next round . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements in training places etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to complete fewer official media events prior to the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 out of 5 US travelers bring forbidden items to the plane , find out a pol@@ l &quot;
&quot; a survey among flying passengers revealed that more than 20 percent know@@ ingly smu@@ g@@ gled over 20 percent of prohibited items at the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 per cent who entered the aircraft while they accidentally wore forbidden knives or other items with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 per cent said they had been late discovered that they were mistakenly traveled with fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; the survey of more than 1,000 people , carried out by a jet charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also found that younger travellers rather dis@@ regard the rules . &quot;
&quot; the respon@@ dents who admitted that they know@@ ingly tried to fly with something banned by the T@@ SA were 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent , the members of Generation X . &quot;
the most common items that were deliberately caused by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
&quot; more than 3 percent said to have know@@ ingly carried items with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male respon@@ dents also confirmed that they deliberately brought forbidden drugs into the plane . &quot;
the company said it has inter@@ viewed travelers throughout the country to find out how many mistakenly put smu@@ g@@ gled goods through airport security and how many have done it intentionally .
it is no surprise that people who know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly carry smu@@ g@@ gled goods - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - are those who fly most frequently .
&quot; however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using . &quot;
people are often unsure which liquids they may take with you or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the largest amount of items confis@@ cated by the T@@ SA are forbidden liquids .
&quot; for a while , people thought that T@@ SA could watch books as smu@@ g@@ gling goods . &quot;
&quot; liquids are permitted on domestic flights , but not on international flights . &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t care : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel order
electric @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k likes to deal with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , he has so far under@@ lined that a part of the customer has already re@@ trac@@ ted its non @-@ binding reservation . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the consistently triumph@@ ant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k will first reveal a different , less brilliant number for the first time in announ@@ cing the latest quarterly balance sheet : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in the past few months , Mus@@ k often had hired more than 500,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery just started . &quot;
&quot; now Mus@@ k is clearing : 6@@ 3,000 have already been withdrawn from the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 orders . &quot;
critics repeatedly pointed out that it is merely a non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la will pay the 1000 Euro ( in the USA 1000 US dollars and in the United Kingdom 1000 pounds ) &quot; &quot; reservation payment &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; at the moment 45@@ ,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations require , in a telephone conference with analysts . &quot;
&quot; however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of about twelve per cent of all orders could become a problem . &quot;
&quot; its argument : the challenge for ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side . &quot;
&quot; last year , Tes@@ la supplied 8@@ 4,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; in 2018 , all models should be combined - 500,000 will be one million by 2020 . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , 1800 bookings are made per day . &quot;
&quot; if you order a &quot; Model 3 , &quot; you can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tes@@ la manages to drive its brand new production lines never before in practice with maximum capacity utilization . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; but if there are too much delays , the liability of the reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
because then the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running away in dro@@ ves .
EPA chief P@@ ru@@ itt moves back to reduce emissions because of dela@@ ying the rules of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a
&quot; a day after he had been su@@ ed by 15 countries , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , Chief of the Environment Agency , took his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the changes when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint filed against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
&quot; it is about a period that ran for States on October 1 , in order to comply with the standards of O@@ O@@ zone in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in June , P@@ ru@@ itt announced that he would delay adher@@ ence over one year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; interfer@@ ing with local decisions or hin@@ dering economic growth . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was Prosecutor of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a before being appointed by President Donald Tr@@ ump , was a reliable opponent of rigorous environmental regulations for a long time . &quot;
&quot; since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly passed on blocking or dela@@ ying regulations to which the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels have resist@@ ed . &quot;
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ p regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
&quot; last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ al in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator exceeded its authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration that committed oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane emissions . &quot;
&quot; in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt proposed that his revers@@ al in o@@ zone standards simply rein@@ forces the willingness of the EPA to co @-@ operate with the States through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards . &quot;
&quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA often failed to comply with the deadlines for carrying out and then to be accused of being accused by activists and others , and in an agreement reached the date for execution , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who su@@ ed the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation through judicial proceedings , and we take fri@@ ght seriously . &quot;
we also take the law and authority that gives us serious .
&quot; nevertheless , the opinion of the EPA said that eventually P@@ ru@@ itt will use its &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available powers to ensure that the rules &quot; are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive new constitution of the O@@ zone rules .
a bill approved last month should delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure has not yet been set up in the Senate .

Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
&quot; 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday , July 16 , will be invited to a Ser@@ en@@ ade at 4.@@ 30 p.@@ m . &quot;
&quot; whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historical St. Hil@@ arius facility is a popular place to stay . &quot;
visitors to the sixth Bene@@ fi@@ z seren@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and supporters of Tum@@ lin@@ gens their concern .
Walter Mart@@ ini stresses : &quot; it is a unique village jewel . &quot;
&quot; in 12@@ 67 St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in documents in the Württem@@ berg@@ ischer &apos;s original customer book : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the parish church to Tum@@ lingen , together with the Vo@@ g@@ t@@ ei &quot; at Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver . &quot;
&quot; according to the wording of the document , there was also a beautiful courtyard where the church or the pat@@ ron@@ age belonged , and not the other way round . &quot;
so there were also people there .
&quot; as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ te Freu@@ den@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , there was beside the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible today in the village of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the dominant sett@@ ler centre of the village . &quot;
old maps from the time around the year 1600 confirm this historical situation .
the pat@@ ron@@ age was originated from the early medieval church law .
&quot; a gentle@@ man who built a church and occupied himself with a priest remained the owner of this church , and could also inher@@ it this church . &quot;
the right to appoint a pastor or to propose a new priest to the bishop was related there@@ to .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the size of the two sh@@ red@@ ded on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly created bell rang for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but later it had to be handed in during the Second World War in 1942 . &quot;
&quot; during the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) , the window pan@@ es were ham@@ mer@@ ed and the bel@@ fry were stolen . &quot;
the roof was leak@@ y .
&quot; in 17@@ 96 , French troops were camp@@ ed near the church . &quot;
they broke out the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened to fall in 18@@ 09 .
&quot; until 18@@ 69 , the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler . &quot;
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the church of Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demol@@ ished .
only the church tower was left standing .
&quot; in the New Year &apos;s Eve 18@@ 34 , a storm split the steep@@ le and half fell . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demol@@ ished . &quot;
only the tower still existing today remained as a witness of the 750 year old church history .
&quot; today , Horst K@@ all@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em are cultiv@@ ating the Hil@@ arius facility by Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn as successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn . &quot;
&quot; the organizers invite friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ lin@@ gen on Sunday , July 16 , to the sixth seren@@ ade on the old cemetery to St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle . &quot;
this is designed by the Com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler High School of Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with contributions by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
&quot; Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann , the local leader , speaks the closing word . &quot;
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.@@ m .
admission is from 15.@@ 30 .
&quot; to conclude the seren@@ ade , a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery . &quot;
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to forest , &quot; the organisers put out the fantastic views . &quot;
the seren@@ ade only takes place in dry weather .
the organizers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historical St. Hil@@ arius facility that is of importance for Tum@@ lingen and Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ lin@@ gens feel particularly committed to home care such as ser@@ en@@ ade organizer Walter Mart@@ ini .
association wants to allow approval of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim resist@@ s &quot; &quot; sees no legal requirements for the construction and has therefore turned to the Coun@@ cill@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the association &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim forbi@@ ds &quot; &quot; has prompted Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to take back his permit for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot;
it is un@@ lawful .
&quot; the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved , since at that time in Vier@@ sen , there was only a wind power concentration zone at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal . &quot;
&quot; within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes an exclusion of wind energy utilization for the rest of the city . &quot;
such zones are intended to prevent a &quot; spar@@ ing &quot; of the landscape .
&quot; the city of Vier@@ sen had decided to change a second wind power concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette a few days earlier , but it did not approve the district government of Düsseldorf , because of a mold failure . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of planning law , the granted approval process is still un@@ lawful and therefore also to be taken back , &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , chairman of &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; current state of affairs : before the summer break , the city council again decided the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette ; a permit from the district government still stands . &quot;
&quot; thus , the granting of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is excluded from planning law . &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the request .
&quot; the corresponding writings have been received from the circle of Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; said a spokesman . &quot;
the circle takes them to examine the matter again .
&quot; however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped . &quot;
&quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to comment on the argum@@ entation of the &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; association . &quot;
&quot; the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , is planning to build four , 200 @-@ metre @-@ high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot;
&quot; last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen was indirectly involved , had closed lease agreements with the owner of the property of about 65 hectares . &quot;
&quot; with the construction of the four wind turbines , electricity needs to be covered by some 11 400 households - roughly one fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ leg@@ ged households . &quot;
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
&quot; last summer , Vier@@ sen gave the green light to purchase three wind turbines at the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind farm near Aachen , as well as a participation in a wind turbine in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in Hein@@ sberg district . &quot;
car and tractor crash together : woman dies with terrible accident
a terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 o &apos;clock on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn circle ) .
a woman was wounded .
two more people were injured .
the provincial road was closed for hours .
&quot; according to police reports , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch took the L 3@@ 33 in the direction of Bo@@ gel with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as a companion . &quot;
city and merchants plan &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ a@@ er and people from the region are to re@@ discover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September .
the commercial association and the municipal administration intend to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract the inhabitants to the city centre .
&quot; as the Chairman of the Trade Association , Christian König , announced that the &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend will sensi@@ ti@@ ze customers to what offers their own city holds away from the usual supermarket goods . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market . &quot;
&quot; in addition , local companies should present themselves with their training places . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre invite to &quot; &quot; midnight @-@ shopping &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the closer region . &quot;
&quot; in preparation are commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend , so Christian König . &quot;
municipal administration and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
&quot; thus , the commercial association and the city enter into another stage of the project &quot; Attrac@@ tive downtown . &quot; &quot;
&quot; these include new offerings such as the first &quot; Active Day &quot; to the well @-@ established Sunday , talks with all the business@@ men and hosts to move them to active participation . &quot;
attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees this day are part of the concept .
&quot; in addition , customer potentials should be re @-@ opened or re @-@ opened . &quot;
these include spa guests and tourists .
but many locals also lost sight of the inner city while shopping .
&quot; in the end , everyone would have to contribute to revi@@ ving the city centre - to land@@ lords , the factories of the whole city and clubs . &quot;
&quot; it was necessary to overcome le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network that was partly wider , König had said in the spring . &quot;
&quot; Bir@@ git St@@ reich , Head of the Chamber of Industry in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , announced that the third &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; day , five Thür@@ inger cities , took part in the country &apos;s third &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; day . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and Blei@@ cher@@ ode . &quot;
&quot; the day should promote the appreciation of local trade and make it more important for the common good of our cities , &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot;
the action led by the Chamber of Commerce of the Chamber of Industry and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his / her own business in a direct environment .
two dead and several injured after explosion at US school
during construction there was a gas explosion in the school building .
new people were injured .
&quot; in a gas explosion in the U.S. town of Min@@ ne@@ apolis , two people were killed and nine others were injured , some of them hard . &quot;
&quot; according to the fire bri@@ gade , Wednesday ( local time ) was still a last in critical condition . &quot;
a man died when a part of a school building collap@@ sed in the explosion .
a first missing one later was also found dead .
the dead were employees of the school .
&quot; as a matter of luck , the authorities suspected works on a gas pipeline . &quot;
only a few people were staying in the Min@@ neh@@ aha Academy building during the holiday season .
Tr@@ ump set out after penet@@ rating tran@@ scripts of phone call Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scription of phone calls between U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
&quot; on 27 January , Tr@@ ump in a telephone conversation with Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to announced that he would not pay for a planned border wall . &quot;
&quot; the US president insul@@ ted him because he publicly denoun@@ ced the Wall . according to reports , he said to him , &quot; &quot; You cannot tell the press . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and sw@@ ung to let Mexico pay for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump told Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the United States would be &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was convey@@ ed by the Obama administration would look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; following a ban on the reloc@@ ation of refugees to the United States . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call after he had said Mr Turn@@ bull , &quot; &quot; this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ore Ford massacre : activists lead rac@@ ist ly@@ n@@ ching act as a call for justice
&quot; a 1948 @-@ he Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of spectators in Mon@@ ro@@ e , Georgia , to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver reaching the bridge , a group of white men came out with ri@@ fl@@ es to block his way . &quot;
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a middle aged man in a con@@ i@@ fer strip - took a long train on his ci@@ gar and looked at the wind@@ shield .
in@@ doors the occup@@ ants ho@@ ver in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; the man ro@@ ared .
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
&quot; the cry broke the silence , when a young black man was dra@@ gged from the passenger seat . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , this horrible scene , which was played on July 22nd , is just a post . &quot;
&quot; but when a loop around the neck of &quot; Roger &quot; is thrown , almost all of the audience met very real si@@ ghs . &quot;
&quot; since 2005 , citizens rights activists go back to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night where two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ oth@@ y Mal@@ com , as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - have been syn@@ ched by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 . &quot;
no one has ever been charged with murder .
&quot; it is truly in@@ conceivable that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our churches , although we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who assi@@ sts in organizing sur@@ rendering . &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt stain on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gres@@ sman of the state Georgia and a life @-@ long citizen .
&quot; for him , Nach@@ stellung serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ ro@@ e community that a wrong has never been corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want criminal prosecution , we want to end , we want cure , we want reconciliation , but first we must get justice , &quot; he said . &quot;
we cannot reach healing and reconciliation until we receive justice .
a for@@ en@@ sic doctor lays a blanket on the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ching on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to FBI files , which were received by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ ro@@ e and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected of the ly@@ n@@ ching process . &quot;
but no one has ever been indic@@ ted .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects remain free on foot for decades , citizens say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice enabled the black citizens to vote their vote in Georgia for the first time . &quot;
&quot; approximately at the same time as the election st@@ ach according to the FBI &apos;s black colour gam@@ eke@@ eper Roger Mal@@ com killed a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman . &quot;
Broo@@ ks said that rum@@ ours in the city had been that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ oth@@ y and that the baby carrying her did not stem from her husband .
&quot; on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white Land@@ owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , the FBI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ oth@@ y and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
&quot; but when they went away from the prison and approaching the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b ring@@ ed the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison who prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; concludes an FBI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , evi@@ den@@ ced evidence and disgu@@ ised the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Broo@@ ks makes it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; it was an electoral law massacre , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; if you register and if you vote , then this will happen to you . &quot;
&quot; for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has directed the annual reproduction of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de . &quot;
&quot; their representation is vivid , gri@@ pping , and is based on a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe that he no longer exists in America . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to watch , and even more difficult to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point . &quot;
&quot; we do not want to talk about the ly@@ n@@ ching because we are confronted with its ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; she said . &quot;
but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I &apos;ve done .
&quot; the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen wh@@ ites and the rest - crowded into a room and listened as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ dan@@ gh is here Gre@@ ene Co @-@ Director .
&quot; he has played the role of Chief C@@ lan@@ member for many years , but he said that the role will never be easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ dan@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; but I think it is very important to keep this story alive , because we do not want to return to these times . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the room , actor Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the ester cries out and p@@ ushes him , fur@@ ious that he slept with his wife Dor@@ oth@@ y . &quot;
&quot; I said , n --- he , win@@ ch away from my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona reci@@ proc@@ ates the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone breaks ( at least all black actors ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; said Ras@@ cona . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; Gre@@ ene said , still ti@@ cking . &quot;
I just don &apos;t think white people at that time &apos; n --- he &apos; said .
&quot; but &quot; , &quot; one of the other black performers . &quot;
&quot; you just have to meet the hard &quot; &quot; R. &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and exactly there the energy shifts in space , a feeling of compan@@ ion@@ ship replaces the discomfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy getting this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene starts again .
&quot; this time , when Ras@@ nov says the N @-@ word , he says it sharp and with im@@ print . &quot;
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends viol@@ ently and quickly .
&quot; there are cries , shots , and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman clothed with mourning , stands over the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and introduces Bil@@ lie Holidays &quot; &quot; St@@ range Fruit &quot; . &quot; &quot;
her voice breaks in every second word .
&quot; about a hundred metres behind it , a group of about four dozens of spectators wi@@ pes sweat and tears from the eyes . &quot;
the audience is almost uni@@ form@@ ly divided between black and white .
&quot; a couple came from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down just the street . &quot;
they have experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as oppres@@ sive moisture for almost eight hours when Broo@@ ks takes her on a pilgrimage to the burial sites of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
&quot; up to this point the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when you stand on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feels gh@@ ost@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and insp@@ ect the cor@@ pse . &quot;
&quot; children ho@@ ck at their heads , register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whis@@ per each other . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; mur@@ m@@ urs a little boy as if he wanted to remember . &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thank@@ ed the crowd - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors throw away the ly@@ n@@ ching rope and wipe off their tears .
&quot; Brad@@ sha@@ w hu@@ gged Mar@@ dan@@ gh , the man in the suit , who played the clan member . &quot;
Nick Ras@@ cona embra@@ ces two of his fellow players and then breaks in her arms weeping ; the emotional load of the performance finally breaks through him .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you have done it for a reason . &quot;
&quot; later , the audience with the actors sit together for dinner . &quot;
&quot; at one table , a white pair of Atlanta ch@@ ats about the post@@ age with a black pair , which they just got to know . &quot;
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky was struggling to find words that had left the performance .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and they do that , because they look like you , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the ly@@ n@@ ching still goes on , &quot; she added , &quot; today it is called police sho@@ ot@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; in the same room , Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks is holding yard at his table , eating and remember@@ ing civil rights . &quot;
he said he started planning the performance next year .
&quot; the post is inspiring in a way because it describes the horror of what we endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is so , if we don &apos;t learn anything from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dä@@ mmerung &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bay@@ reuth
&quot; also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf sits on a colorful and fri@@ vol@@ ous production in front of a giant , six @-@ stor@@ ey@@ ed setting . &quot;
&quot; the turn@@ table ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows a sh@@ aded street corner with Mauer@@ rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and Ela@@ ston &quot; logo from the GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; in front of it , an open Mercedes classic car , in which the Rhine @-@ s@@ cars pose as rock energies , or alternatively a Is@@ etta . &quot;
&quot; stack@@ ed oil barrels remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs leit@@ motif - money , power and greed - which is moving through its &quot; &quot; Ring &quot; &quot; production . &quot;
&quot; the three Rhine @-@ daughters - sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ize as already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold . &quot; &quot;
&quot; K@@ ESS seduc@@ es Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , inv@@ enting a body in the trunk of Hollywood @-@ Man@@ ier and enter the Kra@@ wall@@ o @-@ Cli@@ que . &quot;
Stephen M@@ illing sings the wonderfully fi@@ esen Hagen surrounding the aura of a heavy @-@ weight box@@ ers .
brut@@ ally the scene when he was a Siegfried .
&quot; later , Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) still needs to believe in it . &quot;
the audience thank@@ ed the ensemble with powerful applause .
&quot; Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , who mo@@ dest@@ ly bowed their hands to Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te , are celebrated stor@@ my . &quot;
&quot; there are big applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat back in casual leisure clothes . &quot;
the performance of Frank Cast@@ orf and his team had been anticipated with excitement .
&quot; in 2013 he had still had to leave a cell of the pipe conc@@ erto , five years later , in which the isolated &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; calls went down . &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have rejo@@ iced .
&quot; one notices that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; Ring &quot; , &quot; she had said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot;
&quot; the audience did not only have a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it was also an understanding of the point of view . &quot;
I draw a positive ré@@ sum@@ é .
Max Quanti@@ ty works as a volunteer
they work in several places in their volunteer year .
where to find everywhere ?
&quot; quantity : usually in straw in the furniture fair , once a week , I help here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge . &quot;
and I have also worked in the open full day at school .
what are your experiences with it ?
&quot; quantity : it is a beautiful , broad spectrum that I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ time volunteer . &quot;
how does this come about ?
quantity : I did Ab@@ itur .
&quot; and then a civil engineer , let &apos;s say , successfully cancelled . &quot;
&quot; for me , I realized that it &apos;s the wrong thing for me and I want to do something different , working with people . &quot;
and then I asked myself what are you doing .
&quot; a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , in the focal point maybe , really is . &quot;
and was it so ?
quantity : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in social welfare in the winter semester .
&quot; I will study dual , I am likely to have a social worker training and study in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences in Ham@@ m . &quot;
isn &apos;t it unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service ?
&quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
it always depends on where you are doing his FS@@ J .
one can make it from the old people &apos;s home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .
it was very varied with me .
&quot; I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care . &quot;
for me it was just the right thing that appe@@ aled to me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really works .
different than in civil engineering studies ?
&quot; a lot : well , it &apos;s not about calcul@@ ating St@@ ati@@ ks here . &quot;
&quot; one always has other people in front of the head , each having a completely different story behind each other . &quot;
whether a refugee or a youth who has been brought out of the family - you always have to deal with them individually .
very interesting .
and you didn &apos;t have any reservations ?
&quot; quantity : for this , I am not the guy . &quot;
there is an area that gives a lot .
&quot; lots of love , lots of kindness . &quot;
&quot; there are also negative moments , but life is like that . &quot;
Pear@@ son cuts further 3.000 jobs and cuts divi@@ den@@ ds to revi@@ ve business
&quot; British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday that it will reduce further 3,000 jobs and shor@@ ten its interim dividend by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressures the company faces . &quot;
&quot; the job reductions announced by CEO John Fall@@ on mainly for the end of 2018 and early 2019 will be added to its previous restructuring , where 4,000 jobs have already been lost . &quot;
&quot; Pear@@ son announced in May a third cost cutting program a cost reduction plan by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a business , which was hit by the rapid pace to digital learning . &quot;
&quot; the company , which last month expressed its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to the partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged , after having achieved an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year . &quot;
Kab@@ ul con@@ voy : NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
&quot; a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in Kab@@ ul , the Afgh@@ an capital , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , say officials . &quot;
&quot; five soldiers and an interpreter had been viol@@ ated , divided Nato &apos;s declaration . &quot;
&quot; according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians died in the case of the incident in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district . &quot;
the bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan has hit this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at on Tuesday .
&quot; on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul . &quot;
&quot; in a NATO statement , the explosion on Thursday evening was to be seen as a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; impro@@ vised explosive &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all injuries are in a stable state and are treated at the US military hospital on the B@@ agra@@ m air@@ field .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ es@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby B@@ agra@@ m .
&quot; according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital . &quot;
&quot; at the end of July , a suicide bomb killed at least 30 people in a predominantly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul . &quot;
the Taliban said they had done this attack .
&quot; on May 31 , a massive bombing in the city centre killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack in the country , since the US @-@ led troops pushed the Taliban away from power in 2001 . &quot;
&quot; violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump sums up the number of U.S. troops supporting military and police in the country . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the suicide rate in Kab@@ ul in recent weeks also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , its policies and , in particular , the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani . &quot;
EPA returns decision to delay smo@@ g rule to suits
&quot; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a decision to delay regulation of the Obama administration , repe@@ aled that states are obliged to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this took place a day after 15 states su@@ ed the agency because of the step . &quot;
&quot; the EPA late on Wednesday announced the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; O@@ zone Reg@@ ulations 2015 &quot; &quot; and said it is showing the agency &apos;s commitment to cooperate with States . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and by responding to our state partners , &quot; said EPA chief Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; in June , P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the EPA &apos;s intention to determine the o@@ zone provisions - in which contam@@ in@@ ant emissions are to be measured in a part of the country to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year until October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 largely democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to drive a wide range of environmental issues imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda , which is supposed to boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; however , efforts have triggered the set@@ backs of the Democrats and nature conservation groups who are worried about the impact of greater emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the EPA &apos;s website says that inhal@@ ing air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; &quot; reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; such as asthma . &quot;
municipal council wants common room
&quot; in the end , the decision was clear : in two opposing voices , the municipal council of Flu@@ orn Win@@ tz@@ els decides to set up a common room in the future senior residence . &quot;
&quot; before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing part of the site was signed , reports mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; although it will still take a while until the church community has been owned by the church , there is now no planning obstacle to the project stem@@ ming from a private investor . &quot;
there is a discussion about a common area .
one of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
&quot; on the ground floor , it would make living space - some 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with an area of 70 square meters for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the administration and the majority of the municipal council are floating in front of such a common area not to be seen as a meeting place for the residents of the sen@@ iors @-@ just living , but openly in the church . &quot;
&quot; for example , the word from &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot;
the decision made by the provision of funds for the current budget will be made by funding opportunities last autumn .
the building is in the refurb@@ ishment area .
&quot; the establishment of a common room would be , so T@@ j@@ aden reports , with 60 percent of 30 percent eligible . &quot;
&quot; the decision is to signal the investor , that in this respect it is not possible to throw a bil@@ let between the legs , stating that both saddle - which is le@@ aning against the surrounding environment - as well as the roof @-@ roof - which reduces the tr@@ ump height and makes the construction more economical - possible . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less to say , Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer doesn &apos;t mean this addition . &quot;
&quot; if it helps : unanim@@ ously , he passes the committee . &quot;
it is not as easy as the common room .
&quot; Daniela &apos;s reputation refers to the many own buildings , with which one can &apos;t move so much , but now we lean on the communal room from the window , she says : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m hard with it . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger is definitely talking about the common room - but absolutely against a communal participation .
it sees behind it a cover@@ t subsi@@ dy to already wealthy or even foreign investors .
&quot; this is not the case , because with the purchase of the surface there is no grant , but will receive a real equivalent , which is market@@ able in doubt , is the counter @-@ speech . &quot;
&quot; Sta@@ ig@@ er &apos;s request to split the resolution accordingly , finds three pro@@ pon@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; so it remains with two opposing voices in the original program , which Stefan H@@ aller sum@@ mar@@ ises : &quot; when we grasp the decision , we make a giant leap to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;
collision with car : cycl@@ ist is scre@@ wed onto the road
&quot; when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist was captured by a car on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath and severely injured . &quot;
&quot; as the police announced , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the road from the road Schwar@@ zer Weg to Hil@@ den on the bike path of the road Schwar@@ zer Weg . &quot;
the senior wanted to cross the road in the height of the street Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car leader in the same direction granted him priority .
&quot; when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder went to the road , he obviously did not pay attention to the counter @-@ traffic . &quot;
he met with a car that contributed a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ erin .
the man was thrown into the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was brought to a hospital with a retreat car .
FC Bayern Munich has to miss Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund &apos;s Super@@ cup at David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without it : David Al@@ aba must leave the game against Dortmund .
&quot; with personnel management , the FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory match for the new season . &quot;
seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the Cup winner .
the personnel managers at the German football record master Bayern Munich are getting bigger in front of the Super@@ cup Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 hrs / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti does not have to do without the B@@ V@@ B on David Al@@ aba .
this was confirmed by the Italian on Friday .
&quot; in addition , the mou@@ ths of Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing . &quot;
&quot; for the five defe@@ ats over the past six trials , An@@ cel@@ otti is responsible for the physical condition and the missing balance in the game of his team . &quot;
&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti : &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot;
&quot; last but not least , that was not good . &quot;
&quot; however , the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory game of the season . &quot;
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot;
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the crew is ready .
&quot; we want to play intelligent , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who is expecting a &quot; difficult , intense game . &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights attracts the fans .
&quot; the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , distributed the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday . &quot;
hike in the Har@@ z from Star to Star
&quot; in Har@@ z , the country &apos;s first &quot; &quot; star trail &quot; &quot; is to be created . &quot;
this is planned by the association &quot; Stern@@ warte Sankt Andreas Andre@@ as@@ berg . &quot;
there is a planet trail in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; star trail &quot; &quot; comes to meet the needs of many visitors of the har@@ lot visitors . &quot;
&quot; he connects nature , science , movement and athletic performance . &quot;
the members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; in the first phase of 2018 , the association is planning &quot; &quot; well at@@ tain@@ able installations in five to six locations &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; question : St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ sel and Si@@ eber . &quot;
the information on the boards is to be added via the Internet .
&quot; for this reason , a good mobile network reception is important when selecting a location . &quot;
accessibility is also a criterion .
&quot; later , the Star Path train will be extended by train . &quot;
&quot; on the star trail , the viewers experience a lot of knowledge , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; the association explained . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star is more light than another , although it is considerably farther away . &quot;
&quot; also , in which con@@ stellation a selected star can be found and when it is best to see . &quot;
the association has been running the highest observ@@ atory in northern Germany since 2014 in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg .
&quot; according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the location in the middle of the Har@@ z National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany . &quot;
frequently from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a gal@@ axy with naked eye can be seen clearly .
&quot; in the university town since 2003 , there is something similar to the Plan@@ etary Trail on the initiative of the Förder@@ verein planet@@ arium Göttingen . &quot;
&quot; starting at Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet trail leads up to Ha@@ in@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the d@@ warf @-@ plan@@ ed down @-@ down Plu@@ to at the end point - are positioned exactly at the distance and the scale of one to two billion .
&quot; the earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the sun exactly 75 metres away measures 70 centimet@@ ers . &quot;
the entire distance of the planet is about four kilometres .
&quot; while the light from sun to Plu@@ to requires about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour up to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to . &quot;
so pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos .
&quot; the march to the next fix , however , would last half a year . &quot;
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time discussing a possible show@@ down
&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were supposed to stand in a collision course in order to stage the most exciting fight for boxing in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council light weight champion , went down the hall to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing organization Super fe@@ ather weight champion . &quot;
&quot; after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous decision on the former Four @-@ Di@@ visions World Champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both comb@@ at@@ ants are members of the Top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ List . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out the right hand and said , &quot; &quot; How are you , Champion ? &quot;
I wish you a lot of luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 pm on ES@@ PN .
&quot; as the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas noted that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a former fe@@ ather weight , &quot; &quot; recalls Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; I went up for Bron@@ er &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I am not so great . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I &apos;d like to run down on lightweight .
and he must move to light weight @-@ weights &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that is what the fans demand .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxes need this fight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Kli@@ mas asked if it should be pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 pound debut this year to arrange a date in the next summer with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) , also interested in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell in the forum on September 23 . &quot;
&quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all fans asked him , &quot; Gar@@ cia said , and later expressed himself openly to fight with the network that offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said he treasures Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he will possibly take part in his Saturday battle . &quot;
&quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held a generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said he thinks , the triple battle champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side looks very slowly , sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted the co @-@ off . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show impact , then boxes . &quot;
both said they could feel the momentum that arose for their own struggle .
this is the struggle that needs to be carried out .
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; Gar@@ cia said . &quot;
&quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been waiting for the top warri@@ ors , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot;
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four injured in tire plat@@ ters
&quot; in an accident at the A@@ 7 , four people were severely injured in the afternoon on Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; after the first information , the driver of an Opel Za@@ fir@@ a lost control of his vehicle shortly before the junction of the market . &quot;
&quot; the car slow@@ ed down to the right into the bu@@ ck , where he over@@ turned and then remained on the roof in the green stri@@ pe . &quot;
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were severely injured in the accident .
&quot; during the first delivery of the rescue service , the A@@ 7 was locked in the direction north for about an hour , and the traffic on the left @-@ hand lane could be passed by the accident site . &quot;
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; three chain works better &quot;
&quot; after 2 : 2 , Andr@@ e Hoffmann hopes for the start of the season against Braunschweig , that optimi@@ zing the defense formation in Au@@ e points . &quot;
&quot; with the first season of the season , Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , too , wouldn &apos;t be the two opponents at 2 : 2 against Br@@ uns@@ wick . &quot;
&quot; these were two opponents too much , and we have to watch out even better in Au@@ e , &quot; says the def@@ enders of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; in the Or@@ e Mountains , the three @-@ chain is to be further optimized . &quot;
and the For@@ tun@@ as don &apos;t want to catch a gate after an offensive .
&quot; for the future , it will be so that no one stands next to Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) . &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that after the experience in preparation with the three chain his team is better able to cope better than with the four chain .
&quot; I don &apos;t know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is convinced of his cause , &quot; because we have just been in the three chain on the half positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ aan and Ni@@ ko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build up well , &quot; Hoffmann said . &quot;
&quot; the prerequisite is , however , that we are still better harmon@@ izing and we don &apos;t afford such a lot of playing mistakes . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann goes to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; but whether you can talk about a failed start , you don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; Hoffmann said . &quot;
&quot; but if we are at four points on Sunday and can concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to talk about a decent season op@@ ener . &quot;
his trainer wanted to know nothing about it .
&quot; the start into the season I judged only after six to eight days , &quot; &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who did not want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e , only because the game of Sax@@ onia in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be stopped early because of a thunder@@ storm . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season virtually with a home game , &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , that the players from Au@@ e might even be a bit fres@@ her , as they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a promotion favorite in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t know so 100 % where they are at the moment , &quot; says the def@@ enders of Fort@@ una . &quot;
although the guests from the Rhin@@ eland go as a light favorite on Sunday in the encounter at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; that we sweep it away , just because we are entitled to come under the first six , is non@@ sense , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive with only a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , which you must hit from the start , &quot; says For@@ tun@@ as Chief coach . &quot;
to make such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t .
&quot; and so , funk does not want to experience his players on Sunday . &quot;
new results of Swedish asylum application tests published
recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden who have undergone a new method for medical evaluation of their age show that more than 80 percent of the tested individuals are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authorities for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( medic@@ ament@@ als medic@@ inal@@ isation ) began the tests last year .
&quot; during the asylum process , they should make the assessment of age more precise after the Swedish Migration Service ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) critic@@ ised for the assessment of the correct age of some refugees who were minor . &quot;
&quot; until today , migration sales have sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were evaluated as 18 or older while in another 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person was &quot; possibly under 18 years old . &quot;
the tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are consistent over the past few months . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; he said to the magazine The Local . &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person was judged more than 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seekers have lied about his age .
&quot; in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases suggest@@ ing that the subordin@@ ated person is 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det examined the 5@@ 81 published results , it noted that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had said openly that it will be 18 years old this year . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical age assessment , during which x @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints are made , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , was also critici@@ zed in some areas . &quot;
a skep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute whose work involves assessing the biological maturity of humans to see if they were earlier or later than usual by pu@@ ber@@ ty .
I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think that the type of measurement should be used .
judging the biological age in this way is very uncertain .
&quot; if we can &apos;t say it safe , we should not do as if we could , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of being in@@ correctly assessing a child as an adult is low . &quot;
&quot; the greatest risk is when the person is just under 18 , in this case this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in the plan
the works on the three bridges of the road 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
&quot; on Wednesday , a seven @-@ ton@@ ne concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; we are very good at the time , it &apos;s going great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , head of construction at the Department of Road Engineering and Transport in the Pres@@ i@@ dency of Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April , the work began at the same time on all three need for rehabilitation between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
the end of the building is scheduled for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule is respected .
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is an arch bridge made of concrete , which is covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 metres . &quot;
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; like the two other bridges , too , it has now come into the years . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated . &quot;
the other two bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 meters long . &quot;
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach on Wednesday morning on the north side had a 1.@@ 30m wide and seven tons weight so @-@ called bridge cap .
this is a border fixing that is also used as an operating path .
at the southern part of the bridge a 2.@@ 20 meter wide bridge should be used on Friday .
then the pedestrian path is to run .
&quot; the special thing is that they are finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger Company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges have already been fitted with the patented bridge caps .
special finger@@ tip sensitivity has demanded the laying of cables through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable to which many companies are connected .
the residents were informed in advance of the work by hand@@ books on the project .
fish and cra@@ y@@ fish first had to be f@@ ished .
&quot; for the bridges between the building yard building and the collecting pond in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated by a traffic light . &quot;
&quot; for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach village entrance , the street in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Si@@ eben Lin@@ den &quot; is fully closed . &quot;
&quot; the costs for the three frac@@ tions of the bridge amount to 700@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the whole thing is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ unter Protest at German potato salad
&quot; it is not so common that parties pull together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which is otherwise hard to put under a hat . &quot;
&quot; the parties represented in the District Day ( CD@@ U , SPD , Gre@@ ens , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) belong to a broad alliance that shows a peaceful flag on that day because the Af@@ D is invited to the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle in R@@ ond@@ ell , according to the poster &quot; &quot; Great Elec@@ toral Campa@@ ign Stru@@ ggle &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and well @-@ known names start - like Alice Wei@@ der , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the Vice @-@ President Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; but those who are on site before the start of the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ D developers , but demonstrate . &quot;
the motto &quot; The Ei@@ fel is colourful . &quot;
&quot; originally the city @-@ picnic under the motto &quot; &quot; All at one table &quot; &quot; was planned on the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but now takes place on the parking lot below the gon@@ dol@@ a - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D @-@ Event in the Stad@@ thalle . &quot;
a colourful picture that is there .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chair@@ woman of the Forum A World and one of the leading organizers , really pleased : &quot; great , how many people came together here . &quot;
&quot; there is music and lots of food , including an &quot; &quot; German potato salad , which the Af@@ D can eat without any problems , &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot;
&quot; police has ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing presence especially at the train station , which is only a few metres away from the venues . &quot;
how did the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes of the Af@@ D volcano Ei@@ fel region reports that he stri@@ ves for such an event and received the supplement .
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us kir@@ mes there were not enough parking spaces available . &quot;

tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
&quot; a re@@ union with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is available in the series Has@@ la@@ cher Kloster@@ concer@@ tos tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 pm in the monastery church . &quot;
&quot; together with Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; meets a classical German training with roots in brass music . &quot;
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have pinn@@ ed solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
thus Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is solo trumpet player of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
&quot; both unite the desire to not only cross borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres . &quot;
&quot; Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like a new garment , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &apos;s &quot; world music &quot; unites with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz pianist N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classical , jazz and the free play mix together into a fascinating total art@@ works . &quot;
this core of the program was first performed this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram has written it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher Klo@@ sterk@@ irche with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously integrated into the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their life .
&quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; said Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart openly about her bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; when I bite into grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the most well @-@ known relationship between Hollywood stars was the &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who finally dealt with bitter@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the brun@@ ette Dar@@ stell@@ erin ass@@ ures the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Ba@@ z@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I &apos;ve been in love with everyone I &apos;ve been collecting . &quot;
&quot; or do you think , I would have played it ? &quot;
&quot; after their separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; I have always lived du@@ alism and believed it seriously . &quot;
so I have never confused or obstruc@@ ted me .
I &apos;ve never liked to be taken seriously .
&quot; she especially suffered from &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; but during the school period when she preferred to dress like a boy : &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
that really hurt me .
&quot; when I was eleven , the children told me that I would look like a boy . &quot;
&quot; I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed . &quot;
&quot; now I look back and think : &apos; girls , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
&quot; especially the public do not like to explain their love life : &quot; people expect you to act in a certain way , and that anno@@ ys me . &quot;
&quot; and perhaps some call me und@@ et@@ ectable , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself from the whole public . &quot;
the Gover@@ nor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
&quot; the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Tr@@ ump that he would change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the demonstration broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; Justice added . &quot;
as a trainer I would say that it &apos;s time to play another game .
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised before a big announcement at the West Virginia Rally .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic nomin@@ ee H@@ illary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; according to For@@ bes , Justice , who is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 . &quot;
For@@ bes notes that he has coal mines in five states and has inherited a coal store by his father .
it is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
&quot; in the meantime , on Thursday evening , the Repub@@ lican National Committee issued an explanation in which it said : &quot; the party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party , which would rather stop us from working to make our country magnificent . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the last rejection of a party which is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive , convincing message , &quot; said the R@@ NC leader Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation to the C@@ BS News . &quot;
&quot; Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; &quot; honest &quot; &quot; Russian excuse for dop@@ ing scandal &quot;
&quot; the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing scandal , but he repeated it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed into the sport again . &quot;
Russian Ath@@ le@@ tics Chef D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the Ath@@ le@@ tics Championships that the exile of his country was correct from sports and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; all athletes , who have been gra@@ bbed in gold and silver med@@ als at competitions . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress approved for the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 , after a report from the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) had found evidence of state @-@ funded dop@@ ing in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open response today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e the re@@ porter . &quot;
the whole Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized by itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed .
Co@@ E said he was also &quot; pleased &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re @-@ introduction .
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think that progress has been made , but Congress supports the Task Force recommendations that this is not the moment to re @-@ use Russia again , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot;
&quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; he added . &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the athle@@ tics world championships that begin on Friday in London according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors .
&quot; the leader of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must meet some of the criteria for re @-@ adjustment . &quot;
&quot; drug tests are still inadequate and forbidden trainers are still working freely , he told re@@ porters in London after a speech at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot;
act of mourning for soldiers cut down in Mali
&quot; during a funeral ceremony in Frit@@ z@@ lar , about 1,000 people of the two killed soldiers with a helicopter crash in Mali . &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security arrangements .
the Minister of Defence Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing to be un@@ explained .
&quot; she described the two conver@@ gent drivers as &quot; &quot; K@@ ön@@ ner of their professional &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bow to this highest sacrifice , which they provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; she explained . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen had died on Wednesday a week in West African Mali .
her coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and brought on Thursday by a vi@@ gil of the Bundes@@ wehr in the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom Sankt Peter .
&quot; at noon , only the members of the church took leave . &quot;
&quot; after that , the mourning ceremony began in the circle of the family , close friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr as well as politics . &quot;
&quot; among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) , and the Chief In@@ spec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr , Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er . &quot;
&quot; roses laid down roses , the relatives were standing arm in arms at the coff@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; before the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a screen . &quot;
Minister of Defence of the Le@@ yen called the surrounding soldiers as &quot; highly decorated &quot; and en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed .
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann has built up the flight operations of the helicopter Tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tig@@ ers of his regi@@ ment .
&quot; Volker Bau@@ er@@ sa@@ ch , commander of the regi@@ ment to whom the soldiers belonged , declared : &quot; if the crew couldn &apos;t turn away the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot;
&quot; doubt about the UN mission in Mali , Minister of the Le@@ yen did not show : the use was dangerous . &quot;
&quot; but he is also of great importance &quot; for a country from which we are separated only by two states , &quot; she said . &quot;
after the funeral the coff@@ ins were taken out of the cathedral .
&quot; when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information . &quot;
Prince Hen@@ rik does not want a grave beside his wife
&quot; the husband of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death . &quot;
that shared the Royal House on Thursday .
&quot; traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the Ros@@ kil@@ de cathedral church . &quot;
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
the Queen agreed with her husband &apos;s decision and said it was still in the message .
&quot; where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , it is still unclear . &quot;
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
&quot; after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become king . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , he retired and also sets out the title &quot; &quot; princess &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; since Hen@@ rik wrote in Denmark not the title and the function he wanted , he did not see himself as equivalent to his wife - not even after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the chief speaker of the Danish Royal House . &quot;
&quot; where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , be still unclear . &quot;
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he has worked for the last 50 years .
&quot; Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French aristo@@ cratic family , met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London . &quot;
he worked at the Th@@ ames in the French embassy .
&quot; during his later wife , the sympath@@ ies of the people were always fe@@ eb@@ le , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his barely 50 years of rain at the Dan@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik vo@@ iced over the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did was critici@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was vac@@ ill@@ ating , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk str@@ as@@ ms instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smoked in place of Virginia @-@ tobacco and who in this country had the reputation to be the brand of corporate intellectuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be content with this position and not ashamed .
there were two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants rapid re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority , Lower Saxony &apos;s Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is not willing to res@@ ign for a rapid re @-@ election of the country . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , he was speaking for the resolution of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; previously , the sudden withdrawal of a Green Party de@@ pu@@ ties from their state parliament in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis . &quot;
five months before the official date of the state election the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its scar@@ ce one @-@ vote majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the former Green MEP El@@ ke T@@ ester founded her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in her constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover . &quot;
&quot; s &amp; D Group leader , Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler , wants to recommend his group to include them . &quot;
&quot; thus CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Land@@ tag , SPD and Gre@@ ens 68 seats . &quot;
&quot; up to now , the relationship was revers@@ ed . &quot;
the new Land@@ tag will be elected regular on January 14 next year .
&quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler , the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , however , considers it indispensable for the country &apos;s day to resolve its self @-@ resolution as quickly as possible . &quot;
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the state constitution also envis@@ ages the possibility that the parliament &apos;s parliament is dra@@ gging trust and choosing a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; our constitution offers several options . &quot;
&quot; these possibilities must be checked legally , &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; in peace , all questions will be discussed if they are legally tested . &quot;
&quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ West &apos;s step , &quot; &quot; but something strange . &quot;
the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
she described herself as a pendant of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens demanded the de@@ bit@@ ant de@@ pu@@ ties for the return of their State Senate .
&quot; we assume , of course , that she returns her country &apos;s mandate , which she has received over the Green Country List , with immediate effect , &quot; announced the president Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; the president of the Gre@@ ens Anja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ life@@ jacket extraordinary . &quot;
she has deliberately decided not to lead a speech in the Group .
&quot; even in the background that there were no differences in content , we cannot understand this step . &quot;
SPD chan@@ cell@@ or candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transfer of the Lower Saxony @-@ Demo@@ crat MEPs El@@ ke T@@ life@@ jackets to the CD@@ U as treas@@ on .
&quot; the attitude of the former Gre@@ ens in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of the voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; said the chief of the Socialists and Democrats on Facebook on Friday . &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly elect the country &apos;s day .
the Austr@@ itt T@@ v@@ est costs the majority of red @-@ green in Lower Saxony .
&quot; the politi@@ cian &quot; &quot; in her latest vanity and in her fru@@ stration is her personal interests in front of the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised SPD Secretary @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot;
it is a scandal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony makes this dirty tricky game and tries to beat it political capital .
Nieder@@ sachsen &apos;s CD@@ U leader Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his de@@ pu@@ ties to include El@@ ke T@@ life@@ jackets in the CD@@ U .
&quot; the SPD leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , accused T@@ v@@ ests of distor@@ ting the outcome of the 2013 state election with personal car@@ eers . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U was at that time the strongest force , SPD and Gre@@ ens in the parliament , but had a very thin majority in the parliament . &quot;
&quot; agriculture Minister in Interview - How do we protect ourselves from gyp@@ si@@ es , Herr Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany discusses contaminated eggs .
how could the scandal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
&quot; in an interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) , Minister Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) speaks and answers . &quot;
&quot; Mr Schmidt , How can the consumer protect himself from pois@@ oned eggs ? &quot;
I can only encourage all consumers to view the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp print .
&quot; on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states present the latest information on the concerned eggs bat@@ ches . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if , after all we know , a health hazard is practically impossible . &quot;
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the educ@@ ator is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has opened immediately and is in close exchange with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of Germany &apos;s concerns . &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
trade has as well as the manufacturers to ensure that the sold products are market@@ able and harmless to health .
&quot; if the residual sugar level of 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are not traffic @-@ capable . &quot;
un@@ polluted eggs can however be sold and eaten .
this time the factories are not to blame .
do production plants and consumers sit in the same boat ?
&quot; according to the state of knowledge , the production companies do not make immediate debt . &quot;
&quot; rather , they have to expect economic damages based on the presum@@ ed illegal practices of service companies . &quot;
&quot; as always , there is too little control in the harvest . &quot;
is it missing only at the staff or on the conclu@@ sive competence ?
there were just the official controls which have revealed the process .
&quot; however , the truth is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent excluded . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , a consistent education of such events and the transfer to the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases where criminal off@@ ences can be submitted are of decisive importance . &quot;
I have already made it clear that I am expecting a complete enligh@@ tenment from the responsible authorities .
is regular alarm mis@@ m really necessary for food stores ?
consumers have the right to only get safe and transpor@@ table food .
&quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly considered . &quot;
&quot; by means of the sli@@ pped product , manufacturers , dealers and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; in principle , it must be clear that the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food supplying animals is not acceptable and must be stopped immediately . &quot;
it is important to work consistently and with high pressure on all levels .
I expect all competent authorities to ensure that the facts are quickly and comprehen@@ sively informed .
how the financial rules of football on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ imp@@ eded expenses of European football clubs will not interfere with N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfers from Spain to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
&quot; any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from the UEF@@ A , as the leading organization that monitors the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial Fair Play rules , launched in 2011 by the UEF@@ A , mean that PS@@ G has to prove at some point that N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s transfer was financed without major losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million dollars ) to buy the Brazi@@ li@@ ans from their contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
&quot; PS@@ G can safely make the money loose , so that N@@ ey@@ mar will sign and bring him to a gal@@ axy of other stars , in view of the funding of the team by the energy @-@ rich host family of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money for the purchase of players , but they have to counter@@ act them with legitimate income sources enabling them to break even point in their football related business . &quot;
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
&quot; the former French player believed that associations , who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success , effectively che@@ at and ris@@ ked to ruin themselves when banks or owners with@@ drew their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentration on the debts of the clubs to monitor their losses . &quot;
&quot; the change meant that the business model , the Roman Abra@@ movi@@ ch originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to build the team and build a global brand - to become a harder matter . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P expansion period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses amoun@@ ting to 30 million euros . &quot;
&quot; and although Plat@@ ini has fallen away from the Pres@@ i@@ dency in 2015 , his UEF@@ A successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to be deter@@ red by excessive expenses . &quot;
&quot; certainly FF@@ P isn &apos;t dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a l@@ ump sum , it can distribute the amount for accounting for the duration of its contract . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the revenues for the next five years can be reported in the annual financial statements for the next five years . &quot;
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has hit the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G received a fine of € 60 million ( $ 82 million ) , which was later lowered to € 20 million - and it was ordered that the team members for the 2014 / 15 Champions League will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players . &quot;
UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to out@@ wit their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their revenues by companies associated with the owners of a club .
&quot; while a Catalan company could sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not be regarded as legitimate income . &quot;
this was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the P@@ SA sponsor@@ ship was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that some of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come about payments from the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar have argued that N@@ ey@@ mar WM will be am@@ bass@@ adors and one such maneu@@ ver could be easy to find out for the UEF@@ A regulatory authorities .
&quot; the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that UEF@@ A will be even more attentive , to observe any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules . &quot;
&quot; the UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G via N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation . &quot;
they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press because they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
the accounts for the last fiscal year must still be published .
&quot; PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s &apos;s arrival to be a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , merchan@@ dising and jer@@ sey sales . &quot;
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signature .
&quot; the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move by claiming that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the president of the La League , Ja@@ vier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar &apos;s final ownership of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al Manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La League against a state financed by an association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the last 15 years , &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it will be very difficult to respect the financial fair play , because you have different ways or can have different interests if a country has such a big actor to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new shock supplier
in recent years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y has made board chocolate for Swiss .
now the sweet collaboration is coming to an end : the airline is re@@ writing the order .
&quot; on request of the news agency , Swiss @-@ Spe@@ aker Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott confirmed a corresponding report from the newspaper &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; on Friday . &quot;
&quot; according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 . &quot;
the products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the spokesperson . &quot;
around 17 million small red @-@ white wrapped sho@@ cks of 14 grams distribute each year the flight atten@@ d@@ ants from landing to the passengers .
Swiss didn &apos;t want to provide any information about the costs .
sector insi@@ ders estimate the volume of orders according to &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs .
but more important is the advertising effect : for a shock maker it is a prestigious order .
&quot; as many applicants give it to the new tender , Swiss Life doesn &apos;t want to reveal it . &quot;
but only Swiss manufacturers are in question .
&quot; according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the Treaty on Spring 2018 . &quot;
&quot; for the s@@ da , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for a comment . &quot;
&quot; since 2006 , chocolate bars are distributed on board of their flights since 2006 . &quot;
&quot; before the Swiss signed a contract with the Mig@@ ros subsidiary , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut had delivered the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g . &quot;
&quot; the opportunity to place the logo , led Swiss two and a half years ago to start working with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot;
the airline collabor@@ ates with different Swiss chocolate producers .
&quot; on long @-@ haul flights , the First Class customers are spoiled with goo@@ dies from the Con@@ fis@@ erie Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in Business Class wet passengers Scho@@ gg@@ i von Lin@@ dt and in Economy Class Scho@@ gg@@ i by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot;
&quot; also on the short circuit , Swiss Scho@@ gg@@ i is distributed by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in business and Economy Class . &quot;

&quot; this repetition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80s , for the 90 @-@ years @-@ gr@@ unge period ( when the pioneers David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter play the Sk@@ etch @-@ comedy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 before their stars , such as Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd , went to bigger things . &quot;
&quot; as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ enabled era . permanent memories . &quot;
but as a fran@@ chise it feels like time would be scar@@ ce .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not only because of its absurd humour ( it contained an original story for an appealing can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;
&quot; by vent@@ uring onto the core of the g@@ ags - middle @-@ aged actors play hor@@ ny kids , who will grow up - nevertheless they created the im@@ possibility to win back the last part of the te@@ at . &quot;
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with adults who now play adults , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more to the casting principle , among them a reef on the Stal@@ ker movies of the 90 &apos;s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le . &quot; &quot;
&quot; at one point , a character rum@@ bles through an Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the ami@@ able C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Mar@@ ino ) still hasn &apos;t lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
&quot; and there is another crazy @-@ vi@@ cious plot in which Ron@@ ald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) is involved , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good good impression by Michael Ian Black ) . &quot;
&quot; as always , the courses are the best part of the fran@@ chise . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s a lot of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons side@@ burns of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy now feels like an old boy . &quot;
&quot; these are the moments of chance ma@@ dness that could heat this fran@@ chise as a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series , until it reaches what I see as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the band &apos;s premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon is now reminiscent of another kind of nostal@@ gia : to revi@@ ve the Cold War from &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with its East @-@ to @-@ West w@@ rest@@ ling icon@@ ography . &quot;
&quot; the comedy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Aless@@ andro Tan@@ aka is to be a bon@@ ded TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two police officers as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est fighting for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the way of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism . &quot;
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alo@@ gues by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt can be synchron@@ ized in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to watch ( the police sp@@ ends time to watch chess on television as Americans might do with football ) .
&quot; and the list of famous actors - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - ensures a decent game &apos; Fin@@ de the voice out &apos; . &quot;
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so much involved in the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a du@@ bi@@ ous propaganda @-@ drama - a mur@@ derer carrying a Re@@ ag@@ an mask is involved - that it often plays like a single one .
&quot; there are six long episodes , and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , who was reduced to a lesser length , could deliver his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re better , since Greg@@ ory and I@@ os@@ ef always visit the American embassy whose lobby is always occupied by two big men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot;
the message for the imag@@ inary communist audience is that Western culture can do everything for food for a money .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even make it with our own recent history and theirs .
impact on drug ma@@ fia in the country
the police succeeded in beating the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , as the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office told Kon@@ stanz on Friday . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , 15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and already issued arrest warran@@ ts against them . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the officials ensured large amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms as well as several hundred thousand euros . &quot;
two people were arrested at the same time in Italy .
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects .
&quot; therefore , the two are probably extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany . &quot;
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the action .
a total of more than 300 police officers were in use .
&quot; organised drug crimin@@ ality , severe acts of violence , attempted murder as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail were charged to members of the Ma@@ fia . &quot;
&quot; since summer 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office has been investigating the organised drug traffi@@ cking in Southern Germany . &quot;
&quot; between the public prosec@@ utions in Con@@ stance and Palermo , there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the large @-@ scale use on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo . &quot;
especially Italian citizens with close relation to the Italian ma@@ fia were targeted by the investigations .
&quot; also an incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired into a restaurant early in the morning , is likely to go to the account of the gang . &quot;
Weise cla@@ ves large gaps in the for@@ eigner @-@ register
&quot; according to a report , the foreigners register in Germany has considerable short@@ com@@ ings . &quot;
this leads to some serious mis@@ decisions on asylum procedures .
&quot; according to a media report , the Commissioner for Refu@@ gee Management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , drew attention to large gaps in the country &apos;s central register . &quot;
&quot; defici@@ encies in the data recorded there could lead to some serious mis@@ decisions in case of asylum procedures and de@@ port@@ ations , warned in an analysis of the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the statistics , ten million people with foreign nationality are registered in the Register , including 5.@@ 7 million people from non @-@ EU countries . &quot;
the data is therefore administered by approximately 600 country authorities in Germany .
&quot; because the data has not been sufficiently maintained , the data quality in parts has not been good so far . &quot;
&quot; in individual cases , data was found in 1921 , &quot; &quot; by people who are no longer alive , or citizens who have become German citizens and should not appear in the Register any more . &quot;
&quot; faulty data inputs can significantly slow return processes , &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; moreover , in statistics on sufficient people , EU citizens are also included who do not have to travel at all . &quot;
&quot; such false ordin@@ ances led to a distorted debate on how to deal with out@@ going tax@@ pa@@ yers , &quot; says the analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the Federal Government obviously started sending refugee families back to Italy with under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children when they arrived from there . &quot;
&quot; this is due to an internal paper from the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rü@@ cker Zeitung . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the paper , &quot; &quot; BA@@ MF &quot; &quot; means &quot; &quot; such procedures &quot; &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and infants - to Italy since June 1 , 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , according to the newspaper , referring to the difficult situation on the ground . &quot;
&quot; after the Dublin Agreement , it is responsible for refugees from the EU state they first reach . &quot;
&quot; if a migrant travels to another EU country , this state can send it back to the country . &quot;
&quot; the office now writes : &quot; meanwhile , the reception capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy has considerably increased . &quot;
Italy delivered guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) considers these commitments enough .
other EU states would also return refugees back there as part of the Dublin Agreement .
&quot; the domestic political spokes@@ woman of the left @-@ wing faction in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; &quot; families with children are threatening for lack of acceptance in the Italian asylum system and a danger to child welfare . &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood of people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach already provided the blood donation service for other people .
&quot; at least from the twelve citizens , who were awarded on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who with his meanwhile 100 donations now donated 50 litres of blood . &quot;
&quot; traditionally , the congregation acknowled@@ ges multiple willingness to don@@ ate blood at the Council of the Council of the Council . &quot;
&quot; it is ingeni@@ ous how our body is laid out for it and we appl@@ aud the don@@ ors &quot; respect , which make their blood available to strangers , still un@@ sel@@ fish , &quot; under@@ lined Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; one single blood donation helps several people , &quot; explained the district manager of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the preserved foods are broken down into their components . &quot;
three people could benefit from a blood donation .
&quot; at the same time , Mais@@ enb@@ acher reported about the actions carried out in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach in the spring . &quot;
&quot; this year , we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; said the DR@@ K district manager . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the change to the theatre house has led to higher number of participants a few years ago . &quot;
&quot; before that , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Um@@ rel were counted among the multi @-@ don@@ ors and were awarded for 50 out@@ performed blood donations . &quot;
&quot; half so many book Herbert M@@ air and Dor@@ othe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stefanie St@@ oll and Uwe Vet@@ ter spent ten times each 500 milli@@ liter of their juice . &quot;
the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England will probably later announce that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened speculation over an increase .
the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain slu@@ gg@@ ish when it retained interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensified pressure .
&quot; the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) agreed with 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members striving to increase interest rates this month because weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in its quarterly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on domestic income would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in the fall . &quot;
&quot; but she sign@@ aled that in the next few years interest increases would be necessary to raise the inflation imposed by Bre@@ x@@ it , and she said that bor@@ rowing costs might have to rise more than expected in the financial markets . &quot;
members also voted to withdraw part of the Mam@@ mot@@ h economic stimulus package which was issued one year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
&quot; it will require time for the finance plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks from the next February , although it has been said that it will now be expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; the Bank said : &quot; &quot; in the central pro@@ g@@ nosis of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , as the pressure on the real income of households continues to burden consumption . &quot;
&quot; in the interest rates , it was repeated that &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; would be required to cool inflation and a &quot; slightly larger &quot; scale than the markets expect . &quot;
the markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; however , the Bank emphasized that increases would be &quot; &quot; progres@@ sively &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; limited &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s growth forecasts for this and next year are expected to rise by 1.9 % and 1.7 % in May .
it has retained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell according to these news against the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ appo@@ inting growth figures have damp@@ ened the rising expectations for an increase in interest and the GDP in the second quarter increased from 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .
&quot; growth will likely be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will recover slightly after the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the recent inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households , which are affected by rising inflation and low rise elev@@ ations , as the tigh@@ tening becomes even worse before it becomes better . &quot;
&quot; she added that in the coming years monetary policy cannot &quot; &quot; prevent the income from coming &quot; , &quot; but she added that sal@@ aries will recover significantly at the end of their three @-@ year forecast . &quot;
&quot; the economy is also boo@@ sted by rising demand for British goods , which is due to the weak pounds , which is offset by a proportion of lower consumption expenditure . &quot;
&quot; the decision comes a year after lowering the interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ king of the findings . &quot;
the bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will completely reach the prices and the economy .
&quot; before the Bank &apos;s last judgement on interest rates , the call for interest rates increased because inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three polic@@ y@@ makers calling for an increase to 0.5 % in July . &quot;
&quot; inflation decreased from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said this was expected and will attract it again in the coming months . &quot;
the Bank said that exceeding the ratio to its target of 2 % was &quot; quite &quot; attributable to the weak pound .
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director of Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent down@@ fall of Swa@@ p rates , the mortgage market is likely to be more competitive again , as the len@@ ders are looking lou@@ dly for business and want to end the year in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market is particularly good for those in which the existing deals run out and the new mort@@ g@@ ages complete , and many with toll free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot;
&quot; N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) urged to prescri@@ be 10,000 people to controversial HIV drug &quot;
patients will receive access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment in September following a fight before the High Court .
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that prior to sexual intercourse , pre @-@ positioning pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now provided by health service via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appe@@ al confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court last year , according to which the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it . &quot;
&quot; announced on Thursday , N@@ HS England chief Simon St@@ ev@@ ens was welcomed as an &quot; important new intervention , &quot; while the National AIDS Trust ( NA@@ T ) described this as &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to enable the application of people and other clinics will follow in October 2018 before it will be introduced all over England in April 2018 . &quot;
pre@@ - position pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a series of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces HIV transmission in infectious diseases .
taking pre@@ p prior to intercourse means that just enough medications are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such drugs can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
&quot; those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and individuals with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated . &quot;
&quot; clinics will identify suitable participants who agree to the study including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot;
people who live in England and registered with a family doctor can also register for possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program is signed £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week after an international competitive procurement .
&quot; the study aims to assess the entire potential of pre@@ p by collecting clinical evidence , which is targeted , recorded and implemented on a large scale . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should supplement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in cop@@ ing with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot;
&quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National AIDS Trust ) said : &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ p , aimed at targeting needy and vulnerable people , provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives . &quot;
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , Chief Executive Officer of the Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust said : &quot; &quot; the priority now has to be for the study to be carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind . &quot;
&quot; now that pre@@ p test medicine was procu@@ red , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , Shadow Health Minister , said : &quot; &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and delayed implementation by the government . &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and to end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of pre@@ p .
&quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible across the country to protect people who are HIV @-@ infected , and that it will help us to take a step closer to the end of the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
living the big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks turned this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former merchant with a passion for real estate , reduced 2014 from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to Ear@@ ls Court Apartment . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne hasn &apos;t packed and sold her bags .
&quot; before that , I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; Jo@@ anne says . &quot;
I was looking for something comparable to my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and she had the same high ceilings .
I fell in love with her and made an offer this day . &quot;
&quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
originally a one @-@ bedroom property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Jo@@ anne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine for optimal use of the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my request , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use the 12@@ ,5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms on top of each other , so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating a mezzanine where one could stand . &quot;
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the issue .
&quot; the steel plant is quite complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stack@@ ed on top of each other , without having to bend down . &quot;
&quot; it was not only about building a simple platform , but to attach the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot;
this arrangement allowed Er@@ fan to place two rooms in full height - with much additional drama .
&quot; for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the glam@@ orous living area . &quot;
&quot; mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ lin illumination set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
&quot; at both ends , a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to let it work longer . &quot;
&quot; in the kitchen , the mirror feels like a window into another room . &quot;
at the entrance there are mirr@@ ored units for all the cutlery and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
&quot; through the perception of a glam@@ orous room , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used . &quot;
folding kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering went in , &quot; Er@@ fan explains from the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot;
&quot; it is opposite , so that when you push the door , it gli@@ des very easily . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne was able to gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day , you will sell the land - or how your property is estimated , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on the ground size . &quot;
&quot; here they have managed to enlarge the floor space , and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things that touch you , and therefore help to create an emotional bond within a home , &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you do not fall in love with electrical outlets in the walls .
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square metre of something by default into something quite amazing .
&quot; in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave them . &quot;
brothers struggling for a 500 million US dollar real estate empire
&quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a confrontation with one of the biggest real estate imperi@@ alists of Victori@@ as worth more than 500 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis resi@@ des in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to reti@@ re from family business since 2014 , but a sharp debate about separation takes place in the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the Brothers possess 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , accumulated since the 1973 family bought a shop in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot;
&quot; there , the West@@ co family founded jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores . &quot;
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
&quot; this money was invested in real estate , and De Lu@@ tis portfolio now includes offices in the city center , Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to &apos;s development areas , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt . Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs . &quot;
&quot; following an agreement with her late father , Col@@ in - by Paul described as &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul a third . &quot;
a court file states that this means that Col@@ in &apos;s ownership has a value of $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul in value of $ 17@@ 6 million .
the division of real estate and cash has turned out to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; the divisions proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it . &quot;
&quot; last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place . &quot;
&quot; the brothers now also fight for control of the existing business , including Col@@ in , as Paul claims to exclude him . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but asks Paul to manage some possessions in@@ competent . &quot;
&quot; in an early Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my itali@@ an heritage prescri@@ bes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the cost increases in the case , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and both parties held law firms . &quot;
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her de@@ ceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delic@@ at@@ essen shops from the late 1950 &apos;s and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
&quot; they took advantage of the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property , in which Col@@ in opened the first den@@ im shop of the family . &quot;
Col@@ in says he began West@@ co there when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) .
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to share their property with their sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi said often to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group of companies , whereas Col@@ in claims that when leaving the company , Mark was paid $ 10 million and Luke 26 million . &quot;
&quot; Luke and Mark are , thus says Paul , &quot; per@@ ver@@ ted to the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in kept very back even though he was a former AF@@ L member of the board and after a biography of 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of the TV star .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; only Col@@ in answered by SMS , to say &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say much &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot;
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to acc@@ use me and draw our sur@@ name through the courts , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill his brother &apos;s demands . &quot;
&quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and I would end up in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; he said , and added that he &quot; &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our matter will be solved in the near future by the courts , &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot;
new Chief of Staff Tr@@ ump plans to limit the president &apos;s media ab@@ st@@ in@@ ence .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
&quot; Politi@@ co reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump , including the reports of the news media - hoping to keep the boss on a more even course . &quot;
here is a piece by re@@ porter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with senior executives at his first working day , he posed a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s White House which he wanted to repair : bad information falling into the president &apos;s hands . &quot;
Kelly said the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would get good information .
&quot; Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame Tr@@ ump by monitoring its media diet . &quot;
&quot; President Tr@@ ump &apos;s relationship with television reaches decades back - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV advertising is still strong . &quot;
&quot; when candidate Tr@@ ump was anno@@ yed for unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of jobs that were to be persu@@ aded , &quot; &quot; said the former election campaign officer Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February against Politi@@ co . &quot;
&quot; Politi@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; the key to keeping Tr@@ ump Twitter habit under control , according to six former electoral campaig@@ ners , is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady lob@@ b@@ ying price . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that tr@@ umps Twitter habit ever was &quot; under control &quot; is ridi@@ culous .
perhaps these campaign officials know something we don &apos;t know others - that tr@@ umps T@@ we@@ ets without their interventions would have included even more combus@@ ti@@ bles .
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump has not sent .
&quot; if his staff already managed to keep his anger away from him , their efforts paid off . &quot;
but no one has consistently prevented Tr@@ ump controversy .
&quot; part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Tr@@ ump material that could potentially promote their views of the world . &quot;
&quot; politi@@ co - busy with this story , reported in May about the preference of advis@@ ers to provide du@@ bi@@ ous information to the president for strategic reasons . &quot;
this was an example described by Re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump is able to react like a volcano to negative press cli@@ pp@@ ings , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that he insi@@ sts on finding out wh@@ ence they come from . &quot;
&quot; this was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone mali@@ ciously issued a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of Internet provo@@ cat@@ eur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a he@@ ap of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for sh@@ kan@@ en or that he has not offered concrete evidence , or that he has expressed false alle@@ gations in the past , and has rev@@ oked them . &quot;
Tr@@ ump read the article and started asking people about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; Gold@@ macher added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work and to document the Tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did that work out ?
Kelly is trying three months later to do the same .
&quot; perhaps he will prove himself as more effective manager than pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors still seek influence . &quot;
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys Mission very difficult .
most sought @-@ after criminals get mail from Euro@@ pol
&quot; since the address is unknown , the help of the population will be asked and hoped . &quot;
the police all over Europe sent postcards to dangerous criminals in this summer ( virtual ) postcards .
&quot; since the addresses of the heavy criminals are not known naturally , references from the population will be hoped and requested . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Euro@@ pol reported on Friday &apos;s action following the Winter &quot; Most W@@ an@@ ted &quot; Advent calendar . &quot;
&quot; the experiences would have shown that many fle@@ d@@ les at holiday destinations have been hidden , called it by Euro@@ pol . &quot;
one has compiled 21 postcards for sought @-@ after criminals from 21 EU countries .
&quot; since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the online orders have been arrested so far , at least eleven of them on the basis of evidence after the publication on the website . &quot;
travellers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; Million@@ aire series &apos;
&quot; some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are back with some resol@@ ute travelers on the base of war , who negotiated a tren@@ ch drawn from the congregation in order to rec@@ laim a field in front of their manor houses . &quot;
&quot; travelers have par@@ ked their 20 carav@@ ans in a field outside a well @-@ to @-@ do road from Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; Million@@ aire series . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they were thrown out in May without being deter@@ red by a dit@@ ch excav@@ ated by the Council to prevent their incur@@ sions . &quot;
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defensive facilities and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; fur@@ ious people have urged the Council of Soli@@ hull , saying that it is useless to deal with the problem . &quot;
an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said : &quot; they moved there on Monday night after they were sent on by Bentley He@@ ath where they threw stones onto the pass@@ ers @-@ by .
&quot; the Council must act in action by means of shame , as it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot;
&quot; the travelers were there in May , were moved forward and are now back . &quot;
&quot; more arrived yesterday evening , probably even more today . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by keeping long instructions to protect their parks . &quot;
&quot; I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road , and I am not happy to continue to pay my common charge if the Council cannot stop it . &quot;
&quot; a local people who didn &apos;t want to be called , said : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , we just saw the last round of these travelers , just to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round . &quot;
the numbers have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the park area . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Soli@@ hull Council said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised bearing on the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and cooperate with the police of Soli@@ d@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps so that they move on as quickly as possible .
&quot; in order to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many local residents report an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling on 101 . &quot;
&quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine , when we present our case . &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof to the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof .
&quot; the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts is currently being renovated and is to be re@@ opened on March 1 , next year . &quot;
these are good news for the city .
&quot; due to the closure of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof due to the former ambience of the company company l@@ t@@ d. to 13 April 2014 , approximately 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost and income from the local tax was also lost . &quot;
&quot; in the fall of 2014 , in view of the dramatically increasing numbers of refugees coming to the county , the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation , which provided controversial discussions . &quot;
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a construction plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
&quot; at that time , the decision was not un@@ disputed in the Municipal Council . &quot;
&quot; however , Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts Mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties at the house . &quot;
he was to be right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ot@@ els with director Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a home of the three @-@ star @-@ plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
&quot; you are called Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; at the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof already since a long time Bau@@ sh@@ utt@@ les have been standing in front of the entrance , and when entering the house it becomes clear what extensive renov@@ ations are carried out . &quot;
&quot; the floors were pulled out , ceilings were broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there is still much to do until March .
&quot; it is actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed . &quot;
&quot; everything should later become &quot; &quot; beautiful citizen @-@ close &quot; , &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer is expressing . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery out of it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the equipment . &quot;
&quot; one does not want to position itself at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bath , but already on an up@@ scale downtown level , sh@@ ear@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms would like to set up wide , explains sha@@ vers . &quot;
&quot; individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; talking with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and director of tourism Michael Kr@@ ause , he already led , so sha@@ ver . &quot;
the ideas of the city are identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; according to the amount of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to define himself exactly . &quot;
&quot; just under one million euros , he reck@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the external systems are also brought onto the front man , which is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in the courtyard there is a large terrace , which is accessible from the restaurant , which is public . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia affair : U.S. Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator sets out Grand Jury
&quot; in the Russia affair surrounding U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump , special promot@@ ers Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have appointed a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report . &quot;
&quot; in recent weeks , the committee accepted the work , wrote the Wall Street Journal on appeal to people familiar with the matter . &quot;
the paper regarded the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller had extended and intensified his investigations .
&quot; the CN@@ N channel reported , there are already first invitations issued by the committee in connection with a meeting between the s@@ ling@@ ing of oldest son and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
U.S. intelligence agencies have been acc@@ using the Krem@@ lin for a long time to intervene in the presidential election campaign in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller examined whether there were agreements between the s@@ ling campaign team and Moscow .
&quot; in the focus of the investigation , several men are to stand , who acted as advis@@ ers to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the election campaign . &quot;
&quot; according to reports , Mu@@ eller also magni@@ fied more and more pumps in private and business environments . &quot;
&quot; a few weeks ago , the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote that the special agent Tr@@ ump personally moved to the centre and searched for the accus@@ ation whether the President might have obstruc@@ ted the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot;
Grand Jury &apos;s main task is to examine present evidence in possible crime cases and to decide whether charges are to be charged .
&quot; therefore , Grand Jur@@ ys are also called the defend@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; most of the time , they are turned on when it concerns larger and controversial cases . &quot;
the procedure is always carried out behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be switched on by the public prosec@@ utor to charge individuals under oath .
&quot; according to CN@@ N , invitations have already been issued , which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
people who were involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement called it in the report .
&quot; in addition , they should provide documents . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , also Tr@@ ump consultants and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his brother @-@ in @-@ law Paul Man@@ a@@ fort were talking to the conversation . &quot;
&quot; legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the assumption that Mu@@ eller would not be in@@ timi@@ dated in his work , and that if necessary , he wanted to act quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on to decide on the rise of an indictment . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the sub@@ stitution of the Gre@@ mi@@ um was the beginning of a new phase in investigations and a new cause for concern for President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new revelations , the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to present the Russia affair as a campaign against its political opponents . &quot;
&quot; the Russian history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
the theme gives the Democrats an opportunity to &quot; feel good &quot; because they have nothing else to talk about .
&quot; his special advisor , T@@ y Cob@@ b , stated in a statement that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury . &quot;
&quot; he also usually works in secret , he emphas@@ ised . &quot;
the White House is in favour of any measures that accelerated the work of the special agent in a &quot; fair &quot; way .
the former FBI chief James Com@@ ey said three times that not against the president .
&quot; there is no reason to assume that something has changed , it was said in the Declaration . &quot;
but Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; because of this ou@@ trage , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump had become loud , he had to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ey said in June of a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump asked him to set up the investigation against the former National Security Ad@@ visor , Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n . &quot;
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
&quot; following the presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the Special Agent and its employees . &quot;
this triggered speculation as to whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller released .
&quot; unlike an independent investig@@ ator of the Congress , like in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair , about the later retired President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theore@@ tically be fired on ur@@ ging the President of the Ministry of Justice . &quot;
but several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
&quot; two groups of repub@@ lican and democratic sen@@ ators presented legislation on Thursday , after which the Special Issu@@ er could no longer be dismissed . &quot;
Antar@@ cti@@ ca : gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg drives in Antar@@ cti@@ ca
&quot; in the Western Antar@@ ctic , a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg of the almost seven @-@ fold size of Berlin from Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s solved itself . &quot;
the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday announced this .
&quot; the large col@@ os@@ sus carried over a tri@@ l@@ lion tons and 5@@ 800 square kilometres will now drive north and will probably need two , three years until it has melted . &quot;
&quot; with 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers , it is one of the largest ice gi@@ ants that researchers have registered over the past three decades . &quot;
a danger for people does not go out of him .
the extent to which climate change has played a role in the demo@@ lition of the ic@@ e@@ berg is unclear according to research data .
&quot; in total , however , there have been a series of unusual break@@ through@@ s in the region for about 30 years , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fac@@ simile background . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , this can be related to global warming . &quot;
the now broken col@@ os@@ sus has so far been a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s .
Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by large glaci@@ ers .
it continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ ra lies south of South America almost at the head of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
North of this hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e was disturbed by the balance of wa@@ xing and ab@@ rupt a few years ago .
A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen writes about a complete shelf .
&quot; there is a lot to say about the fact that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ses@@ ho@@ s is in danger , because the front edge has never been pulled back as far as it is currently . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the ice plate stands under tension and can dis@@ integrate if a piece breaks down at a key point . &quot;
melting Sch@@ el@@ ses@@ s and Eis@@ berg do not increase sea level as they float on the water and ice cream as much water as it does after the melting itself .
&quot; however , the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could increase the level of sea level , but only to a small extent , the British research project investig@@ ates Antar@@ cti@@ ca ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot;
&quot; according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is the fourth largest shelf in Antar@@ cti@@ ca with almost 50 000 square kilometres . &quot;
&quot; at the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean approximately 200 meters . &quot;
there it breaks down regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural occurrence and is not aware of any direct connection to climate change , the ice sheet is now in a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; he also affir@@ med . &quot;
&quot; scientists have argued whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ ra will grow again or fall back in the long term and possibly fall together , &quot; said his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
&quot; even if these researchers do not return to climate change , these gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg glaci@@ ers have fallen away in the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula in recent decades . &quot;
this long skirt of the Antar@@ ctic stretches in the direction of South America .
&quot; according to the British Antar@@ ctic Survey research program , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s . &quot;
the increase in temperature has contributed to this decline .
&quot; in the last 50 years , the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has been warming up by about three degrees , counting thus to the areas where the temperature is fastest . &quot;
CD@@ U wants house tari@@ ff at the staff
&quot; because it becomes increasingly difficult to fill vac@@ ant positions , the CD@@ U demands to step out of the employers &apos; association to become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; just before the summer break , the District Day marked 41 new positions in the administration . &quot;
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 trainees have their first working day behind .
the apprentices@@ hips in the circle are obviously very sought @-@ after .
around 6@@ 20 applications were available for the places to be allocated this year .
&quot; nevertheless , the circle continues to lack staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks . &quot;
&quot; at present , there are still 50 vac@@ ancies at the M@@ ett@@ mann district . &quot;
&quot; among other things , doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration are sought . &quot;
&quot; together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG , the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative and counter the shortage of skilled workers in the administration . &quot;
&quot; after the parties &quot; wish , the administration will work out a concept for recruitment and personnel development . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to meet not only short @-@ term requirements for skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented candidate shortage . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should be oriented internally and extern@@ ally , to show concrete measures for cross @-@ star@@ ters and involve a training offensive , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
this sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn &apos;t know before .
other cities adverti@@ se good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions .
the speech is of a regular &quot; competition of public employers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a high number of employees who reti@@ re from service due to illness or age . &quot;
&quot; so it &apos;s high time for action , so that no more jobs will remain un@@ occupied . &quot;
&quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter Völker , leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common application with his party . &quot;
&quot; he took a long time already in the District Day for a f@@ oul @-@ sized surprise , when he publicly questioned the personnel expenses and ba@@ ff@@ led the rest of the parties . &quot;
people want all possibilities to be checked to allow an exit from the communal employers &apos; association .
&quot; if we do not come to a satisfying solution at short notice , the county government should aim with the trade unions - perhaps in co @-@ operation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - a house tari@@ ff , &quot; states peoples . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the CD@@ U tries to pay better the employees and officials than the public service plan envis@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries currently are exactly prescribed , increases or more money are only available if you move to a higher level that is oriented to professional years . &quot;
but the tasks of the circle have grown steadily over the past few years .
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Pro@@ stitution Act . &quot;
&quot; not least due to the increasing number of asylum seekers , Coun@@ cill@@ or Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff . &quot;
Italy tigh@@ tens the tone on NGO migrants &apos; rescue boats
&quot; Italy has warned NGOs that use lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they cannot continue this if they do not adhere to new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; said Minister of Interior , Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came one day after the Italian authorities confis@@ cated a boat from the German relief organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; because their team effectively collabor@@ ated with traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
&quot; the relief organisation , which was in operation only for one year , refused to comment on detailed alle@@ gations of the Italian prosec@@ utor Am@@ bro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ sio . &quot;
&quot; for us , saving human life remains our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; said the organization in a statement on the social media . &quot;
we can only judge all accus@@ ations that are currently collected after we have collected all the information and assess the situation .
&quot; the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October . &quot;
&quot; it is suspected that its crew is aboard din@@ gh@@ y migrants , which are delivered directly by human traffi@@ ckers , and that smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can depart so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one such meeting was said to be only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the Act of the Prosecutor , whose contents were published by Italian media . &quot;
&quot; the occupation is suspected to over@@ ride the authority of the Italian Co@@ ast@@ guard , which monitors rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives . &quot;
&quot; under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats like I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must first have an Italian police inspec@@ tor who monitors their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue missions have agreed to keep the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable , as they would not bring any &quot; significant changes or disabilities &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot;
&quot; among those who refuse to sign , Nobel prize lau@@ re@@ ate organisation Doc@@ tors With@@ out Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , Minn@@ iti said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures had declined in recent weeks , indicating that efforts to strengthen Libyan coast@@ guards and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit . &quot;
&quot; in the last days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month about economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants that leave these countries in the hope of reaching Europe . &quot;
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
&quot; nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bi@@ kers , the &quot; Berlin Out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the Nord@@ pf@@ alz region for four days to enjoy trials and si@@ ght@@ se@@ ein@@ gs . &quot;
three friendly guides were available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led by hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; there were view@@ points , partly on towers , from which one could look far above the Pal@@ at@@ inate forest and the up@@ stream planes . &quot;
&quot; in between there were always longer climbs , for the long tri@@ als rewarded . &quot;
&quot; on the second day , we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to Sal@@ ine and to the folk festival of Wur@@ st@@ markt . &quot;
&quot; again , there was a look@@ out spot on the look@@ out spot , connected by &quot; flo@@ un@@ ge &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot;
on the last two days a lot of al@@ timet@@ ers were announced .
&quot; caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and refu@@ ges brought welcome breaks . &quot;
&quot; in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim , the bi@@ kers chat@@ ted healing br@@ ine in the open @-@ air inhal@@ atorium . &quot;
also Neu@@ stadt was also controlled .
&quot; after 17@@ 3 kilometres and almost 4@@ 500 meters of altitude , the group met the Pal@@ at@@ inate Forest from its best side - sporty and cul@@ turally - met . &quot;
console instead of law@@ ns - Bundes@@ liga is equi@@ pping itself for e @-@ sport
&quot; in future , sports stars are sitting in front of computer consoles , instead of being swe@@ at@@ y in wind and weather over the stadium ras@@ cals ? &quot;
&quot; fact is : e @-@ sport has long been a serious business , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gau@@ ges included . &quot;
&quot; this also recognised the first federal government associations , who are increasingly involved in this field . &quot;
&quot; the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , followed by FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sports department in mid @-@ July and took two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game . &quot;
&quot; we hope to inspire completely new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
it is certain that a number of clubs still climb this turn .
&quot; next weekend , FIFA World Cup Football Association organized the first Inter@@ active Club World Cup in London , where the gam@@ ers of various clubs compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven have qualified . &quot;
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in e @-@ sports .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer L@@ ever@@ kus@@ en and Wer@@ der Bremen has meanwhile advised an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds , that young people will go to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and : the clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets , especially the Asian ones . &quot;
&quot; with prominent E @-@ athletes under contract , you could be far more likely to be present on these markets online than once a year , to send the Bundes@@ liga to Asia . &quot;
what is it all about ?
&quot; computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or the football simulation of FIFA will be challenged at the competition level . &quot;
&quot; as in normal sports , le@@ agues have long since established themselves , in which professionals compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; and in the 2022 World Cup , e @-@ sport is already part of the official program . &quot;
but is it really a sport ?
&quot; for many , the idea is certainly getting used . &quot;
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ming also dealt with the question for a long time .
&quot; for Professor at the Deutsche Spor@@ th@@ ochschule in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical reactions that can be found in classic sports - for example , increased heart rate , stress reactions , hormonal changes . &quot;
&quot; in addition , cognitive skills , a technical and tactical understanding and a quick reaction capability are required . &quot;
professional gam@@ ers should exercise not only on the console but also their body and respect nutrition .
&quot; the custom player is a good player . &quot;
but F@@ rob@@ bing also sees problems : &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a topic . &quot;
&quot; controls are difficult to perform at online games , and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing . &quot;
the scientist emphas@@ ises the high integr@@ ative effect of E @-@ Sports .
&quot; players are on the move internationally , this is like a big global family , there are no inter@@ cultural barriers . &quot;
a study by the management consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association Inter@@ active entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth in e @-@ sports .
&quot; in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly on advertising , sponsor@@ ship and big tournaments . &quot;
&quot; in three years , sales are expected to be 130 million . &quot;
&quot; with some 2.4 billion euros of the Bundes@@ liga , this is little . &quot;
&quot; however , the e @-@ sport is not far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hockey , &quot; the Del@@ o@@ itte advis@@ ers write . &quot;
&quot; internationally , many countries are already continuing . &quot;
&quot; great markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the US team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports . &quot;
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport bet@@ ting provider Uni@@ kr@@ n .
there is a lot to do in Europe as well .
&quot; in a Norwegian school , E @-@ Sport has been introduced as a teaching subject , says F@@ rob@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; according to D@@ utt , the football @-@ premi@@ er clubs in the Netherlands and France are now obliged to set up an e @-@ sports department . &quot;
&quot; in the European comparison Germany is la@@ gging behind , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B Executive Board R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; to exp@@ ire only in nostal@@ gia , and to clear the old times is no longer enough today . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but to align the company with the modern market at the same time . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digi@@ ti@@ zed world , &quot; says D@@ utt . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t stick to the fact that only in football , everything remains as it was always . &quot;

&quot; Michelle Car@@ ter sentenced to suicide because of the lyrics , Con@@ rad Roy &quot;
a Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boy@@ friend through texts and calls for suicide .
&quot; Michelle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her sentence behind bars and five years have been exposed to prob@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ ter was sentenced in June due to negligence by Con@@ rad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 . &quot;
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is in@@ consol@@ able .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain free until his appeal .
&quot; she was confronted with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a psychological illness . &quot;
&quot; dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood with tears in her eyes , with folded hands and downward @-@ looking eyes when she was convic@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; her actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot;
she finished his life in order to make her own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she has not shown any regre@@ ts . &quot;
but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that she completely regre@@ ts .
&quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , however , he did not find out that their age or maturity or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a public prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is &quot; no day in which I do not feel the loss of my beloved son . &quot;
&quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything . I try , in spite of all my pain that we will carry for eternity with us , to be there for his sisters , &quot; it says . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she would never take part in the wedding of her brother or be a a@@ unt for his children . &quot;
&quot; no longer this single person with whom I was together since my birth every day is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent because there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to claim another , commit suicide . &quot;
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case drew national attention after Car@@ ter revealed text messages that she had encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; hang yourself up , jump from a building , get yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; &quot; she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family . &quot;
&quot; in the moments before his suicide , she wrote : &quot; &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Every@@ thing you need to do is turn on the generator and you &apos;ll be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz told Car@@ ter &apos;s attention was directed by the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from the case by any press .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
Am@@ anda Kno@@ x was one of the few who defended Car@@ ter in 2007 because of murder of her British room@@ mate in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago .
&quot; Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Car@@ ter deserves compassion and help , not jail . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ mich : learn from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua Sh@@ ook was allowed to run as a captain at the Audi Cup is no coincidence .
the FC Bayern tr@@ umps a great season to the Con@@ fed Cup winner - extra motivation doesn &apos;t hurt .
&quot; something was different on its place in the cabin , that looked Joshua Kim@@ ber@@ myself immediately , even though the additional piece of clothing was very , very small . &quot;
&quot; but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup , of course , no Philipp Lah@@ m and no Manuel Neu@@ er was to be seen , he made the binding commitment to his arm . &quot;
&quot; the trainer didn &apos;t announce it , &quot; said the Con@@ fed Cup winner afterwards , after his first deployment as a Bayern @-@ Captain . &quot;
&quot; well , the entry could have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples . &quot;
but I could interpret the sign of the coach as well .
&quot; not the eight year old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal had been chosen as a game leader in the C @-@ El@@ f , who came from youth players , de@@ but@@ ants and just out of the holiday , but he . &quot;
sugar is preferably distributed to those who want to keep a lot of things that you want to keep in a good mood .
those who have been chosen to compete with Lah@@ m can only use a little extra motivation .
&quot; Kim@@ olos confirmed , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old fl@@ atten@@ ed over the field as a mini @-@ Lah@@ m . &quot;
&quot; to the right rear , that is his position , the white band@@ age on the arm did the rest . &quot;
&quot; and at all , Kim@@ mich took part in this initial formation as the one who can take the helm at the best . &quot;
he gave instructions and tried to steer the un@@ coordinated trou@@ pe .
he had a look at the whole while many others were dealing with themselves .
&quot; Vi@@ dal to over@@ play his missing fitness ( folded barely ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches thus , on the devil , to get out of the achievements of the Asia @-@ journey ( folded also only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le were not neg@@ atively affected in their first appearance in the Bayern @-@ Tri@@ cot . &quot;
this worked out very well .
&quot; in addition to Kim@@ mich , Ru@@ dy in front of the defense , Sü@@ le acted confi@@ dently . &quot;
&quot; the nam@@ ach@@ ingly occupied Nap@@ oli storm was often difficult , and Sü@@ le also tried a few times in the game @-@ building . &quot;
his colleague Ru@@ dy admitted that the result &quot; wasn &apos;t as we hoped for .
but he also showed a decent performance at the debut .
&quot; game reloc@@ ation , tempo change : &quot; for this style , I was also brought up . &quot;
&quot; as usual , this Bavarian world is still for the new entran@@ ces , one saw in connection with the game . &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ dy , for example , did not give one or two in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but determined six or seven interviews . &quot;
&quot; after a few cr@@ un@@ chy statements in the back of his new fellow players , Kim@@ olos said goodbye . &quot;
&quot; there he heard an interesting sentence from Sü@@ le : &quot; &quot; what is going on here , I have already noticed . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , you just have to win every game . &quot;
&quot; after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new . &quot;

company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : business pra@@ ises bis@@ cuits pace
&quot; it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ ably , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate . &quot;
&quot; this shows after more than a year , in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office . &quot;
chambers and companies from the region talk to T V @-@ demand from a change in economic policy - and at the same time add the old minister .
&quot; Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Trier companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; Wis@@ sing picks up the wishes of the economy , which has blocked Lem@@ ke all . &quot;
the biggest turn @-@ turn of course looks natural in infrastructure policy : the gap closure of the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top in the country &apos;s priority list .
&quot; this year , the Ministry hopes for a planning procedure until 2021 is intended to be the construction law . &quot;
&quot; the West Bank of Trier is also playing a role in the plans of the country , which is in the urgent need of the Federal Office of Transport . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to put the route into operation in December 2020 , says ministry spokesperson Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; of course , nat@@ us sees it as a guide to support regional , but internationally competitive companies . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) , as suggested by Wis@@ sing , uses a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Label in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports losing for ten years . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , praise the Chamber of Commerce . &quot;
&quot; in the new master bonus , the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier sees an additional incentive for young apprenti@@ ces , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; a premium of 1000 Euro is provided for the passed master test and 2,500 euros , if graduates have to become independent within ten years after the master &apos;s training . &quot;
but the home@@ work schedule for the country remains long .
&quot; the planned road construction is quickly facts to create , at the same time there is no need for the country at the necessary personnel , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Chief Executive Officer of the Chamber of Industry of Trier . &quot;
&quot; to date , only 29 positions have been occupied by 56 new engineers , who want to set up Wis@@ sing at Landes@@ betrieb Mobile . &quot;
the Chamber of Commerce requires more jobs to be awarded to external offices .
&quot; Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf , CD@@ U Group vice @-@ president , refers to the calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country has invested more than 20 million euros less in the preservation of country roads in 2017 and 2018 . &quot;
&quot; Frank nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country , as it wants to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the previous broad@@ band expansion in the country is sober@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , regional companies had rated the grid supply in an I@@ HK survey only with a score of 3,@@ 4 . &quot;
they compla@@ ined about stagn@@ ant Internet connections and break@@ outs .
former Minister of Economy E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and still sits in the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind .
&quot; the Green Group left Lem@@ ke on April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe , where she cleared the field after four months because of in@@ consisten@@ cies . &quot;
Audi to change 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter reaction
&quot; one day before Audi &apos;s announcement , BMW announced that it would offer to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW chair@@ person said that &quot; &quot; there are smar@@ ter options as driving restrictions , &quot; &quot; and thus moved to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - to ban or limit diesel vehicles . &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described enterprises as re@@ vocation .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to comply with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; nitrogen oxi@@ des , em@@ itting diesel engines , are considered to be carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma . &quot;
&quot; the cost of autom@@ akers to install systems to neutr@@ alize the exhaust gases em@@ itted by diesel vehicles also increase , which makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of ignor@@ ing the mighty car companies and ignor@@ ing the signs of the problem .
&quot; companies try to avoid the mistakes made by Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called shut@@ down devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but returning to normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several Volkswagen employees were charged , others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
last month the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
&quot; the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is an Italian and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be tried in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was taken into German criminal investigations with Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to b@@ ypass the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request focused on the United States has been expanded . &quot;
the inclusion of Audi into the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes dispro@@ portion@@ ately to the benefit of Volkswagen .
this message has the raft on Saturday at the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
&quot; as a result , the Is@@ ar visitors will also take part in a raft through Munich tomorrow , which has a special message . &quot;
&quot; if you want to go back to Is@@ ar on Saturday , you will see a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke . &quot;
&quot; and this is not a common raft , with Is@@ ar @-@ tourists . &quot;
but the construction department wants to clarify .
on the raft you can see a big inf@@ ran@@ spar@@ ent .
it shows a garbage mountain .
the pr@@ elu@@ de to a publicity campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; with the motto &quot; True Love , &quot; the understanding of the Is@@ ar should be sharpen@@ ed as a protective game of wildlife . &quot;
&quot; last summer , the raft was over the Is@@ ar and also this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behavior . &quot;
Mor@@ dil@@ los B@@ ases and the laughter against the suffering
&quot; Mor@@ di@@ llo was temporarily one of the most publi@@ ci@@ zed carto@@ ons , the no@@ oses of his characters are his trademark . &quot;
&quot; even with 85 , the Argent@@ inian still records and works on a film . &quot;
&quot; his message : laughing , &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
&quot; Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on August 4 , 1932 as son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires . &quot;
&quot; in the first few years as an artist , he introduced himself among other things as a drau@@ gh@@ ts@@ man for congrat@@ ulation cards - which frustr@@ ated him . &quot;
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said once . &quot;
&quot; after gradu@@ ating in Lima , New York and Paris , the breakthrough came to him at the end of the Six@@ ties : with the release of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
&quot; again and again , the artists of cities were inspired . &quot;
&quot; large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo figures tum@@ ble in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning , according to his own specifications , he still sits at the drawing table , works every day for almost ten hours . &quot;
&quot; over cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and clo@@ cks , its dro@@ ll figures continue to spread widely worldwide . &quot;
for six years he has also been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters .
the main person in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los most popular animal in his drawings - that has a thousand @-@ foot@@ er as an opponent .
&quot; for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie that is to come to the cinema wall in 2019 . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot;
the script is not written by him .
&quot; therefore he rather relies on the TV series , which , like its original drawings , is produced without wor@@ dless . &quot;
la@@ ven@@ der from Provence threatened by climate change
&quot; he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; la@@ ven@@ der is declining due to the conditions remin@@ ding of drought conditions and because of the disease @-@ borne insects , leading scientists and farmers trying to find solutions , major headache . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , expert in Provence research institute CRI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years , which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn . &quot;
this has effects on the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
&quot; there is also a small ci@@ ch@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its d@@ warf ci@@ ca@@ das , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is a lot in the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil is not only attracting holiday@@ makers but it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics .
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; &quot; instead of having very long vegetable ears with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened . &quot;
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that are considered are better water distribution and the slow@@ ing of evap@@ oration from the soil , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mix of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought . &quot;
the town of Gei@@ sa in Thurin@@ gia is celebrating its 1200 anniversary this year .

the assass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
&quot; the staff of the Week@@ ly Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet Wedn@@ es@@ days to check their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a through organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars . &quot;
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to speak about security . &quot;
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels safer : they should take their children into the office , which in 2009 were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades , or leave them at home . &quot;
&quot; security experts have written three words on a plaque on the front of the room : opponents , neutr@@ als , allies . &quot;
&quot; they ask the re@@ porters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , percep@@ tions and gut feelings suff@@ ice . &quot;
&quot; there are drug smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists suspected of standing on the government &apos;s salary list or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no rest from the violence , and while the cor@@ p@@ ses are accum@@ ulating throughout the country , more and more journalists are there : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to has been under federal protection and until now there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries this year . &quot;
&quot; among the latter is her publisher and her inspir@@ er of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder Ja@@ vier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot;
&quot; two re@@ porters in the 1930s , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez wear t @-@ shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death and the re@@ porters discuss their shared themes , the trauma , their night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although a Son@@ der Federal At@@ tor@@ ney General was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists , it only initiated two criminal proceedings , according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; as with most thousands of mur@@ ders , each year associated with drug traffi@@ cking and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely put on trial . &quot;
&quot; at Ri@@ odo@@ ce they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are in@@ consol@@ able and although the terrain is even more tre@@ ach@@ erous . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting for the discussion of security has little value , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we don &apos;t know why , we mi@@ str@@ ust everyone . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - who is translated with &quot; &quot; T@@ wel@@ ve river &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Sag@@ itt@@ arius drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown @-@ up children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly around in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an freely .
&quot; but on the subject of Val@@ dez , there is practically nothing but silence . &quot;
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest in the past year and the extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , since rival fac@@ tions struggle here to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated , two @-@ story Maus@@ ole@@ ums for drug kings that are bigger than many homes for the living . &quot;
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable har@@ bours and drug trade routes in the United States .
&quot; despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , broke with the blame that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
&quot; first , there was the publication of an interview with Damas@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival cart@@ el frac@@ tions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons . &quot;
&quot; this release may have anno@@ yed the sons , the presum@@ ed gang members purchased each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks . &quot;
the second error was not forcing Val@@ dez to leave the country for his own security after the confis@@ cation of another newspaper that had published the same story .
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined forces with five colleagues for the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars .
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the drug problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; over time , the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased . &quot;
&quot; re@@ porters loved to publish hard @-@ fitting investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to treat . &quot;
&quot; eight years after the foundation of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; for her coverage in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his courage in the pursuit of Mexican drug history , wherever it led them . &quot;
he gave up voluntarily that he was afraid .
&quot; I would like to continue living , &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot;
&quot; drug traffi@@ cking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV . &quot;
&quot; you must take over the task that you as a journalist , either that or you play the dum@@ b . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; what have you done in the face of so many dead ... why didn &apos;t you tell what was going on ?
&quot; the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team mis@@ ses Val@@ dez , the fun bird , who could curse as a do@@ ck@@ worker , the friend who was gener@@ ously embra@@ ced by hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
they trusted in his routine .
he would always bear his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Gu@@ ay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit there at the same table . &quot;
&quot; now they ask , was his love for routine his destruction ? &quot;
his death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how to do their work best and stay alive .
&quot; they don &apos;t like to deal with their wives , their children , their clean businesses , their secret home and run@@ ways to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation . &quot;
trust his own instinc@@ ts .
&quot; if it smells wrong , stay away from it . &quot;
&quot; the anger is , the publisher of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; &quot; smell a sense that can be fool@@ ed ... and then the thing happened to Ja@@ vier . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home . &quot;
the landscape changes constantly .
&quot; days before it became known that Spy@@ ware , which was sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
&quot; outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for shelter from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree . &quot;
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a mid @-@ class neighborhood of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the joke , some of the re@@ porters asked themselves whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who called the governor themselves as un@@ trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; it is months since the re@@ porters have gone to the mountain landscape , where drug gangs are de facto under control . &quot;
&quot; for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has fu@@ cked on three main stories . &quot;
&quot; there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former known , Ju@@ lio C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a . &quot;
they also had an expos@@ é to the state expendi@@ tures focused on the governor &apos;s hom@@ etown .
&quot; there was a group located in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the Office of the Prosecutor , a kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or as it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities . &quot;
a re@@ porter learned from the public record that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who ruled the governing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) which dominated all political levels almost the whole century .
&quot; recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were indic@@ ted for high @-@ cali@@ bre cases of corruption . &quot;
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack . &quot;
&quot; just a few months earlier , the readers would have considered the column of Val@@ dez as the best informed source of kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; earlier we had known what happened , &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with nick@@ name &quot; &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; &quot; because of his slim body stat@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; now , all channels of communication are broken with our sources . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez &apos;s office became a storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers prot@@ esting against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the employees have become something they never expected : activists in the name of the press . &quot;
re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez snor@@ ted a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration for another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor .
&quot; Salvador Ad@@ amed disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
a burned body was discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is his .
&quot; throughout the country , journalists have become lou@@ der by writing in organized protests &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on pav@@ ements and buildings . &quot;
&quot; on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is gone away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities of spy on journalists and letting them kill them because they told the truth . &quot;
&quot; since then she has asked her to be re @-@ divided by the government , because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated her obj@@ ectivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime , government officials and a valid society . &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that re@@ porters are not only killed by drug gangs , but also by the order of politicians and security forces that put together organised crime under a ceiling . &quot;
&quot; last year , the media group &quot; Arti@@ cul@@ o 19 &quot; assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists of the police and officials . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico you die , because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect . &quot;
no one for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; her body was found together with a note , which was said to be signed by the Z@@ et@@ as @-@ Kart@@ ell : &quot; &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and head@@ phone were located next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua following the assass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to do as El Man@@ ana by Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assass@@ ination of their director in 2004 .
&quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the title page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot; &quot;
some journalists have fled their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is difficult to find work in exile , and still watch the streets and search for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as evi@@ dently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who remain behind and continue their work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , ad@@ mits that drug traffi@@ cking is scar@@ ing him . &quot;
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and that &apos;s why I became a re@@ porter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ va sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and drank beer , when all their phones were bu@@ zz@@ ing . &quot;
a series of sho@@ ot@@ ings with riv@@ als and security forces near the Maz@@ at@@ lan resort had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued to escal@@ ate as promised by a number of cart@@ el messages in the region .
from the edge of the board they have published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce via mobile phone .
the title page had to be changed the next day .
Sir@@ ens he@@ ul@@ ten near - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the polic@@ emen who kept watch to see if they were willing .
&quot; if they were afraid , they did not show it . &quot;
&quot; under the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for the whole Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his footsteps . &quot;
&quot; how can you just think about it , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; when the same day Ja@@ vier was murdered , the intern asked me to send them to the street . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ r used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to escape his enemies
&quot; at first sight , it looks like a statue , albeit a frigh@@ tening one . &quot;
researchers have now found out that the first findings of the unbelievable N@@ ash@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian min@@ er have been preserved so well that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa der Dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so well received that they could even find that its sc@@ aly skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said they had something of an &quot; rest@@ less past . &quot;
&quot; the report in the magazine &quot; Current Bi@@ ology &quot; described it as &quot; the best @-@ preserved , ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r that has ever been found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ r specimens in the world . &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier who lived between 110 million and 112 million years in the middle of the cycle time .
&quot; his unbeliev@@ ably well @-@ preserved condition has start@@ led researchers who describe it as &quot; &quot; really remarkable &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant e@@ ater is the best preserved fossil of its kind . &quot;
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk as he founded the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the North of Alber@@ ta , Canada on March 21 , 2011 . &quot;
&quot; he met something that seemed to be missing from the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely . &quot;
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ rr@@ ell Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pound ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy earth @-@ cla@@ ws . &quot;
&quot; after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you only smile a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it slept , &quot; &quot; said the chief author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ rr@@ ell Museum , where the creature was to be seen . &quot;
&quot; it will enter into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ r specimens , the Mon@@ a Lisa der Dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; researchers have discovered that this plant e@@ ater , although covered with a arm@@ or and resembles a changing tank , is probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the strongly ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from predat@@ ors , and used an shiel@@ ding technique , which is known as counter @-@ relief , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this would have allowed him to better mix himself in his surroundings and avoid his enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million @-@ year @-@ old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier made head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now visible at the Royal Ty@@ rr@@ ell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta Mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli , according to the museum technician Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours with it carefully . &quot;
the astonishing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and arm@@ our over his body .
&quot; they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ ading , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the tip of the creature was darker than its under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the counter sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising since the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta by far exceeds the animals living today . &quot;
&quot; it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ r hun@@ ts enough pressure by eating flesh @-@ eating din@@ osau@@ rs , that evolution encouraged the disgu@@ ise of confrontation as a means of survival . &quot;
&quot; but most of the contemporary animals that use counter sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or belt @-@ animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loo@@ t , which sign@@ alizes that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong predat@@ or behavior on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ r predat@@ ors must have been the chal@@ k @-@ time , &quot; Brown said . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
&quot; scientists continue to investigate the animal on his life , including his ser@@ rated bow@@ el to find out what it has eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r when he died , got into a river and drove out into the sea , where he sank on his back to the se@@ abed . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as south @-@ fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably much farther inland spreads than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved sc@@ aly skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal , &quot; Brown said . &quot;
the result is that the animal today looks almost the same as in the early cycle time .
&quot; you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you only squ@@ ash a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that he is sleeping . &quot;
&quot; the cycle time was a time when huge ther@@ opo@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs standing on two legs crossed the earth . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , the Tyran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived millions of years to Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters . &quot;
&quot; the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Bi@@ ology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in mud . &quot;
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk as he founded the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the North of Alber@@ ta , Canada on March 21 , 2011 . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the saf@@ est ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r in the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip . &quot;
&quot; on average , the creatures were about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long spi@@ kes that ra@@ ged from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant e@@ ater was washed by western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea .
but the underwater equipment of the din@@ osau@@ r preserved its arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the house rules cover still b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko has written for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is as rare as a lot@@ to gain . &quot;
&quot; the more I approach , the more conf@@ using it will . &quot;
pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates that carry the skull of the animal .
&quot; his right front foot is on his side , his five fingers are spread upward . &quot;
I can count the scales on his sole .
in the thunder@@ storm : Mass@@ enk@@ ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many injured
violent accident on Thursday evening at the A@@ 8 : nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass murder campaign .
&quot; there are numerous wounded , miles long stands - and G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) , about 20 people were injured in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; according to the first data of the police , around 17@@ .00 o &apos;clock between Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm , almost 30 vehicles , including trucks , probably crashed . &quot;
&quot; at first , no information was given about the exact number of the injured . &quot;
&quot; it is an easy to moderate injury , a police spokesman said . &quot;
a large range of rescue vehicles was carried out at the accident site .
the A@@ 8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich .
&quot; in the direction of travel Munich , a back@@ stage of about ten kilometres was formed . &quot;
&quot; as reported by an A@@ Z re@@ porter , it also occurred on the counter @-@ road to massive im@@ pedi@@ ments - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
the fire bri@@ gade took note of the license plates of the car drivers who now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pen@@ alties .
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 o &apos;clock a second accident occurred at the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group testing &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced : nothing remin@@ ding is sitting in the train and sleeping .
or you are immersed in his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : buff@@ f .
the conductor comes and w@@ akes an uns@@ us@@ p@@ ected or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
card control .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are over .
the Deutsche Bahn ( Deutsche Bahn ) is currently testing the free ticket control .
&quot; you simply confirm by phone , that you can take your seat and de@@ valu@@ ate the ticket . &quot;
&quot; at present , a test operation is running on two tracks . &quot;
&quot; if the offer arrives , we will expand it . &quot;
&quot; it will likely be available at many other long @-@ distance routes in Germany in the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; said a railway spokesman . &quot;
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; calls the train ticket de@@ valuation without a conductor .
&quot; to be able to use them , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to book an online ticket - which is already the most passengers .
&quot; it is also necessary to have a look at the app of the train , the DB Navig@@ ator , which is the most convenient way to book the ticket . &quot;
and last but not least you need a seat reservation .
&quot; because the &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; works : one climbs into the train , calling his ticket under &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with the test customers , a button for electronic de@@ valuation appears . &quot;
the train companions get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y .
&quot; if the train companion arrives at the ticket inspection station Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already paid online ticket . &quot;
&quot; so you can continue to sleep , work on , keep quiet . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which is to take advantage of the passengers . &quot;
&quot; if you want to travel relaxed without ticket inspection by our train cabin crew , you can check out the DB Navig@@ ator yourself . &quot;
&quot; this allows passengers to make their travel time in the train more personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB Fern@@ verkehr &apos;s Marketing Management Board . &quot;
&quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to the individual customer needs . &quot;
&quot; those who often travel by train know that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket controls are among the biggest off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; often you have , in any case , but one of the fellow travelers do not have all the documents you need for the de@@ valuation of online tickets . &quot;
either the credit card or the identity card or otherwise a document that you have to show .
&quot; the result is endless discussions between train companions and passengers , which leads to bad mood in the compartment or large room and delays in the control of one &apos;s own tickets and takes the conductor at the end of time to take care of other concerns . &quot;
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and this also applies only to ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
other numbers on the same route are not un@@ locked .
&quot; how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question , &quot; &quot; Stret@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Ferr@@ ell was shaken up to its core . &quot;
&quot; just one day after she arrived in New York City , the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolled by Facebook on her phone . &quot;
she stum@@ bled upon a post by someone from the High School .
&quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it is still on the road , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; confused , as nobody else posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was continuously supp@@ ressed on her tim@@ eline .
&quot; the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old who was killed by a white police officer in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . &quot;
he posted a picture of Brown &apos;s lifel@@ ess body stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; &quot; said Ferr@@ ell . &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she removed her cell phone to return to T@@ we@@ ets on the Can@@ field Drive in the evening .
&quot; there were photos of the police band and people shou@@ ting , and of a man who claimed to be Brown &apos;s father , who bore a sign with the inscription : &quot; &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &apos;s police just killed my un@@ armed boy ! &quot;
she watched a live feed in which a polic@@ eman stood in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman vo@@ iced his ri@@ fle and cried , &quot; &quot; I will kill you all . &quot;
&quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; recalls Ferr@@ ell to her statement . &quot;
this is not the kind of murder we have used to and which we can call typical .
at that moment I felt shi@@ vers .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
&quot; after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she removed her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning . &quot;
&quot; what happened over the next three years with Ferr@@ ell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the subject of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from the 11 . &quot;
&quot; it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and power of resistance , who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; when Ferr@@ ell with her daughter , who wore a cau@@ lif@@ lower and a matching crown , drove to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two discussed a conversation that they had countless times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black condition . &quot; &quot;
&quot; you remember , as I taught you , when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot;
&quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot;
&quot; I could not take her with me , &quot; &quot; said Ferr@@ ell later . &quot;
what has happened today is a high point of what happened in the past .
it must know it and see it and be drawn up in it .
&quot; it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organisation , but also know the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience a bl@@ at@@ ant racism , she is no different from the next black women child . &quot;
I feel I would be doing a bad service to keep them away from it .
&quot; the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ charge of officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
&quot; there , Ferr@@ ell and her daughter have joined with a local business owner who made lunch . &quot;
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; slowly , a new type of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Ferr@@ ell . &quot;
&quot; my activ@@ ism changed completely after 9 August , &quot; she said , notic@@ ing that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ se Association and focused on food @-@ justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organising .
it is all coming . &quot;
&quot; weeks later Ferr@@ ell met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film during an evening demonstration . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her c@@ amer@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question came from Ferr@@ ell : &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can exploit ? &quot;
&quot; this scep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of wh@@ ites - in a community who benefited from their pain and resistance . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently said in an interview , &quot; &quot; We heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an already collabor@@ ated with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist known for his activ@@ ism around death penalty in@@ mates . &quot;
&quot; his commitment brought Ferr@@ ell closer to the project , along with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns firing . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we talk , &quot; Davis said . &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me , how these people will be presented , for that &apos;s how I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to focus on Ferr@@ ell &apos;s experience - to show that the &quot; movement &quot; is not a mes@@ si@@ ah leader , but a community that is coming together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the most open participant in the film . &quot;
&quot; consequently , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; show surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ ell &apos;s life , as she falls in love with her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; said Ferr@@ ell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I understand that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the human@@ isation of black people .
&quot; in addition , Ferr@@ ell &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , who , following the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 , marked the film &quot; Black@@ live Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall , &quot; said Ferr@@ ell , &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay men must bear the main burden of everything . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not an affir@@ mati@@ cally type of action , &quot; in which Ferr@@ ell was selected as the heart of the film because of her identity . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who stir@@ red up this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is no accident , although it was at the forefront , because in a life at these cross@@ ings as a black , gay woman is so much at stake . &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long disappeared , but the racial connections between the church and the police continue to exist . &quot;
Ferr@@ ell is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years because of the blocking of a highway at a demonstration .
it describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area that she calls her home : &quot; chaos . &quot;
&quot; however , she cl@@ ings to a song and she feels committed to this memory , since she went on the street three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on . &quot;
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we need to love and support one another .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;

the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; while the one to the bit gallery say : &quot; &quot; that would be a dream &quot; &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That &apos;s really great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; no man needs &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or quite simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot;
&quot; while the pro@@ pon@@ ents build that a gallery attracts more customers to the city , as well as the rest of the shops , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farmers market hall stands , in which 13 direct markets offer their products . &quot;
&quot; with the start of the construction work , it will be concluded . &quot;
the Galerie @-@ makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - for Bed@@ a @-@ Platz with possibility to sit outside .
&quot; Sim@@ one Room : &quot; for many years , we have been selling almost weekly in the farmer &apos;s market hall . &quot;
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the country women always gladly again . &quot;
we also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us .
we would wish that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
&quot; in other cities , there is also this . &quot;
especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing can settle in a market hall in the gallery will amount to the amount of rent .
but this should not be very low in the new project . &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what are the shopping palaces in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I think it is superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
there is enough of them in our city .
you can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .
&quot; but since there is not even a decent weekly market here , it is all the more important that at least the market hall will be preserved . &quot;
&quot; after all , the product offered there is fresh , is mostly offered directly from the producer and is also inexpensive . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , shops in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies , because the r@@ ents there are often not portable for a retailer . &quot;
&quot; a pity , specialty shops are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably disappear . &quot;
wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping centre with a market hall doesn &apos;t suit me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
&quot; first of all , where is the peasant market hall going to go down during the construction period ? &quot;
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery is actually coming .
or does the ghost @-@ bit gallery manage to sell all the stores from Bit@@ burg before ?
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it simply won &apos;t work .
&quot; and a shopping center that is empty , no one needs . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market instead of this gallery . &quot;
&quot; but for a peasant market hall , thanks to the ins@@ an@@ ely many - as I find - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg no longer place . &quot;
&quot; once the farmers market hall is destroyed , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a suitable simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing &apos;s DNA
&quot; in the middle of the space of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are visible - white , black and brown , which are almost in@@ conspic@@ uous , hanging on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from che@@ eks @-@ tu@@ gs and hair@@ cuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
&quot; Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former secret service analy@@ tic@@ ist served a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after being publicly classified as a secret diplom@@ ati@@ st about the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website . &quot;
the new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( a suitable simil@@ arity ) .
&quot; she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline united her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a Trans@@ wife and a ground@@ breaking dissi@@ dent , whose conviction has been transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has created an algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA , which has been extracted from Mann@@ ing and created from the 30 portraits , a sharp , albeit somewhat intellectual comment not only to the forms of DNA data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also for identity . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has already talked openly about the identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , has been convic@@ ted for 20 charges , including six violations of the es@@ pion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; her image was supp@@ ressed by the prison , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ and @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing clearly sits on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ inum blonde wig - with which she was associated . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was just from the great success of its 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; . &quot;
&quot; in this , the artist produced portraits of for@@ en@@ sic art@@ ef@@ acts like cigarette but@@ t and chew@@ ing gum by extrac@@ ting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look . &quot;
this was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in jail , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press preview of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed , so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
&quot; the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated m@@ use were too un@@ equal , who changed several letters over the course of two years . &quot;
&quot; they even created one of Sho@@ il@@ i Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated com@@ ics &quot; &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images &quot; , &quot; which fores@@ aw a future in which the President Chel@@ ating would convert judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; that Obama actually had only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as was a welcome way of happy coincidence . &quot;
&quot; there is also now at the opening of the exhibition something deep and strong , as Donald Tr@@ ump is leading a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to keep the rigid divisions that he should actually fix . &quot;
&quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked after the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen for a particular reason . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery Mann@@ ing called with her over@@ sized signature underneath ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name is equipped with a heart ) an end of &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , of which sex , race , sexu@@ ality and culture have been . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall , its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ th of Cs and Gs and As , is written in pencil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des after the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist ) , as aston@@ ish@@ ingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all . &quot;
&quot; what people will hopefully take away is that our gen@@ ome is not about who we are and how openly genetic data is for interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also to be seen . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is a page from the above mentioned comic novel . &quot;
she shows Mann@@ ing how she appears with a hands @-@ on hands in the hands of the United States discipline barracks as King Kong .
&quot; if they cool your speech , then they won . &quot; &quot;
&quot; so , never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; said the artist , who greeted me from Philadelphia . &quot;
I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ umps when I talk about it .
Mann@@ ing hasn &apos;t seen the exhibition personally - just as it should be anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it then she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks from her own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ ons that are like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
&quot; this was also target @-@ oriented , like everything in the exhibition , to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , where their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past , I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg of the portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was hiding behind its liberation . &quot;
Professor of the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of Oxford University for killing
&quot; a nationwide chase is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee at Oxford University , who became susp@@ ects after a man had been stab@@ bed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries . &quot;
on Monday W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) were issued arrest warran@@ ts for murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au .
&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches . &quot;
a joint warning system published by the Police Authority of Chicago states that the body was discovered on July 27 .
&quot; officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead in the place of the action , and det@@ ectives insp@@ ect the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police are actively searching for the two susp@@ ects , officials said . &quot;
La@@ them has been Professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University since 2007 .
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the vice @-@ president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail explaining that La@@ them should now be overwhel@@ med and excluded from entering the Campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal affair that is examined by the competent authorities , and the Nor@@ th@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
a spokesman for the university and the Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the US investig@@ ative authorities in any way possible .
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and wanted him to stand .
&quot; chief Communications Officer of the Police Authority of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he strongly urge the susp@@ ects to face the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police have an idea of their place of residence , and our efforts to locate them strengthen , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious hint saying that something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 . &quot;
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
security cameras confirmed that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said . &quot;
&quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation to the residents : &quot; &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and explores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will conclude the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mut@@ ko &quot;
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it will not take long to implement the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) for the restoration of the Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ dop@@ ing ) . &quot;
&quot; the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the PM comm@@ ited the second part of the WA@@ DA road@@ map to comply with the code , which describes the criteria for the restoration of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and was recently published on the website of the Organization . &quot;
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia . &quot;
&quot; everything was announced , everything is being implemented . &quot;
&quot; the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; however , one of the criteria mentioned in the list shows that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities have to publicly accept the results of the investigation approved by the WA@@ DA by Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren to alleged feder@@ ally funded dop@@ ing in Russian sports . &quot;
&quot; regarding the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has made a mistake . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there were no government programmes , and we will not admit something that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; mut@@ ex &apos;s words coinci@@ ded with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the head of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with the Russian sales outlet r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov gave problems to the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; Sm@@ ir@@ nov said . &quot;
&quot; in November 2015 , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was expelled from the WA@@ DA by the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia in November 2015 . &quot;
&quot; however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( U@@ K@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; after a visit to the headquarters of the Moscow organisation in July , WA@@ DA Director General Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moved &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again . &quot;
Al@@ di does not sell eggs for the time being

&quot; it was a mere precau@@ tion , it could further be assumed by no health impairment , it was said in the message . &quot;

start @-@ ups that will help your company not become the next U@@ ber
&quot; A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure luck with your employees at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys did not work . &quot;
&quot; answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ently . &quot;
&quot; and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce hair care company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot;
it has called people from outside for help .
a new Human Resources Start @-@ Up race is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel .
&quot; by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement , it enables companies to offer surveys , offer specialist groups and demographic groups , and in some cases allow whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers to b@@ ypass the C @-@ Suite leaders and turn directly to the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; you now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ LIN@@ T , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement . &quot;
Er@@ ret@@ t said they have a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ LIN@@ T .
&quot; in addition to the snap @-@ poll@@ s and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat map of the company that shows which units have most complaints and which managers have low feedback results - so that you can drill , why . &quot;
&quot; companies come to see that they have to stay at the top of the workplace culture so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als , since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of nu@@ is@@ ance where those who have spoken have been punished . &quot;
&quot; for start @-@ ups like G@@ LIN@@ T , this desire for an overview is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity . &quot;
&quot; global governance , regulation and compliance sector could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion by 2020 , following the fin@@ anz@@ technical website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , which helps companies prevent bad behavior and recognize , saw increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the midst of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ ver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
U@@ ber has recently signed up as a client .
&quot; like G@@ LIN@@ T , Con@@ ver@@ cent lets companies send customized &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas . &quot;
&quot; it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line , which allows employees to report bad behavior . &quot;
&quot; and if the main business leader is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board . &quot;
&quot; the Court of Public Opinion has captured the regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , founder and managing director of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; if a company is found that treats its employees badly or beha@@ ves in@@ eth@@ ically , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee turnover and complaints , said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 sites , Con@@ ver@@ cent has used more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters . &quot;
&quot; earlier , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often an in@@ timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el , who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees . &quot;
&quot; now that the company uses Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that were previously hidden by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states could be identified and addressed more quickly - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair intern@@ ships . &quot;
&quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience of employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who leads the Risk Management Group of Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment li@@ tigation . &quot;
&quot; company began to take ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 more seriously after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed due to ethical violations by the En@@ ron scandal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said . &quot;
but it took until the &quot; Social Media came to their right &quot; that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry on @-@ line .
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
both G@@ LIN@@ T and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service and debit the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance that will find the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start @-@ ups .
&quot; Con@@ ver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November of B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners , bringing total funding to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; these investments are hardly surprising given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their workplaces than before .
&quot; in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only st@@ akes . &quot;
employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; when people are happy to be in a company that hears their voices and that the work they do is worthwhile , then they feel more committed to making this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ LIN@@ T . &quot;
investors reach returns when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and engaged .
&quot; if the third @-@ party analytics tools promise to increase commitment and commitment to employees , it is no wonder that you will find support . &quot;
the data about employee engagement according to the experts in the workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the administrators of a company do not take action .
&quot; in fact , when a company asks employees for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the change is not fast enough or not at all , dis@@ appointments can grow and de@@ motiv@@ ate employees . &quot;
&quot; if you ask about 4,000 suggestions , you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management Company of Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that rely too much on collecting data . &quot;
&quot; because if you don &apos;t follow your employees , &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; and if you don &apos;t care about it , why should I ? &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now performs monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate actions on the same day when a problem about G@@ LIN@@ T is reported , so saved . &quot;
&quot; after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems . &quot;
&quot; with Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company always receives new insights on the employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better binding of workers in an industry known for high turnover . &quot;
&quot; if you are not oblig@@ ated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , then you will lose companies . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the Brotherhood
&quot; it starts at 11 o &apos;clock , when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA football players enter@@ tain on one side of the new training fields of the team on campus . &quot;
some have pulled out their tri@@ cot parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
&quot; for a good part of the team , these un@@ active minutes are a lunch break . &quot;
players who are enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final examinations after the three hour exercise before returning to the Water@@ man Football Center next morning .
&quot; that &apos;s for the boys the next three days a real treadmill , &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before the Monday became Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to ease the load of the players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should begin at 7 : 15 p.m. to meet the already packed schedule of the players . &quot;
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bru@@ ins moved the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six playing times in West@@ wood practi@@ sed practical exercises .
&quot; 20 minutes before the start of the formal game preparations for their pr@@ elu@@ de against Texas A &amp; M , they will be held in September . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ a said that he supports the change in the rules of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players . &quot;
&quot; we put this enormous strain on her three or four days and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they just pushed it through , they pl@@ unge on , they &apos;re great people . &quot;
&quot; I think as soon as we get to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ C@@ LA will stop its practice as soon as the camp is over , which in view of the clear sight of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of up@@ scale class that has already been ki@@ cked off with foot@@ balls , which will be a safety net behind a door@@ posts , no easy task . &quot;
&quot; Bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people are renting a room and then set up to record an exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you have the vide@@ ot@@ ape from an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal . &quot;
but we have security forces there and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t worry too much about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts @-@ check in the fight against fake messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to third parties and show their results below the original contribution then the world &apos;s largest online social network announced on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to combat so @-@ called fake news .
the company said in a statement on his website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to identify possible false noti@@ fications and send them to fac@@ tual audi@@ tors that may show results of the fact check out of the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the major distribution points for so @-@ called fake news that many believe that they have also influenced the US presidential elections in 2016 .
&quot; the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters being flooded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany is supporting a plan that social media networks should be punished if they fail to quickly remove h@@ asser@@ filled posts like before the elections there in September . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in German that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany a test of the new facts review will be started . &quot;
&quot; in addition to finding out which stories are challenged by third parties , people want more context in order to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Product Manager for Facebook news in a blog . &quot;
&quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the &quot; &quot; related article &quot; &quot; and works on other changes to its news feed to reduce false news . &quot;
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
&quot; in his recent past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was to be seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 &apos;s and 1980 @-@ s . &quot;
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from its cozy seat in the Consci@@ ous River Valley in K@@ ent , and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ i@@ v Yor@@ k@@ shire with a pre@@ dile@@ ction for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I find it so nice to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says wi@@ st@@ fully . &quot;
what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England spann@@ ed the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Ste@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isa@@ bel Gre@@ enberg . &quot;
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des that is based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; - a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotional .
&quot; I only responded to the thumb print on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is his thumb print !
&quot; and letters always smell like smoke , for at that time they lit a fire because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it were itself . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome greeting ) this is all too nice to be true .
&quot; Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &apos; new &apos; castle , to look through the archives and study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ena on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the tren@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; he wander@@ ed through the area and the ruins of the old castle , and spoke with landscape fans , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he drank &quot; whis@@ key &quot; and started writing . &quot;
&quot; the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust received full access until 2006 , when the last heir , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died . &quot;
&quot; when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just started to look after the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristo@@ cr@@ ats said &quot; Oh , throw it down on the attic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Empire , cards that represent what possessed : &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch fighting for the two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let all go of it ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immer@@ se themselves in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the Pe@@ as@@ ant Pe@@ as@@ ant of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of a tur@@ mo@@ il that occurred in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ ghtly Family of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , Rho@@ des says . &quot;
the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought that an insurrection was a good start .
maybe they are connected to each other ? &quot;
&quot; other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ rons which the family Dar@@ r@@ ell hid for seven years during the English Reformation . &quot;
&quot; or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , in which the smu@@ g@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ r@@ ell is represented in the 18th century , who staged his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery made only years later when his coff@@ in was dug out ) . &quot;
&quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos; favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; the gentlemen seemed to be a cro@@ ok , always making debts and spending money for things they could not afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ r@@ ell men solved their school crises by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a he@@ ap of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to adverti@@ se land@@ slide . &quot;
&quot; after the end of his deployment in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique write @-@ experiences &quot;
&quot; he has spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ män@@ mä@@ ki , the grounds of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; Ah , now I have to deal with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle covered in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the v@@ eiling of the 30@@ 1 year old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f started its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) .
mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team led by Nelson Ar@@ tz want to keep the logo and slogan secret until Thursday .
&quot; at the end of August , it will be the highlight of the campaign to be a feast on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ ver@@ th . &quot;
&quot; too nice for us .
&quot; or ? &quot; &quot; the makers of the action have been asking for the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer chapel yesterday . &quot;
&quot; we do not really think that ( of course ! ) , they write on their website yesterday . &quot;
but we use this measure to attract your attention .
and to make it clear that many things are better than it seems .
&quot; basically , we are convinced that as a bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizens we are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
&quot; the action is about more than &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , that is to say . &quot;
&quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all @-@ embra@@ cing promise , one that gives the city a unique unique selling proposition . &quot;
&quot; finally , they stand in competition with other municipalities . &quot;
the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f allows the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f to cost a medium @-@ five @-@ digit amount and the campaign costs .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
&quot; every year at the beginning of August , Ankara is advis@@ ing the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) about retirement and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps . &quot;
so also this week .
at first glance a normal operation .
but nothing is a routine for the Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt .
&quot; the meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff , as was previously , but in the office of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; under the presi@@ dency of the Prime Minister , the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs Minister also took part in the discussions . &quot;
this resulted in the number of civilians in the Y@@ AS .
the government pul@@ ls up the re@@ ins in the military .
&quot; the Chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the Army , the Air Force and the Navy were dismissed . &quot;
&quot; since the failed coup , President Erdo@@ gan has fired 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als . &quot;
&quot; more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged links to the movement of the exile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which Erdo@@ gan sees as the wi@@ re@@ actor of the coup attempt . &quot;
4@@ 86 people who have been involved in the coup attempt have been negotiated in Ankara since this week .
&quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had called the overthrow attempt as a &quot; &quot; gift of God &quot; , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to completely clean the armed forces . &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really handle the army ?
&quot; at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ e@@ as@@ iness in the Military Head@@ quarters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the general staff there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the lifting of the head@@ scar@@ f ban for soldiers , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the massacre of the army and the security forces continues . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan fired more than 73@@ 95 heads of state , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers . &quot;
it seemed as though Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were earlier than the actual Lor@@ ds of the country .
three times they put@@ ted their role as guar@@ dians of the secular state order .
&quot; following his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan pushed back the power of the military step by step , not least by calling on the reform agenda of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say Erdo@@ gan is specifically driving an Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; a particularly un@@ named officer , who sought asylum from fear of persecution in foreign countries , warned that the Turkish army would be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and sal@@ a@@ fi@@ sts in a few years . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if this happens , such a development could not leave NATO cold . &quot;
&quot; anyway , in the alliance after the pur@@ ges there are doubts about the readiness of the Turkish army . &quot;
&quot; the leadership structures and operational skills are &quot; weakened , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington Chan@@ ges the Green Card Rules
&quot; there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted by the media . &quot;
&quot; it envis@@ ages lowering the legal immigrants to 50,000 a year , stric@@ ter regulations for obtaining vis@@ as for temporary work permit and restrictions on family @-@ oriented vis@@ as . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill should be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pa@@ yers and will do so by the United States to change the way citizens from other countries are issued Green Cards . &quot;
the law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English , who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media . &quot;
Ministry wants to rehabil@@ itate circuit for road driving
&quot; over the past few months , the future of the rac@@ er sh@@ utt@@ les has been cont@@ ested - now it is to go quite quickly . &quot;
&quot; before the end of the year , you will be able to build the route on which the tourist train drives . &quot;
&quot; in order to secure the future of the road tunnel in the long run , construction work will commen@@ ce on the road again this year according to the Ministry of Transport . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to further order and renov@@ ate the Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g route , the country is particularly important for tourism , &quot; said Minister of Transport Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot;
the costs for the repair of the route cost around 2.5 million euros .
&quot; from this sum , the country is over 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , on the basis of which the shuttle should be ordered from the country in the future , is currently being fin@@ alised , stated S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the Ministry and the Süd@@ Thurin@@ gia Bahn as operators are already in agreement with the technical details .
&quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of 11 years .
&quot; in this way , the race car shuttle should be ordered regularly on December 2017 . &quot;
the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle is a popular rail link between the underground stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
&quot; over the past few months , it has been tested in the course of a pilot operation , whether the circuit is used by enough people to order them again in the future . &quot;
the track is also very b@@ ump@@ y in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry
&quot; just as you thought it can &apos;t become even more crazy in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming . &quot;
&quot; yes , actually . &quot;
sex robots are currently a big deal .
the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( FR@@ R ) recently published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years .
&quot; according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Professor of Robot@@ ics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must start taking her ascen@@ sion seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and type of finger nail . &quot;
&quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more often , &quot; said Mr Sh@@ ark@@ ey in the publication of his new report . &quot;
modern sex pupp@@ ets have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can also adjust his robot according to his convic@@ tions , and select everything from the eye color of the robot over the shape of the nip@@ ples to the type or color of his finger@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; but it is even more disturbing since many robots have the &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; that would make a Step@@ ford woman progressive . &quot;
modern sex pupp@@ ets have developed into robots with a silicone skin .
&quot; for example , the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot allows users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Ro@@ bot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed personalities like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which con@@ veys the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild Wend@@ y &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality , which is adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; enth@@ uses the website of True Compan@@ ion . &quot;
&quot; so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the day , she also has her m@@ oods - just like real people ! &quot;
&quot; it can be tired , be fixed on conversation or it can be &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; there are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive female characteristics , the allu@@ sions to rape , when one goes one step to Fri@@ gi@@ d ( called here : reluct@@ ant ) Far@@ rah , rest@@ less one the most . &quot;
&quot; true Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men . &quot;
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men not have Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; it says on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex toy . &quot;
&quot; their formation and increasing refin@@ ement indicate something ha@@ zy and deeper in our culture , towards a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition . &quot;
&quot; most men will , of course , do not hold any sex robots , and while the FR@@ R notes their increasing popularity , they remain at the edge of consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what is perme@@ ated from the marginal zones , can be very instruc@@ tive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live . &quot;
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until the free market is given permission .
&quot; there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots are emerging in a time when the rights of women are threatened worldwide , in which there is a president in the White House who has bo@@ asted to have women sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; the most deter@@ rent aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the hand@@ maid &apos; ) is not the graphic images , the worn body and the out @-@ out eyes , but how realistic this vision works . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap . &quot;
the goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical resem@@ b@@ lance to actual women as realistic as possible ( albeit with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; but , brought to the point when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot;
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
&quot; they have no mediation or background story , nothing that hin@@ ders independence or anything that could distur@@ b the fantasy of total sub@@ ju@@ gation . &quot;
&quot; in other words , they are counter@@ f@@ eit slaves . &quot;
or to express it in the speech of 2017 : ma@@ ids
pumps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy human understanding
&quot; it has become a b@@ ump @-@ wisdom of the Tr@@ ump era that the political divisions , which pol@@ arized the US elec@@ torate , also split families in small format . &quot;
&quot; around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving , there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of dr@@ um@@ ed relatives . &quot;
we are all re@@ port@@ edly committed to letting our filter bubbles burst .
&quot; less noticed is the power of d@@ umps , to bring together families . &quot;
&quot; I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ looking poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York . &quot;
it reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
&quot; with Tr@@ ump in the White House everyone who knows them , including the repub@@ lican relationship with which she had fought for decades for politics , suddenly and completely strange on the same side . &quot;
&quot; this is certainly a good thing for the dining table , but it seems to me that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the dis@@ figur@@ ing effect of his presi@@ dency has the power to push us all to the right . &quot;
&quot; when we speak of &quot; &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump &quot; , &quot; we are referring to the cre@@ ep@@ y possibility that one day his k@@ itt@@ ens will no longer be rep@@ ul@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; there is , however , an even more frigh@@ tening long @-@ term scenario in which Tr@@ ump Repub@@ lic@@ ans of the right wing are &quot; norm@@ alized , &quot; which suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness . &quot;
&quot; I find myself today by an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ur@@ com@@ ical version of the decline - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return ) - both compared to Tr@@ ump in fact occur as a very mild crime . &quot;
&quot; if Tr@@ ump is going , the next candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans must be mentally healthy to qualify as im@@ measurable improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our kids to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ ou@@ sels of the New York Park department , and the best three dollars that you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caffeine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are grow@@ ling and the animals turn to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely glo@@ omy and the climate @-@ per@@ ing music im@@ parts this in a strange way . &quot;
&quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of tall buildings become old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city is not fair to the dream . &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cot@@ tage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the theme pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage is not counting , but a big round@@ about in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; however , the Central Park car@@ ous@@ el still has a strange magic experience since two years old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ er years can go on it and all have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could have rated the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately nobody asked . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , this week I was forced to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house on the corner of my street it &apos;s the same , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter . &quot;
&quot; this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what should be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no one is required . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ ologi@@ zing , while I was tired of the experience to reach her credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain
&quot; for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit . &quot;
&quot; last year , he was brought to the hospital for the treatment of cuts at his w@@ ri@@ sts , which he reported to the prison authorities in a case in his cell . &quot;
&quot; because of murder after an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors , Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first slaughter . &quot;
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning hours of Valentine &apos;s Day by firing them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a .
&quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed he kept his girlfriend for a noc@@ tur@@ nal intru@@ der , who hid himself in the cabin . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention to appeal against the six @-@ year sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , who they say they are too indul@@ gent . &quot;
the National Prosec@@ ution Service said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal could be heard this year .
&quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us is in danger that his sentence will be increased to 15 years , if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful . &quot;
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
when farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
&quot; as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four @-@ se@@ aters were fired from caps and scre@@ e @-@ ho@@ ops during the holidays and in the secondary schools . &quot;
&quot; three of the students will go to secondary school , four to the secondary school . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday evening , An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bi@@ es@@ ental House in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen . &quot;
&quot; the 29 students of the four classes , led by Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der , elected a young eagle who grew up in the h@@ ens &apos; farm , but then released into freedom . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the lower band introduced a musical with the title &quot; The Eagle in the h@@ ens erhof . &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg and let it hat@@ ch from its chickens .
instead of a chicken f@@ owl a small eagle came out .
&quot; but the hope of making a chicken out of it struck , the eagle spread its wings on a high mountain and s@@ wore . &quot;
&quot; after that , classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken tan@@ z . &quot;
&quot; the h@@ ens danced with the young Go@@ ck@@ eln , the cylinders wore to win the bet . &quot;
&quot; the eagle stands for integration , said Schul@@ leader An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte . &quot;
&quot; the young animal is different from the other young ( chi@@ cks ) , but belongs to it . &quot;
but he will never be like a chicken .
his determination is to be free .
she wished everyone that he felt accepted in his new school .
&quot; this was followed by a thank@@ fulness to the colleagues , former school manager Michael Müller , who always jumps in with school@@ children , and the parents &quot; representatives . &quot;
&quot; now the kitchen season is over , the class teacher Sophia Schumacher declared . &quot;
&quot; after two years of teaching , she only disp@@ at@@ ched her students because it was a really great time . &quot;
&quot; finally , they can rely on the districts . &quot;
&quot; finally , all students left a song of summer time and holiday time . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , great joy broke with the children . &quot;
eight first @-@ class students have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
&quot; two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned for illegal camps in Greece , announced the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted on television . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of 1 August , a group of illegal people arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia was arrested by the police , including the two Bulg@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , they were released while an investigation is underway . &quot;
the State Department reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were later released .
&quot; the Greek authorities have sharpen@@ ed control of the free camp and suggest to anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose , considerable fin@@ es . &quot;
check @-@ ups are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court can impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what people now need to know
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers have to participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
&quot; BMW , Daimler , Opel and the Volkswagen Group offer software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars on the diesel summit . &quot;
they should improve the emission level of cars from the Euro 5 emissions classes and some Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin from ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments :
is the new action mandatory ?
no . the software updates negotiated are voluntary .
&quot; the mandatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles that have the Schum@@ an Software , &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
their retro@@ fitting has arranged the Federal Aviation Office ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
&quot; the manufacturers announced a rapid implementation in the coming months , but not yet called an exact date . &quot;
Daimler advised to write to any person affected .
&quot; if an inspection is due anyway , this will be done in their framework . &quot;
how long will the conver@@ sions go down altogether ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
the hang@@ ings depend on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from the political pressure .
&quot; for we have seen , voluntarily the autom@@ akers do not act on the topic of the environment so far . &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the change@@ over itself could last only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming could be to get an appointment .
&quot; what do mot@@ orists who do not drive cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ? &quot;
the ACE advises to wait .
&quot; presumably , foreign manufacturers would consult S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
what is the threat of a massive price drop of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE fears that .
but just in the regions where driving b@@ ans are threatening .
&quot; in rural areas , there is currently no loss of value for older diesel . &quot;
the ACE advises to wait for sale .
ll Cool J gets Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glam@@ orous events in Washington .
the first award ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to be political .
one of the winners does not want to come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to receive one of the prestigious awards from the renowned Kennedy Center .
&quot; as the cultural institution announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ographer Carmen de Lav@@ al@@ lade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) are among the scholars . &quot;
the awards will be handed over at the beginning of December .
&quot; traditionally , US President Donald Tr@@ ump will host a reception and participate in the award together with his wife Mel@@ ania . &quot;
the prize winner Le@@ ar announced with progressive TV shows already announced that he would refrain from participating in the gala .
&quot; he said , &quot; This presi@@ dency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - and even depri@@ ve them of the means - and that puts strain on me . &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an emphasized that she will use Tr@@ ump to make clear her view .
&quot; Kennedy &apos;s centre , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital . &quot;
&quot; the former award winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing . &quot;
we make the city liv@@ able
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ lach city building master , goes to retirement in the coming year . &quot;
&quot; the place is already written , but suitable candidates are rare . &quot;
W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has been a city builder for 31 years .
and the work still makes him great fun as he medi@@ ates in the press brief@@ ing .
&quot; he reports from diverse , but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , it is surprising that so far no application has fulfilled the requirement profile . &quot;
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
&quot; in this way , considering the regular periods of notice , there should be enough time for a famili@@ ar@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; since Has@@ lach is responsible for the administrative community as a sub @-@ contractor , the applicant has to draw the relevant conclusions . &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
&quot; if it would no longer be able to fill it out , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for advice . &quot;
&quot; but close proximity to the town and to him is important , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working atmosphere and a good mood between authority and citizen . &quot;
&quot; in more than 30 years in office , some major projects have accumulated , which W@@ acker looks back with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city liv@@ able , &quot; he is confident about the building department and its employees . &quot;
but also in the future varied projects are on the agenda : the res@@ hap@@ ing of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a are@@ als and the Nieder@@ hof parking space for example are initiated .
&quot; the bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium renovation is still a topic . &quot;
&quot; the latter will be able to book about 1.5 million euros , &quot; if we do it correctly , &quot; W@@ acker estimates . &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
&quot; in terms of design , there is great clearance for a city builder . &quot;
&quot; with Has@@ lach &apos;s own building yard and gardening , it is possible to react to many things quite flexibly . &quot;
&quot; one can move much , &quot; said W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned lau@@ ingly by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; as the old town as an ensemble is under monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye for what is going on , &quot; when new buildings are approved , the reti@@ ring city builder emphasizes . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister carries a high level of responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; in the end everything is going well above my table . &quot;
&quot; with care and coordination , he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been there for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) has been working for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; also , that his successor remains long , W@@ acker wishes : &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to be identified and left with the job . &quot;
&quot; continuity is not only important for a good working climate , but also for the further design of the city . &quot;
anyone who wants to inher@@ it Roland W@@ acker should have a completed degree as a graduate engineer or a bach@@ elor &apos;s degree in architecture according to the city of Has@@ lach and have good expertise in the fields of building and construction planning law .
&quot; the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt ( Stadt@@ bau@@ amt ) is subject to civil and civil engineering , building guidelines , residential properties , administration of urban properties , urban depot with building yard and urban gardening , as well as the civil rights authority , including monument protection . &quot;
bike thrown on lines : southern track closed
&quot; according to the police , the previously unknown perpetr@@ ators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railroad tracks in the area of the Le@@ oben Street ( B@@ 116 ) onto the lines . &quot;
these were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go from two male perpetr@@ ators and have been searching for them since the night .
&quot; near the scene of the crime , a pink sco@@ oter and a bicycle driver were observed by witnesses . &quot;
&quot; this goes far beyond a Lus@@ ati@@ an Empire , &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokesman Christoph Pos@@ ch to the AP@@ A . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ators , or the perpetr@@ ators , would have put themselves in danger and also end@@ anger the traffic . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant , as well as the delay and the cost of rail transport , P@@ ön@@ alen will also be able to respond to the perpetr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; overall , the spokesman said . &quot;
&quot; the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the south railway line could be led without disabilities . &quot;
&quot; almost ten passenger trains had dropped out on Friday morning , two of which were related to the long @-@ distance traffic . &quot;
&quot; freight trains did not fall out , but they had delays . &quot;
&quot; according to Ö@@ BB spokesman Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 meters of overhead lines had to be replaced . &quot;
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease ) &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
&quot; but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
&quot; the incur@@ able condition affecting around 1.3 million and in the United Kingdom 300@@ ,000 causes stomach cra@@ mps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme fatigue . &quot;
researchers at the Wash@@ ing@@ ton@@ er University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han contributes to the development of immune cells that promote a tolerant gut .
&quot; the senior researcher , Dr Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells in the gut pat@@ rol in order to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in food do not penetrate the body . &quot;
&quot; cells that are capable of tri@@ g@@ gering inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body , without damaging sensitive tissues . &quot;
&quot; if the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
experiments have been found that a type of tolerance promoting immune cells occurs in mice that carry a specific bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - in order to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have established a link between a species of bacteria - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the mice in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. Cru@@ ter@@ i and an diet that is rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han , encourages more tolerant , less inflammatory bow@@ el mi@@ li@@ eus when the same system is also working with people . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ doctoral researcher Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan investigated a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was but separated , this did not have . &quot;
&quot; it assumed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ous mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; the intest@@ ines of the mice were sequ@@ enced , and six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells were found , but were missing in mice . &quot;
&quot; mice were wound up in a sterile environment , so that an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome was missing and they did not develop this kind of immune cells , and they received the L. Cru@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells . &quot;
&quot; in order to understand how the bacteria imp@@ acted on the immune system , the researchers L. Cru@@ ter@@ i were able to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells isolated from the mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed into the tolerant cells .
&quot; when the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it proved to be a by@@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism , known as an i@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid . &quot;
&quot; if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the food of mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but if the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that people have the same tolerant cells as mice , and that most of us are helping L. Cru@@ ter@@ i in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ by@@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in humans with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; potentially , high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an expansion of this population . &quot;
&quot; Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United is committed to &quot; &quot; genius &quot; &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic &quot;
&quot; at Manchester United has signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million pound of signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup begins against Real Madrid on Tuesday , and impressed in the pen role , as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched at will . &quot;
&quot; however , matic was excluded from the prepar@@ atory Asia tour of the blues and only managed 45 minutes to improve M@@ our@@ in@@ ho that he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; M@@ our@@ in@@ ho said . &quot;
we will help him sooner than later .
&quot; in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started in the Avi@@ va Stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho formed the start @-@ XI for the start of the season . &quot;
&quot; this week the Independent revealed that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho wanted three more new commitments , but he insisted that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to meet three of his four primary new commitments . &quot;
&quot; three out of four , for that I thank the association , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have made great effort . &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
&quot; the pilots flew off Seattle in the US state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state Mich@@ ig@@ an and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometers . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens the shape of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
&quot; in the past , Boeing had made such an advertisement . &quot;
so the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky .
&quot; new blow for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem &quot;
&quot; as the wind turns out : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still SPD boss , Social @-@ Democratic Prime Minister had always looked for Berlin with a certain concern . &quot;
&quot; only no fire from the party centre , but no head@@ wind from the Con@@ federation , was the most important desire of the electoral campaig@@ ners . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has fundamentally changed . &quot;
&quot; since then , the staff from Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus closely monitor the events in the provincial capitals of the German Democratic Republic . &quot;
&quot; what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year , would not be described in the approach with head@@ winds . &quot;
it was deep .
and one after another .
&quot; after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against coalition of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; this once again shows : red @-@ green cannot be reliably ruled out , &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber to the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) has over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) in a serious crisis .
&quot; five months before the state elections , his red @-@ green coalition lost its single @-@ vote majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the Green federal managing director Michael Kell@@ ner called on El@@ ke T@@ life@@ jackets to give back their mandate .
the transition to CD@@ U means a clear distortion of the elec@@ torate &apos;s will .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ life@@ jackets must immediately return her mandate , &quot; &quot; said the Federal Executive Officer and election campaign manager of the Green Party of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; this must not be true , &quot; &quot; an SPD election campaig@@ ner si@@ ghs when the new hi@@ jac@@ king message reaches the party centre on Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands for the transition from the green de@@ pu@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ life@@ jackets to the CD@@ U without its own government majority . &quot;
it is the preliminary climax of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD state associations .
and nobody knows what &apos;s next .
the misery began with the unexpectedly sharp defeat at the Saar@@ land election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , no more , the comrades at that time reas@@ sured . &quot;
&quot; after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different . &quot;
that &apos;s what it became - and everything got much worse .
&quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into a mar@@ row , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te fl@@ ared the party smoothly . &quot;
comrades in the weeks afterwards lab@@ ori@@ ously ra@@ cked up again .
&quot; then , when they had just hat@@ ched new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg . &quot;
and with him came the next blow .
&quot; mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD in the SPD , lost his Nim@@ bus on that weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city burned . &quot;
&quot; and because in the crisis communication he did everything wrong , which can be done wrong . &quot;
&quot; since then , Schol@@ z is fighting for his political survival . &quot;
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
&quot; due to the VW exhaust aff@@ aires and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Saxony &apos;s Prime Minister has been in criticism for a long time . &quot;
some survey values were added .
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps precisely for this reason , Wei@@ l has always tried to set accents in the Bund in recent weeks . &quot;
&quot; the efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand its power in Berlin , too , did not remain hidden in the context of Martin Schulz . &quot;
&quot; they let him go , because they spoke of Wei@@ l a stabili@@ zation of the party . &quot;
now the exact opposite could occur .
&quot; at the same time , Wei@@ l meets the non @-@ party constra@@ int of the Lower Saxon Gre@@ ens in essence no fault . &quot;
and Schulz was not at all .
&quot; in the meantime , the comrades endeav@@ our to keep their own ranks closed . &quot;
&quot; their anger is directed toward the Gre@@ ens , and here above all , to the back@@ sliding ent@@ eri@@ ess T@@ v@@ est . &quot;
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , as Mrs. T@@ v@@ ester places her own career fairs on the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; Ms. T@@ life@@ jackets is not elected as a direct candidate because of her person , but has been elected to parliament over the country list of the Lower Saxon Gre@@ ens , according to the de@@ pu@@ ties of Lower Saxony . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns to her mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , lam@@ ents an &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the voters of voters four years ago were clear : people made Stephan Wei@@ l the prime minister , &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as a top candidate into the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; the personal career of a future CD@@ U de@@ pu@@ ties now distor@@ ts the election result , &quot; Op@@ per@@ mann said . &quot;
he called for clari@@ fying the background .
I want to know if there has been more or there have been further commitments of the CD@@ U Nieder@@ sachsen .
funding for local politicians III
those who want to renov@@ ate their home in the years can soon get support from the country .
&quot; in addition , mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of St@@ eg city development were informed on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ in@@ dler offered once again a review of what happened . &quot;
&quot; since 1991 , there have been sensi@@ ti@@ sed areas of rehabilitation . &quot;
&quot; at that time , in the refurb@@ ishment area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land of Baden @-@ Württemberg had taken over two thirds of the funding amount . &quot;
&quot; in the refurb@@ ishment area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy still remained at 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the previous refur@@ bish@@ ments are a &quot; &quot; successful project &quot; &quot; - it is important to also promote interior development , and not only to open up new construction areas . &quot;
&quot; on April 4 , the Information received from the Pres@@ i@@ dency of Karlsruhe will be given that there will be a refurb@@ ishment area III . &quot;
&quot; the total funding amount amounted to € 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 , of which 500,000 Euros are from the country , the rest of the community &apos;s feelings . &quot;
how does a refurb@@ ishment area develop ?
&quot; so Sch@@ in@@ dler will continue to investigate where the &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot;
but it also plays a role whether there is any interest in the planned area .
&quot; if necessary , the territorial boundaries could then shift again . &quot;
&quot; the bridge represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel on Wednesday evening . &quot;
&quot; Keller presented the contents of the &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; federal government programme in which the renovation would then be carried out . &quot;
&quot; the core of the program is the rev@@ ital@@ isation of inner cities , improving the living and working conditions , and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would be taken object @-@ related , that is , per plot . &quot;
the refurb@@ ishment area would then eventually be defined as a stat@@ ute .
&quot; since January 1 , 2017 , the grant period for the funding is still running until April 30 , 20@@ 26 . &quot;
&quot; until September of this year , however , the stock@@ taking would only be carried out , within the framework of which the participants involved in the rehabilitation area receive a questionnaire for filling out . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , the order of the sentence is to be carried out as soon as possible , in order to begin with the renovation in the coming year . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann stated that every municipality had to carry out the said preliminary investigations . &quot;
the aim is to evaluate the urban gri@@ ev@@ ances and decide when to refurb@@ ish and to what extent .
&quot; for the respective property , there will also be a refurb@@ ishment note in the basic book . &quot;
&quot; once again , Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come to his senses and make a picture of the situation , she promised . &quot;
&quot; Got@@ zel stressed , an essential factor for success for the project is the participation of those involved . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there will be questionna@@ ires sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be completed by the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; building and property sheet &quot; , &quot; in which it goes among other things about the structural condition and the refurb@@ ishment views . &quot;
&quot; in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; household and housing arch , &quot; information about size , division and residents of a living room can be made . &quot;
the blue &quot; operating arc &quot; is only to be filled when business premises are operated in the building .
&quot; however , to be aware , Got@@ zel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , new construction measures are not eligible . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ in@@ dler also stressed that the distribution of funds in accordance with the &quot; &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; &quot; - who comes first , first ad@@ mon@@ ishes . &quot;
you cannot reserve funds for later . &quot;
&quot; finally , photos of the project &quot; &quot; Centre II &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a &quot; tasty &quot; renovation . &quot;
British inventor sets himself a micro@@ chip to come with a hand movement in house and car
&quot; a British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip , so that he can open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement . &quot;
&quot; Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and foref@@ inger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he has partner@@ ed with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , a consulting an@@ aes@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist at the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standard . &quot;
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
&quot; the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the locks on houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for a surcharge of £ 300 per lock . &quot;
the married father of one has now installed both at home and his BMW Z@@ 4 technology which begins when his hand is on the wheel .
the advertising costs of the White House cost the tax@@ pa@@ yer thousands
&quot; the White House &apos;s decision to fly a Marine helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlighted American manufacturing last month costs tax@@ pa@@ yers according to the data of the military , which were left to the TI@@ ME magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was at the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries . &quot;
&quot; the helicopter manufactured in Connec@@ ti@@ cut has been exhibited alongside a ma@@ ine yacht , a Wis@@ con@@ sin fire truck and a fork lift from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; the military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with a high visibility , &quot; &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to his superior , the Assistant Nav@@ al Commander for Aviation . &quot;
&quot; the message showed that the helicopter arrived on the South La@@ wn on 17 July at 3 o &apos;clock in the morning , and so long remained until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 in this evening . &quot;
the note adds that if the departure from the White House was delayed due to the limitation of service hours a second team would need for the return flight .
&quot; the original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event , while the safety personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the plane . &quot;
&quot; from the records provided by TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required . &quot;
the H@@ atch Act prohi@@ bits federal states to use state property for political purposes .
data sets indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked if the event might hurt the destination .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; the commander wrote . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you &apos;re locked up , &quot; &quot; answered the deputy commander . &quot;
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated as an official event by the White House and was not covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the President gave an impetus to the reform of health reforms going on in the Senate and he propag@@ ated the efforts to cur@@ b government regulations . &quot;
&quot; the use of the aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon for politically advantageous purposes . &quot;
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the journey .
&quot; however , their use only for a photo operation is unusual . &quot;
&quot; in February , Tr@@ ump carried out an investigation when the presidential plane landed in front of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of news that compla@@ ined about the use of the presidential aircraft by its predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is thrilled by the show &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the Deputy Press Secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 crew often lead training flights around Washington and the South La@@ wn to susp@@ end the US president in the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
&quot; when Tr@@ ump was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 conducted 58 practice land@@ ings in the White House . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event counted during the training requirement of the flight crew for the month , said a civil servant . &quot;
&quot; in addition , helicop@@ ters flew 11 hours this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot; &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pa@@ yers over@@ took the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokesman of Si@@ kor@@ sky said that the company was not involved in issuing the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not maintain budget records for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to the Secretary of Defense Ministry of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per hour . &quot;
unit records record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Quanti@@ co in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pa@@ yers based on estimates for re@@ funds is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual means . &quot;
&quot; according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but consider the costs of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of contract . &quot;
&quot; at this time the former press spokesperson of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the deployment of the helicopter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present things that are produced in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot;
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ ti@@ cut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds if not thousands of people depend on it . &quot;
&quot; and I think , like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly . &quot;
of course it is reasonable to emphasize that .
&quot; it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump was inter@@ acting with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire truck . &quot;
&quot; in the White House , Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products . &quot;
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW ne@@ uss in front of a kne@@ ading task
the championship leader of the Second Tennis League will join the third championship in Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
&quot; tomorrow , the TC blue @-@ white Ne@@ uss enters the third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V from 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel . &quot;
&quot; despite the five games still flaw@@ less , the leader of the Second Tennis League has gained the sense of the reality . &quot;
team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has respect for the opponent at any rate .
this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation .
especially at the post@@ erior positions I find the crew very good . &quot;
&quot; for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V , the imports come from the high North . &quot;
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even point to the Davis Cup .
&quot; and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay looking at Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Finland ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ swi@@ us ( all Denmark ) . &quot;

r@@ ô@@ le backwards : the city provides 46 kitchen aid
the city itself organis@@ es the K@@ ita lunch table itself .
with fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
&quot; in the city &apos;s day care centers , the clock is turned back . &quot;
&quot; on September 1 , the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the provision of food in the municipal kinder@@ garten facilities ( Kit@@ as ) . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy director of the youth welfare department , this is a good news : &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot;
cooking continues to be out of the house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and ch@@ illed freshly cooked .
&quot; the city operates 46 day@@ care centers in the Kre@@ feld area , in 44 the children get a hot meal at lun@@ ch@@ time . &quot;
&quot; last year , 28@@ 00 children sat at the tables , and the demand grew steadily . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , not only children who are cared for 45 hours of the week are served in the K@@ ita at lunch , &quot; explains Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot;
the offer is also valid for 35 @-@ hour care when children stay up to 14 o &apos;clock .
&quot; 46 Parti@@ al @-@ time employees have kitchen service from 1 September : they warm up the supplied food , supplement it with salad , raw food and fruit , divide the meal individually , clean the meal , clean , rinse and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; employees are permanently assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; Pom@@ er@@ anz says . &quot;
the size - there are two groups as well as seven @-@ group facilities - decides on the ho@@ ur@@ ly circum@@ ference .
&quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers are now firmly a member of the K@@ ita team , &quot; Pom@@ mer@@ anz says . &quot;
&quot; thus they are much more integrated , and it is easier for the hospital to implement educational concepts . &quot;
that &apos;s why it &apos;s all about eating healthy eating and cooking lessons .
the children are supposed to help prepare the food .
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is reasonable .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a known force in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the cleaning of the K@@ ita premises - up to now also the function of the kitchen workers - will be done by special cleaning personnel .
&quot; this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - also has the charm , which it turned out to be the most economical in the price comparison between the owner &apos;s own reg@@ ie and foreign exchange for the city as the most economical , is called the press office . &quot;
&quot; and that , although 46 part @-@ time powers are newly hired . &quot;
&quot; but these hours are not so much the weight of about 750 people in the education sector , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ dance . &quot;
&quot; Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN &quot;
&quot; elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the chief of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Nicholas Hay@@ om , President of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women are running in the provinces . three women run for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women . &quot;
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot;
elections can only be representative and credible if women participate fully and be included in all parts of the election process .
Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on 5 April .
the Taliban issued threats against an election process that coinci@@ ded with the transition from international combat operations to an advisory role .
&quot; this year , for the first time , the elections will be handed over peac@@ efully from a democr@@ atically elected government to the next . &quot;
Hay@@ om said that a strong role for women will strengthen the democratic success of Afghanistan .
the Afgh@@ an Independent Elec@@ toral Commission reports that 1.2 million women were registered with a total of 3.6 million registered voters .

G@@ MB concern about investments at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glas@@ gow
a union would like to make sure the long @-@ term commitment to production at its plant in Glas@@ gow to managers of the bis@@ cuit manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
G@@ MB Scotland said the company was silent about the future of investment in the T@@ oll@@ cross location .
&quot; more than 500 employees work in the plant , which is produced alongside other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and Rich Tea bis@@ cuits . &quot;
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
he added that employees and trade union representatives would &quot; experience first &quot; if their activities would change .
&quot; in a letter to the head of the company , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s request to express &quot; concerns that financing for the modernis@@ ation of production lines would not be pushed forward . &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB senior organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; &quot; the fact that we cannot gain clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross is concerned by our members . &quot;
&quot; generations of families have worked here and labour power is concentrated strongly on the local community and Glas@@ gow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the background of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glas@@ gow is in urgent need of a thri@@ ving production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; the manager at T@@ oll@@ cross has only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will react directly to it , as we estimate the ongoing commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the employees that , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and in@@ secure economic climate , we constantly review our business - and this applies to all our business units and locations - to remain competitive . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ booth site , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognise the legacy of T@@ oll@@ cross as a place of production fully and entirely . if our operations are changing at the site , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona be warned three years ago in front of N@@ ey@@ mar ?
the side of La League may regret their interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not be missed in its persecution by N@@ ey@@ mar , after having issued an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to release its release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago before the world record ? &quot;
&quot; the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer , because the League 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba returned last season for 89 million pounds to Manchester United . &quot;
&quot; after finishing , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest @-@ paying professional athlete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of over 500,000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way to the outside , although there is a source near the Catal@@ ans Board that the club has always given his best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 . &quot;
but was the football world warned three years ago by the PS@@ G President before this prospect ?
&quot; when Manchester City 2014 expressed interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , we &apos;ll be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but if they try to make one of our players sign up , this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish association expressed interest in the PS@@ G mid @-@ field player Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to tear it down under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price deals for N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot;

&quot; interview : &quot; &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Report reli@@ eves Pope Brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Report on the abuse of abuse reli@@ eves the Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussion .
&quot; Christian Wei@@ sn@@ den , spokesman for the reform movement &quot; Wir sind Kirche &quot; ( &quot; Wir sind Kirche &quot; ) , said after publication to the German press agency , he expected from the former Regensburg bishop and present Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and the Cathedral Choir of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology . &quot;
it would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their false app@@ rais@@ al of the processes at that time .
&quot; on the other hand , the Vatican paper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; critic@@ ised that reporting on violence in the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen could be measured with &quot; double standards . &quot; &quot;
&quot; no one doub@@ ted concerning the attacks in Regensburg that it was &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts , &quot; which would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; but striking is the &quot; degree of media manipulation , &quot; says the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , Histori@@ an and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee . &quot;
&quot; the habit of den@@ ying the Catholic Church as the source of all ev@@ ils is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot;
Princess Gl@@ oria von Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis said in an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; we like to go to the church and that &apos;s a bon@@ fire . &quot;
&quot; she also pointed out that in her youth , &quot; &quot; blows &quot; &quot; had been a very normal educational tool , &quot; &quot; to be done with che@@ ek@@ y children , as I was one . &quot;
&quot; it would be unfair to apply today &apos;s standards to earlier decades , as the world has changed . &quot;
&quot; in connection with the reports on the abuse of abuse , the Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared . &quot;
&quot; completely wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who auth@@ ored the memory book &quot; My brother of the pop@@ e &quot; with R@@ atz@@ inger ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot;
what exactly is written in the 440 @-@ page report submitted by the B@@ ist@@ um Regensburg with the clari@@ fication of the lawyer Ulrich Weber ?
a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s with high plau@@ sibility .
&quot; in the final report it is called Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can be said that in many cases Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. has been used in many cases of physical and psychological violence . &quot;
&quot; in the case of high emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the students could also be more severe . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in contrast to many other accused , many victims have appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore , in numerous cases , even positive memories connect with him . &quot;
&quot; in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in his opinion is reli@@ eved . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; incidents of violent exercise on protective char@@ coal in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; shows a contradictory picture by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , many pupils raise their &quot; humanity . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he also appears as a ch@@ ic@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tion@@ ist who has become tangible to the gre@@ ener if a dom@@ ino doesn &apos;t produce top performance musi@@ cally . &quot;
how do you evaluate this report as a bi@@ ographer ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : if you make the effort and read all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger actually occurs in it . &quot;
he has just been devoted to eight pages and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspicion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases sexual abuse .
the exc@@ esses of violence at the pre @-@ school also took place outside of his sphere of influence .
&quot; you can at best repro@@ ach him , learn from it too late or not take first hints seriously enough . &quot;
&quot; the home gym@@ nasi@@ um in which he was working was felt as literally &quot; &quot; redemption &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; better world &quot; &quot; by practically all respon@@ dents . &quot;
&quot; the broad majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger presents an excellent testimony , &quot; &quot; sincere &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; sincere &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; sincere &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; sincere &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; sincere &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; sincere &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; sincere &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; sincere &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; understanding &quot; , &quot; as highly ben@@ evol@@ ent teachers who regularly nour@@ ished the boys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and candy and &quot; &quot; always surrounded by children &apos;s grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; only a minority compla@@ ins about its perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high emotion@@ ality , which also led to flood break@@ downs . &quot;
&quot; he did not only kne@@ ad with chairs and cast the keys on the floor , but also cast ear fi@@ gs and too che@@ ek@@ y guys on the hair or ears , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for that . &quot;
&quot; to his salvation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the fra@@ il time , the 1960s and 1970s , with parents and teachers . &quot;
do you also know such breeding methods ?
&quot; of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I also experienced this in a secular school , a state school . &quot;
&quot; compared to what is actually happening in this report , namely , the horri@@ fic sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , these are certainly bag@@ at@@ elles . &quot;
one wonders whether it is not to do with his fame and role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI that many media have just pl@@ ung@@ ed on him .
&quot; in the Bavarian Pope , many who have never understood him are still working di@@ lig@@ ently . &quot;
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves George R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
&quot; in the media , the report reported a lot about abuse among the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger responsible for involvement in sexual abuse in the final report also with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : clearly no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults claims to have entrusted himself to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consec@@ rated .
&quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or mother about it , &quot; &quot; said one of those affected , &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot;
&quot; the real problem in educ@@ ating sexual abuse was , however , that most of the victims are silent . &quot;
&quot; if they don &apos;t even trust parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a ch@@ oral leader , who , to a certain extent , would have been a colleague of the perpetr@@ ators . &quot;
how do Dom@@ sp@@ atzen students R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student expressed it like this : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had had timely findings and could have stopped the respective perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; I think it ... also for really absurd to assume that it is imp@@ uted to him ... Bu@@ es have opened in@@ sist@@ ently or even more clearly than in relation to their parents , dormit@@ ory leaders , trust teachers , etc . &quot;
that one speaks with him about sex ... un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the report concludes with the very clear result : &quot; &quot; in the run @-@ up to affected pupils and / or their surroundings , it could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation . &quot;
&quot; so , as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus acqu@@ itted of all co @-@ workers . &quot;
he cannot be accused of preventing or having brought him to an adver@@ t .
&quot; therefore , there is no reason to link his good name with these conflic@@ ting crimes , as unfortunately happened in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media , much of &quot; &quot; Viol@@ ence of Viol@@ ence &quot; &quot; was to be read at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; Look &quot; &quot; in the report . &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem that in reporting everything was mixed and mixed up to a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
but that is exactly what mis@@ use of the report .
&quot; it is separated clean@@ ly : between the pre @-@ school and the high school of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and violence , and , we say , other accus@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; the report also covers incidents from the time since 1945 , so also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not a conductor of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; all the terrible test pedago@@ gy , the cases in which the boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were slan@@ ted and dis@@ cour@@ aged , were all taken at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have to prevail . &quot;
&quot; but with them , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he only got the boys face when they were already at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ nasi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; this was , like most of the witnesses , emphas@@ ise the topic of &quot; &quot; primary school &quot; . &quot; &quot;
one was just happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; paradise &quot; conditions .
what was different on the Dom@@ sp@@ litter gym@@ nasi@@ um ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence . &quot;
&quot; this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; many victims have appreciated the general hum@@ ann@@ ess of R. &quot; and therefore in many cases even combine positive memories with him . &quot;
&quot; in this way , at most , the accus@@ ation remains to have looked away . &quot;
&quot; despite all efforts , the report was able to define only two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pres@@ ch@@ ool . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible , ( so the witness ) did not want to hear anything , and then only around 1993 . &quot;
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consequently cut out his ears in front of the states ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ nasi@@ um , who even re@@ produces the report . &quot;
&quot; in this , he points out that in the pre @-@ school there will continue to practice testing . &quot;
&quot; already in the face of the danger of negative press release , he recommended urgent action . &quot;
&quot; this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , as testing pun@@ ishments were also banned in Bavaria for a long time . &quot;
&quot; before that , they were in a legal grey area , as each one of us knows well . &quot;
&quot; it was also difficult for him to estimate , where the affected might be exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded . &quot;
but you can &apos;t say that he has always looked away .
that is simply not true .
&quot; only in 1980 , the test was officially abol@@ ished in schools in Bavaria . &quot;
Princess Gl@@ oria von Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis claimed that it was unfair to apply today &apos;s educational standards to the time at that time .
how do you see this ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we are talking about the &quot; fall of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; that is , the danger of judging the past of today &apos;s moral standards . &quot;
the princess was right there .
&quot; but this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was ab@@ hor@@ red at all times , and not for what has been done in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , which goes far beyond the practice back then . &quot;
that &apos;s all very aw@@ ful and I &apos;m glad that it will finally work out .
&quot; but at the same time , I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , because all this had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; its means of discipl@@ ining and punishment , i.e. , ear fi@@ gs and hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; as a physical punishment then forbidden , he has also kept strict adher@@ ence to it . &quot;
&quot; which picture of his Regensburg time has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger reproduced in the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
was the subject of a test fine also in the language ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI says from his perspective , there the dom@@ es played only a minor role . &quot;
&quot; in spite of this , I was by no means ref@@ using to lead a strict regi@@ ment there . &quot;
&quot; but this also has to be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without demanding discipline , it would hardly have been possible to form a world tran@@ g institution , true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cuits and sweets alone , the rebel@@ li@@ ous boys do not once again make a great singer and before every success , regardless of what area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming . &quot;
what kind of person did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks with her book ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond that , I met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and again and again experienced as wonderful , hum@@ orous , basic , deeply believing and heart@@ felt people , that one could not imagine that he could only do something to fly . &quot;
&quot; I regularly get in touch with how many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen today , 23 years after his Em@@ eri@@ ding , regularly contact him , visit him , read it - he &apos;s almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those who do not forgive him until today , that he was once strict to them , are clearly in the minority . &quot;
most of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen today are grateful to him for enrich@@ ing their lives and bringing them to the world of music .
&quot; and that he always was a good , father@@ ly teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lovely respect@@ ful person , to which they still look up and worship them today . &quot;
&quot; and please , once again clearly : all that is accused of , are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time . &quot;
we can be glad that we have overcome this time long ago .
&quot; but it is most un@@ just , a man just because he is promin@@ ently and has an even more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
the evil intent behind it is only too obvious .
&quot; the report , which was just published , reli@@ eves him . &quot;
&quot; now the stand would command , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps no one would probably know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace . &quot;
