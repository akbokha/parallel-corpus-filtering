<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards that will change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren-Anstalt where youngsters are to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">"a mine chapel, where it is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel."</seg>
<seg id="4">Farmers cultivate the former cause of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's annoying if maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows this because the car Navi showed a green meadow instead of a stray road.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historical maps of the digital Bavaria-atlases, an offer of the Geoportals Bavarian state government, are anything but up-to-date - but especially informative."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when compared to current online maps.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed since the 19th century in the spread-area of Munich Mercury.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria-Atlas is a patchwork which is not immediately recognized as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the large overview map, more detailed maps, so-called original papers, were incorporated into cities and municipalities."</seg>
<seg id="13">These were produced according to the Bavarian surveying management between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographical survey of Bavaria in order - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"even though the French troops finally withdrew from Lunéville on 9 February 1801, today's neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide map of Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Elector Max IV. Joseph drove the project forward, founded the" Topographic Bureau "- and thus the Bavarian surveying business."</seg>
<seg id="19">The document magazine for Munich dates back to 1856 and is to be found on the website of the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of early / today is the most impressive example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">"one example is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was founded 21 years after the map was created, thus in 1877, as a Munich suburb."</seg>
<seg id="24">"today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the modern Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: in the zooming appears a small-part map with dozens of lines and numbers: hand-written numbered pieces from the so-called" "primitive" "from which the basic tax was deduced."</seg>
<seg id="27">"there are no farmers there today, but small gardeners of the plant" land in the sun. ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"the Theresienwiese, the Oktoberfest site since 1810, was in fact a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert."</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the area of the present district Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only street names on" "Gasteig" "or" "Auf der Lüften" "- but also in large letters" "Irren Anstalt". ""</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at Auerfieldstraße one once locked people with delusions."</seg>
<seg id="33">"in 1858 / 59 the Munich district Irrenanstalt" "Auf der Auer Lüften" "was established there."</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - that psychiatrist, who is brought to the death of King Ludwig II."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was progressive for his time and ended for example the Ankhing of so-called Irren.</seg>
<seg id="36">"in addition, he prohibited the personnel to use violence against the occupants," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen museum, who worked for an exhibition with the institution. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"for 280 patients there was first place, later expanded to 500 places."</seg>
<seg id="38">"at some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in Haarmann in 1905."</seg>
<seg id="39">"since 2006, the Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatry psychiatrists."</seg>
<seg id="40">"in the area of the former Auer Anstalt, young people meet in the Munich Salesianum."</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth hostel with educational establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">"West is the football field of TSV Munich East, east of residential buildings from the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015, the children's house" "Casa Don Bosco" "was erected in an architectural approach to the original construction of the Irrenanstalt, which had been destroyed during the Second World War in bomb attacks."</seg>
<seg id="44">"the Marienplatz was registered in 1856 as the" "main square", "the Kaufingerstrasse was called" Kaufinger Gasse. ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">"in December 1944, the Allies bombed many holes in the city centre."</seg>
<seg id="47">A big one remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the English Institute, small business houses and a mine chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preliminary work and the ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn line will take place on 5 April 2017."</seg>
<seg id="49">"with the slider, the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof."</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights group publishes travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the promotion of coloured people has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri due to the discriminatory policies and racist attacks of the state.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which is supposed to enter into force until 28 August 2017, calls for afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to take special care when travelling through the state, as a number of questionable, racial-based incidents occur in the entire state and be noted here," stated in the Group's opinion. "</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes it more difficult for people to capture discrimination, as well as the law enforcement agencies of the state that disproportionately aim for minorities, caused the group to issue the warning, the NAACP said."</seg>
<seg id="54">They have violations of civil rights that happen to people.</seg>
<seg id="55">"they are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed," said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star. "</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the US.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group cited incidents such as racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no more gasoline during the voyage and was taken into custody by the Missouri police, without being accused of a crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also points to a recent report from the Office of the General Public Prosecutor of Missouri, showing that black motorists in the state are 75 percent more often than whites."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," "said Chapel."</seg>
<seg id="62">People must be ready to bring cash or to let relatives know that they travel through the state.</seg>
<seg id="63">"Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime series, which classifies the state with respect to the number of such violations in the 16th place of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">The warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to accuse a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states had passed immigration laws allowing local law enforcement authorities to arrest people on account of immigration violations, which will contribute to further race profiling."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but lately stakeholders have implemented the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">Electric fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fisherbacher Weidebaun project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU members Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac ordered a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">"at the atrium cemetery of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU-local association met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies."</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann first granted insights into his farm where he managed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as many young kittens and accommodated in five apartments holiday palaces."</seg>
<seg id="72">"for him, the" Black Walder milch "is the alternative marketable way for the milk of his cows, such as Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Feriengäste is exclusively regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">"as he is also BLHV-Chairman of Fisherbach, he called the electric fence project as" "elementary important." ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot generate profit on such steep areas.</seg>
<seg id="76">"the grassland area is a lot of work, much must be processed with the brushcutter."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have to fight here with the conditions and the topography," "said Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003, he took over the parent company and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he did not lead a bio-company."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" the Commune has recognised the importance of the electric fence project and is happy about the leaders "support."</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the cost of 3,000 to 4,000 euros per hectare the farmers would have to be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">It is hoped that the afforestation of the land could be pulled out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they can continue their operation," "said the mayor."</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often criticised for the promotion</seg>
<seg id="84">"in 2013, a total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the open-air area is thus 40 hectares, which must not be forested by at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"of the total cost of 71 500 euros, half was promoted by leader, a quarter carried the municipality of Fischerbach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus, the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of pasture fence."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," "said Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac stressed:" "you do a really good job, without farmers and maidens it is not possible."</seg>
<seg id="90">Also for Peter Weiss it was clear: "best food is produced here."</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Conservation Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables the state funding of pasture-fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is the discontinuation of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The assumption of full take-up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform.</seg>
<seg id="94">"moreover, the area to be encircled must not be smuggling (slope inclination over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation."</seg>
<seg id="95">"the request of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence, is currently underway for the Fishermen's' Weight dezvous Project 2018 '."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the disclosure area is 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 11,000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing sacred anymore?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is taking the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump Regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated argument with Jim Acosta from CNN about the President's proposals for the drastic restriction of legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to be fair, Miller didn't handle the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty-Imites would have infected him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but it resorted to its importance, and in particular the meaning that it was attributed to when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base."</seg>
<seg id="105">"when Miller Acosta complained," I don't want to go to a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world. "</seg>
<seg id="106">"the poem you refer to, which was later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller lies properly properly, but as he said it himself, it's not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary response to the stirring words of Lazarus, the only one in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor:" your weary, your poor, and your oppressed masses who desire to breathe freely, and the miserable waste of your rich coasts. "</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time when the "miserable garbage" was better to see on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Trumpur USA are not welcome.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is indeed a conflict around the meaning of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who used to place her words after her death on the base - knew very well that they took a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture was intended to show the connections between French and American republicanism by presenting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical depiction.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a very different name: mother of the Exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The link between the poem and the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right wing people wanted to change this for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the great writer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of Johannes of the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone, but rather an early neo-conservative, who brings the American flame to the surrounding world:" Lady Liberty is going forward. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not lighten the way into the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh is quite unusual here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is completely and even a question of the point of view of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the greatest imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible voyages on the decks of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"in the truest sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue tells them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">"and this, of course, is not the perspective Miller and Trump ever want to acknowledge."</seg>
<seg id="127">"their torch should not lighten the way, but the hatred that is their only source of power."</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots belonged to the UK team.</seg>
<seg id="130">"the performance director of the United Kingdom's athletics, Neil Black, says that the 16-strong Scottish contingent in the world championship cadre will make a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017 which kicks off on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">Black believes that "in Scotland something special develops" and the athletics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it and we try to understand it, and we will continue it until we find out," Black said. "</seg>
<seg id="134">I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think that it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type at the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butler - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track while Eilidh Doyle was elected from the team to the team captain."</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">"their Captain's speech was incredible," Black says. "</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh naturally brought in were great.</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will compete in their fifth world championships at the 400 m hurdles, says it is" unbelievable, "that 16 Scots are in the British team."</seg>
<seg id="145">"Scotland's best total athlete at the World Championship was seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015."</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle-distance runner Muir leads this way and last year he set up five British and two European records.</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runners."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman who was to watch the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers her first world championships as the only other Scotsman in Team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the team captain says that she is" hugely proud "of the fact that many of her fellow countrymen are not only part of the team, but in some cases also mingle with the medals and the finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my teammate voted for me and chose me makes it something special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I'm very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team."</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb on podiums."</seg>
<seg id="155">Concerning my speech as captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think she went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there.</seg>
<seg id="160">Block critics on Facebook: do not host a public office if you cannot tolerate the introduction of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something from bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the papers struck him because of everything, from domestic politics to its political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">He shrank in criticism.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"in 1783, Washington said," "The freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and dumb we are led like sheep to slaughter."</seg>
<seg id="166">"this brings me to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the governor's staff dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a counter-reaction with" Na, "and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's just Facebook," said many people. "</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is particularly important if it is a guy like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a Republican Governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is astonishingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest consent of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very clever in using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to play his haarless head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">"hence the blocking of persons coming to the side of the governor - which is a public forum, which is called officially and by employees paid with public tax dollars - unnecessarily and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the Governor's actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people who vibrate online the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post talked to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"these are just real people speaking with their chosen leaders: a teacher, a businessman and a priest, not trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane."</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other latest news," she wrote in the comment section of the message "The Post." "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I also do not appreciate this idea, if a number of people take a position on the same subject, then they are regarded by some rather as a so-called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the Governor's employees referred to as" "concentrated spam attack" "would probably call" "intercession". ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era simply makes it easy to cut a message by blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is much cleaner than in earlier times, if one would have done the same thing that employees were sent to gather and burn newspapers with critical articles and to arrest demonstrators and to silence them."</seg>
<seg id="191">But exactly that just happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticise Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is accused of Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County rejected the First Amendment, according to US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they banned a voter from their Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">"and in Kentucky, governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU on account of his use of Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="197">That shouldn't be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at the time of Washington, the time of affordable portal had a similar effect as the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers beat on his leadership."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">"people who used pseudonyms like" Juricola, "" Valerius, "" Belisarius "and" Portius "wrote letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions."</seg>
<seg id="202">"petitions, which criticised his position on the amity treaty, trade and shipping with Britain, overpowered his ministry, according to the historical documents collected by the Online Papers of the George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he did not silence them.</seg>
<seg id="204">Freedom of speech and discourses belong to our nation.</seg>
<seg id="205">And true leadership means accepting that.</seg>
<seg id="206">Ronan Rafferty hopes for domestic comfort in Renaissance Club</seg>
<seg id="207">"the former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for home comforts over the next three days, as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open."</seg>
<seg id="208">"the Nordire, who last year joined Archerfield's links to the final round until he lost Paul Eales, is associated with the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CEOs Jerry Sarvadi."</seg>
<seg id="209">"I've seen how the Renaissance club was built, and we see how he achieved his fame with this event," said Rafferty. "</seg>
<seg id="210">"players will see this course from its best side, it is in a great state."</seg>

<seg id="212">He is a keen advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here.</seg>
<seg id="213">This is a great showcase for this course. "</seg>
<seg id="214">"the Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, even though he won the European Tour as well as the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career."</seg>
<seg id="215">"that feels really special," "said the player based in Southport."</seg>
<seg id="216">I have not been able to defend the Extremadura Open since it was taken out of the program in the year after I won it.</seg>
<seg id="217">Coming back to this part of the world is magical.</seg>
<seg id="218">It is a wonderful place to play golf.</seg>
<seg id="219">"the memories from last year come back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win last year here."</seg>
<seg id="220">It was a really special time and one we always appreciated.</seg>
<seg id="221">"Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50th birthday this year, returns to his home ground."</seg>
<seg id="222">This event will be the first Scottish gig ever since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="223">"it always means a little more to play at home," "said Orr, the man of Helensburgh."</seg>
<seg id="224">"you want to do it well, but you also feel that extra pressure."</seg>
<seg id="225">I really enjoyed playing it again and I played a solid golf.</seg>
<seg id="226">I'm happy about the way it went so far.</seg>
<seg id="227">"the trio on the field are the former masters winner Ian Woosnam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNeil."</seg>
<seg id="228">"the former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance is one of the six Scots in the field, the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmutir and Ross Drummond."</seg>
<seg id="229">"admission is free, the car park costs £5 per car with an occupant and £10 per car with two or more passengers."</seg>
<seg id="230">All proceeds go to Prostate Cancer UK.</seg>

<seg id="353">Poverty strengthens the discontent.</seg>
<seg id="354">"the little rice, sold in Enarotali, is too expensive for locals."</seg>
<seg id="355">Bread is just as out of reach.</seg>
<seg id="356">People here build everything they eat: in particular Nota and fruit and leafy vegetables.</seg>
<seg id="357">"agriculture is the task of women, each with four or five fields of sweet potato."</seg>
<seg id="358">Keep the bulk of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market.</seg>
<seg id="359">"ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents)."</seg>
<seg id="360">"over time, economic inequalities between the native Papua and the new migrants have grown, which since the opening of new routes to the hub of Nabire have reached greater numbers."</seg>

<seg id="368">"there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia's most troubled provinces of Papua and West-papua: visa denunciation and a black list," he said in an explanation. "</seg>
<seg id="369">Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to the immediate neighbours of Papuas.</seg>
<seg id="370">"in March six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the" various and widespread violations "in Papua including the Paniai shooting."</seg>
<seg id="371">The same countries have historically been supported by the OPM.</seg>
<seg id="372">"the spokesman of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Arrmanatha Nasir, rejected the group's accusations and said to journalists in Jakarta:" "in Indonesia there is still a democratic system and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence for human rights cases."</seg>

<seg id="374">"when an official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by the Human Rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, Jayapura on May 4 visited, locals broke their silence and urged him" We want freedom, "according to a source that participated in the meeting, but would like to remain anonymous."</seg>
<seg id="375">"Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the people of Papua say that they will probably not vote for Jokovi again."</seg>
<seg id="376">"Jokhang is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shots," says Gobai, the chairman of the tribal Council. "</seg>
<seg id="377">"he wants Jokvai to know that the Paniai people, apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a predatory military, is in poor education and health services."</seg>
<seg id="378">"Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papua, consider their voice to be a" "blame" "that he has to pay back."</seg>
<seg id="379">"they don't need money, they just want justice," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="380">"despite the threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai victims led a last symbolic act of defiance: the body of a victim was buried on a site just opposite the police and the military station."</seg>
<seg id="381">"they know that perhaps justice will never come to them, but at least they will not forget those responsible for their crimes."</seg>

<seg id="423">"in addition to the consistently triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk will first reveal a different, less brilliant number for the first time in announcing the latest quarterly balance sheet: the cancellation of the new mass market model 3."</seg>

<seg id="442">He did not mention the complaint filed against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appeal.</seg>
<seg id="443">"it is about a period that ran for States on October 1, in order to comply with the standards of OOzone in 2015."</seg>
<seg id="444">"in June, Pruitt announced that he would delay adherence over one year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid" interfering with local decisions or hindering economic growth. "</seg>

<seg id="447">The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for the Prup regulatory rollback agenda.</seg>
<seg id="448">"last month, a Federal Court of Appeal in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator exceeded its authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration that committed oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane emissions."</seg>

<seg id="465">Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church</seg>
<seg id="466">"750 years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16, will be invited to a Serenade at 4.30 p.m."</seg>
<seg id="467">"whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historical St. Hilarius facility is a popular place to stay."</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the sixth Benefiz serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and supporters of Tumlingens their concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini stresses: "it is a unique village jewel."</seg>
<seg id="471">"in 1267 St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in documents in the Württembergischer's original customer book: count Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the parish church to Tumlingen, together with the Vogtei" at Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver. "</seg>
<seg id="472">"according to the wording of the document, there was also a beautiful courtyard where the church or the patronage belonged, and not the other way round."</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">"as from the description of the Oberamte Freudenstadt from 1858, there was beside the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the village of Tumlingen, the" mountain "of the third, the dominant settler centre of the village."</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps from the time around the year 1600 confirm this historical situation.</seg>
<seg id="476">The patronage was originated from the early medieval church law.</seg>
<seg id="477">"a gentleman who built a church and occupied himself with a priest remained the owner of this church, and could also inherit this church."</seg>
<seg id="478">The right to appoint a pastor or to propose a new priest to the bishop was related thereto.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The size of the two shredded on Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">"the newly created bell rang for the first time in 1692, but later it had to be handed in during the Second World War in 1942."</seg>
<seg id="482">"during the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648), the window panes were hammered and the belfry were stolen."</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">"in 1796, French troops were camped near the church."</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church threatened to fall in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">"until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler."</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the church of Hilariuskirche was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was left standing.</seg>
<seg id="490">"in the New Year's Eve 1834, a storm split the steeple and half fell."</seg>
<seg id="491">"in order to prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished."</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower still existing today remained as a witness of the 750 year old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">"today, Horst Kallberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem are cultivating the Hilarius facility by Dieter Dockhorn as successor of Dieter Dockhorn."</seg>
<seg id="494">"the organizers invite friends and promoters of Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16, to the sixth serenade on the old cemetery to St. Hilariuskapelle."</seg>
<seg id="495">This is designed by the Combo of the Kepler High School of Freudenstadt and with contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">"Hartmut Romann, the local leader, speaks the closing word."</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is from 15.30.</seg>
<seg id="499">"to conclude the serenade, a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery."</seg>
<seg id="500">"enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to forest," the organisers put out the fantastic views. "</seg>
<seg id="501">The serenade only takes place in dry weather.</seg>
<seg id="502">The organizers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historical St. Hilarius facility that is of importance for Tumlingen and Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="503">Friends and promoters of Tumlingens feel particularly committed to home care such as serenade organizer Walter Martini.</seg>
<seg id="504">Association wants to allow approval of wind turbines</seg>
<seg id="505">"" "Boisheim resists" "sees no legal requirements for the construction and has therefore turned to the Councillor."</seg>
<seg id="506">"the association" "Boisheim forbids" "has prompted Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to take back his permit for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim Nette."</seg>
<seg id="507">It is unlawful.</seg>
<seg id="508">"the association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheim Nette no wind turbines could have been approved, since at that time in Viersen, there was only a wind power concentration zone at the border to Schwalmtal."</seg>
<seg id="509">"within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes an exclusion of wind energy utilization for the rest of the city."</seg>
<seg id="510">Such zones are intended to prevent a "sparing" of the landscape.</seg>
<seg id="511">"the city of Viersen had decided to change a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette a few days earlier, but it did not approve the district government of Düsseldorf, because of a mold failure."</seg>
<seg id="512">"due to the lack of planning law, the granted approval process is still unlawful and therefore also to be taken back," "said Christoph Erkens, chairman of" "Boisheim". ""</seg>
<seg id="513">"current state of affairs: before the summer break, the city council again decided the wind concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette; a permit from the district government still stands."</seg>
<seg id="514">"thus, the granting of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is excluded from planning law."</seg>
<seg id="515">The circle confirms the entrance of the request.</seg>
<seg id="516">"the corresponding writings have been received from the circle of Viersen since last week," "said a spokesman."</seg>
<seg id="517">The circle takes them to examine the matter again.</seg>
<seg id="518">"however, they do not expect the procedure to be stopped."</seg>
<seg id="519">"with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the circle on Thursday did not want to comment on the argumentation of the" "Boisheim" "association."</seg>
<seg id="520">"the NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, is planning to build four, 200-metre-high wind turbines on an area at the Boisheim Nette."</seg>
<seg id="521">"last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen was indirectly involved, had closed lease agreements with the owner of the property of about 65 hectares."</seg>
<seg id="522">"with the construction of the four wind turbines, electricity needs to be covered by some 11 400 households - roughly one fifth of the electricity needs of all four-legged households."</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">"last summer, Viersen gave the green light to purchase three wind turbines at the Linnich wind farm near Aachen, as well as a participation in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in Heinsberg district."</seg>

<seg id="580">"but when a loop around the neck of" Roger "is thrown, almost all of the audience met very real sighs."</seg>
<seg id="581">"since 2005, citizens rights activists go back to Moore's Ford Bridge to imitate the night where two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom, as well as George and Mae Murray Dorsey - have been synched by Ku Klux Klan in 1946."</seg>

<seg id="590">"according to FBI files, which were received by the NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected of the lynching process."</seg>
<seg id="591">But no one has ever been indicted.</seg>
<seg id="592">"although the suspects remain free on foot for decades, citizens say that the double motivation for the Lynch actions throughout the city was always known: politics and sex."</seg>
<seg id="593">"in April 1946, a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice enabled the black citizens to vote their vote in Georgia for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="594">"approximately at the same time as the election stach according to the FBI's black colour gamekeeper Roger Malcom killed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight - allegedly because of a woman."</seg>
<seg id="595">Brooks said that rumours in the city had been that Hester had slept with Malcoms wife Dorothy and that the baby carrying her did not stem from her husband.</seg>
<seg id="596">"on 25 July 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white Landowner, paid 600 dollars to free Malcom from prison, the FBI."</seg>
<seg id="597">He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey to prison.</seg>

<seg id="600">"it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between state and local prosecution, which was not only involved in the killings, evidenced evidence and disguised the identity of witnesses."</seg>
<seg id="601">Brooks makes it even more concise.</seg>

<seg id="606">"it's hard to watch, and even more difficult to look away, but Greene said that this is the point."</seg>
<seg id="607">"we do not want to talk about the lynching because we are confronted with its ugliness in all of us," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="608">But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I've done.</seg>
<seg id="609">"the rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen whites and the rest - crowded into a room and listened as Greene started a well-rehearsed overview of the piece."</seg>

<seg id="611">"he has played the role of Chief Clanmember for many years, but he said that the role will never be easier."</seg>
<seg id="612">"I feel dirty because I'm not so," "said Mardangh."</seg>
<seg id="613">"but I think it is very important to keep this story alive, because we do not want to return to these times."</seg>
<seg id="614">"on the other side of the room, actor Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, rehearsed their lines."</seg>
<seg id="615">"the piece begins with Malcom, the ester cries out and pushes him, furious that he slept with his wife Dorothy."</seg>

<seg id="617">Rascona reciprocates the fire.</seg>
<seg id="618">There is a break.</seg>
<seg id="619">And then everyone breaks (at least all black actors) in laughter.</seg>
<seg id="620">Greene laughs at the loudest.</seg>
<seg id="621">"what?!," said Rascona. "</seg>
<seg id="622">He is alarmed and confused.</seg>

<seg id="629">"everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four killed people."</seg>
<seg id="630">The scene starts again.</seg>
<seg id="631">"this time, when Rasnov says the N-word, he says it sharp and with imprint."</seg>
<seg id="632">Absolutely no one laughs.</seg>
<seg id="633">This repetition ends violently and quickly.</seg>

<seg id="639">"a couple came from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many come down just the street."</seg>
<seg id="640">They have experienced Georgias oppressive moisture for almost eight hours when Brooks takes her on a pilgrimage to the burial sites of Malcoms and Dorseys.</seg>
<seg id="641">"up to this point the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, when you stand on the same country where the Lynch-Morde took place, the air feels ghostly."</seg>
<seg id="642">"when the last notes of the song sound, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the corpse."</seg>
<seg id="643">"children hock at their heads, register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whisper each other."</seg>
<seg id="644">"they are not really dead," "murmurs a little boy as if he wanted to remember."</seg>
<seg id="645">After a few minutes Greene thanked the crowd - and suddenly it's over.</seg>
<seg id="646">The actors throw away the lynching rope and wipe off their tears.</seg>

<seg id="655">"it's hard to hear these terrible words and deeds... coming from people who look like you and they do that, because they look like you," "she said."</seg>
<seg id="656">"what this really does with me makes me believe that the lynching still goes on," she added, "today it is called police shootings."</seg>
<seg id="657">"in the same room, Tyrone Brooks is holding yard at his table, eating and remembering civil rights."</seg>
<seg id="658">He said he started planning the performance next year.</seg>
<seg id="659">"the post is inspiring in a way because it describes the horror of what we endured, but it is also a moment of learning," he said. "</seg>

<seg id="862">"with the first season of the season, Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the result, too, wouldn't be the two opponents at 2: 2 against Brunswick."</seg>
<seg id="863">"these were two opponents too much, and we have to watch out even better in Aue," says the defenders of Fortuna Düsseldorf. "</seg>
<seg id="864">"in the Ore Mountains, the three-chain is to be further optimized."</seg>
<seg id="865">And the Fortunas don't want to catch a gate after an offensive.</seg>
<seg id="866">"for the future, it will be so that no one stands next to Michael (Rensing)."</seg>
<seg id="867">Hoffmann is convinced that after the experience in preparation with the three chain his team is better able to cope better than with the four chain.</seg>
<seg id="868">"I don't know how we will act in Aue," says his trainer Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is convinced of his cause, "because we have just been in the three chain on the half positions in Kaan Ayaan and Niko Gießelmann players who can build up well," Hoffmann said. "</seg>
<seg id="869">"the prerequisite is, however, that we are still better harmonizing and we don't afford such a lot of playing mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="870">"of course, Hoffmann goes to Aue to win the game."</seg>
<seg id="871">"but whether you can talk about a failed start, you don't know."</seg>

<seg id="876">"now they can start the season virtually with a home game," "said Funkel and Hoffmann, that the players from Aue might even be a bit fresher, as they wouldn't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a promotion favorite in the bones."</seg>
<seg id="877">"but they don't know so 100% where they are at the moment," says the defenders of Fortuna. "</seg>
<seg id="878">Although the guests from the Rhineland go as a light favorite on Sunday in the encounter at last (almost) finished stadium of Aue.</seg>
<seg id="879">"that we sweep it away, just because we are entitled to come under the first six, is nonsense," says Funkel, whose balance is quite positive with only a defeat against Aue from nine games. "</seg>

<seg id="884">Recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden who have undergone a new method for medical evaluation of their age show that more than 80 percent of the tested individuals are older than 18 years. but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.</seg>
<seg id="885">The Swedish authorities for Forensic Medicine (medicamentals medicinalisation) began the tests last year.</seg>
<seg id="886">"during the asylum process, they should make the assessment of age more precise after the Swedish Migration Service (Migrationsverket) criticised for the assessment of the correct age of some refugees who were minor."</seg>
<seg id="887">"until today, migration sales have sent 6,880 to test cases and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017."</seg>
<seg id="888">Eighty percent (2002) were evaluated as 18 or older while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person was "possibly 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="889">In 432 cases the conclusion was that the person was "possibly under 18 years old."</seg>
<seg id="890">The tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.</seg>
<seg id="891">"according to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are consistent over the past few months."</seg>
<seg id="892">"we don't see a big difference in the statistics of the past months, the numbers are fairly constant," he said to the magazine The Local. "</seg>
<seg id="893">The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged more than 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seekers have lied about his age.</seg>
<seg id="894">"in May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there are 442 cases suggesting that the subordinated person is 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="895">"when the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, it noted that in 243 of these cases the person had said openly that it will be 18 years old this year."</seg>
<seg id="896">"the method of medical age assessment, during which x-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints are made, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, was also criticized in some areas."</seg>
<seg id="897">A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute whose work involves assessing the biological maturity of humans to see if they were earlier or later than usual by puberty.</seg>
<seg id="898">I had reason to think about it and I don't think that the type of measurement should be used.</seg>
<seg id="899">Judging the biological age in this way is very uncertain.</seg>
<seg id="900">"if we can't say it safe, we should not do as if we could," he said the newspaper Metro. "</seg>
<seg id="901">"Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, however, defended the accuracy of the tests:" in general, you can say that the risk of being incorrectly assessing a child as an adult is low. "</seg>
<seg id="902">"the greatest risk is when the person is just under 18, in this case this is about 10 percent."</seg>
<seg id="903">Fully in the plan</seg>
<seg id="904">The works on the three bridges of the road 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg are progressing well.</seg>

<seg id="906">"we are very good at the time, it's going great," says Reinhold Leicht, head of construction at the Department of Road Engineering and Transport in the Presidency of Freiburg. "</seg>
<seg id="907">"in April, the work began at the same time on all three need for rehabilitation between Schramberg and Lauterbach."</seg>
<seg id="908">The end of the building is scheduled for October and Leicht is sure that the schedule is respected.</seg>
<seg id="909">"the first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach."</seg>
<seg id="910">"it is an arch bridge made of concrete, which is covered with red Buntsandstein and has a total length of 4.80 metres."</seg>
<seg id="911">It was built in 1900.</seg>
<seg id="912">"like the two other bridges, too, it has now come into the years."</seg>
<seg id="913">"in order to ensure stability and road safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated."</seg>
<seg id="914">The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="915">They are made of red Buntsandstein.</seg>
<seg id="916">"both were built in 1939 and are twelve, respectively 10.60 meters long."</seg>
<seg id="917">The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach on Wednesday morning on the north side had a 1.30m wide and seven tons weight so-called bridge cap.</seg>
<seg id="918">This is a border fixing that is also used as an operating path.</seg>
<seg id="919">At the southern part of the bridge a 2.20 meter wide bridge should be used on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="920">Then the pedestrian path is to run.</seg>
<seg id="921">"the special thing is that they are finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger Company Dizwo."</seg>
<seg id="922">The other two bridges have already been fitted with the patented bridge caps.</seg>
<seg id="923">Special fingertip sensitivity has demanded the laying of cables through the building in Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="924">Because there is also a fibre-optic cable to which many companies are connected.</seg>
<seg id="925">The residents were informed in advance of the work by handbooks on the project.</seg>

<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unimpeded expenses of European football clubs will not interfere with Neymars world record transfers from Spain to the French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"any consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain from the UEFA, as the leading organization that monitors the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament."</seg>
<seg id="1124">"financial Fair Play rules, launched in 2011 by the UEFA, mean that PSG has to prove at some point that Neymar's transfer was financed without major losses."</seg>
<seg id="1125">"Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to buy the Brazilians from their contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year."</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">"PSG can safely make the money loose, so that Neymar will sign and bring him to a galaxy of other stars, in view of the funding of the team by the energy-rich host family of Qatar."</seg>
<seg id="1128">"clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money for the purchase of players, but they have to counteract them with legitimate income sources enabling them to break even point in their football related business."</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"the former French player believed that associations, who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success, effectively cheat and risked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support."</seg>
<seg id="1131">"in 2011, FFP shifted from concentration on the debts of the clubs to monitor their losses."</seg>
<seg id="1132">"the change meant that the business model, the Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to build the team and build a global brand - to become a harder matter."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"during the current three-year FFP expansion period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses amounting to 30 million euros."</seg>
<seg id="1134">"and although Platini has fallen away from the Presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to be deterred by excessive expenses."</seg>
<seg id="1135">"certainly FFP isn't dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press last week. "</seg>
<seg id="1136">"although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a lump sum, it can distribute the amount for accounting for the duration of its contract."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the revenues for the next five years can be reported in the annual financial statements for the next five years."</seg>
<seg id="1138">"the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has hit the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"PSG received a fine of €60 million ($82 million), which was later lowered to €20 million - and it was ordered that the team members for the 2014 / 15 Champions League will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players."</seg>
<seg id="1140">UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their revenues by companies associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">"while a Catalan company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not be regarded as legitimate income."</seg>
<seg id="1142">This was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of the PSA sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that some of the PSG payments to Neymar could come about payments from the Organizing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar have argued that Neymar WM will be ambassadors and one such maneuver could be easy to find out for the UEFA regulatory authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1145">"the previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive, to observe any attempt to circumvent the rules."</seg>
<seg id="1146">"the UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG via Neymars Transfer, said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation."</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press because they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The last published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of €542.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="1149">The accounts for the last fiscal year must still be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">"PSG expects Neymars's arrival to be a blessing for sponsoring deals, merchandising and jersey sales."</seg>

<seg id="1158">Swiss is looking for a new shock supplier</seg>
<seg id="1159">In recent years Chocolat Frey has made board chocolate for Swiss.</seg>
<seg id="1160">Now the sweet collaboration is coming to an end: the airline is rewriting the order.</seg>
<seg id="1161">"on request of the news agency, Swiss-Speaker Meike Fuhlrott confirmed a corresponding report from the newspaper" Nordwestschweiz "on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="1162">"according to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018."</seg>
<seg id="1163">The products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control.</seg>

<seg id="1184">"this repetition of history is at the same time nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80s, for the 90-years-grunge period (when the pioneers David Wain and Michael Showalter play the Sketch-comedy" The State "for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001 before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went to bigger things."</seg>
<seg id="1185">"as a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era. permanent memories."</seg>
<seg id="1186">But as a franchise it feels like time would be scarce.</seg>
<seg id="1187">"first Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of its absurd humour (it contained an original story for an appealing can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin). "</seg>
<seg id="1188">"by venturing onto the core of the gags - middle-aged actors play horny kids, who will grow up - nevertheless they created the impossibility to win back the last part of the teat."</seg>

<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost his virginity.</seg>

<seg id="1196">"it's a lot of fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillons sideburns of" Singles, "whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old boy."</seg>
<seg id="1197">"these are the moments of chance madness that could heat this franchise as a kind of repetitive" Seven Up!

<seg id="1198">"Comrade Detective" on Amazon is now reminiscent of another kind of nostalgia: to revive the Cold War from "The Americans," to the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its East-to-West wrestling iconography. "</seg>

<seg id="1205">But "Comrade Detective" is so much involved in the truthfulness of a dubious propaganda-drama - a murderer carrying a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single one.</seg>
<seg id="1206">"there are six long episodes, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough."</seg>
<seg id="1207">"Comrade Detective, who was reduced to a lesser length, could deliver his agitprop satire better, since Gregory and Iosef always visit the American embassy whose lobby is always occupied by two big men who devour a bunch of hamburgers."</seg>

<seg id="1211">The police succeeded in beating the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.</seg>

<seg id="1214">"in addition, the officials ensured large amounts of marijuana and cocaine, firearms as well as several hundred thousand euros."</seg>
<seg id="1215">Two people were arrested at the same time in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="1216">There were German arrest warrants against the two suspects.</seg>
<seg id="1217">"therefore, the two are probably extradited to Germany."</seg>
<seg id="1218">Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.</seg>
<seg id="1219">A total of more than 300 police officers were in use.</seg>
<seg id="1220">"organised drug criminality, severe acts of violence, attempted murder as well as robbery and blackmail were charged to members of the Mafia."</seg>
<seg id="1221">"since summer 2016, the public prosecutor's office has been investigating the organised drug trafficking in Southern Germany."</seg>
<seg id="1222">"between the public prosecutions in Constance and Palermo, there was a lively exchange and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily."</seg>
<seg id="1223">"therefore, the large-scale use on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo."</seg>

<seg id="1229">"according to a media report, the Commissioner for Refugee Management of the Federal Government, Frank-Jürgen Weise, drew attention to large gaps in the country's central register."</seg>
<seg id="1230">"deficiencies in the data recorded there could lead to some serious misdecisions in case of asylum procedures and deportations, warned in an analysis of the" Süddeutsche Zeitung. ""</seg>
<seg id="1231">"according to the statistics, ten million people with foreign nationality are registered in the Register, including 5.7 million people from non-EU countries."</seg>
<seg id="1232">The data is therefore administered by approximately 600 country authorities in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1233">"because the data has not been sufficiently maintained, the data quality in parts has not been good so far."</seg>
<seg id="1234">"in individual cases, data was found in 1921," "by people who are no longer alive, or citizens who have become German citizens and should not appear in the Register any more."</seg>
<seg id="1235">"faulty data inputs can significantly slow return processes," "says the report."</seg>
<seg id="1236">"moreover, in statistics on sufficient people, EU citizens are also included who do not have to travel at all."</seg>
<seg id="1237">"such false ordinances led to a distorted debate on how to deal with outgoing taxpayers," says the analysis. "</seg>
<seg id="1238">"meanwhile, the Federal Government obviously started sending refugee families back to Italy with under 16-year-old children when they arrived from there."</seg>
<seg id="1239">"this is due to an internal paper from the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the" Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung. ""</seg>

<seg id="1262">The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%</seg>
<seg id="1263">The Bank of England will probably later announce that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weakening of inflation have dampened speculation over an increase.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain sluggish when it retained interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensified pressure.</seg>
<seg id="1265">"the political decision-makers of the Monetary Committee (MPC) agreed with 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.25%, with fewer members striving to increase interest rates this month because weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase."</seg>
<seg id="1266">"in its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6% and warned that the pressure on domestic income would continue, with inflation expected to rise to just under 3% in the fall."</seg>
<seg id="1267">"but she signaled that in the next few years interest increases would be necessary to raise the inflation imposed by Brexit, and she said that borrowing costs might have to rise more than expected in the financial markets."</seg>
<seg id="1268">Members also voted to withdraw part of the Mammoth economic stimulus package which was issued one year after the Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="1269">"it will require time for the finance plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks from the next February, although it has been said that it will now be expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling."</seg>
<seg id="1270">"the Bank said:" "in the central prognosis of the MPC the gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak at short notice, as the pressure on the real income of households continues to burden consumption."</seg>
<seg id="1271">"in the interest rates, it was repeated that" a certain tightening of monetary policy "would be required to cool inflation and a" slightly larger "scale than the markets expect."</seg>
<seg id="1272">The markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="1273">"however, the Bank emphasized that increases would be" "progressively" "and" "limited". ""</seg>
<seg id="1274">The Bank's growth forecasts for this and next year are expected to rise by 1.9% and 1.7% in May.</seg>
<seg id="1275">It has retained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1276">The pound fell according to these news against the dollar and the euro.</seg>
<seg id="1277">The pound fell by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and fell by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.</seg>
<seg id="1278">The decision to no change comes after the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened the rising expectations for an increase in interest and the GDP in the second quarter increased from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3%.</seg>
<seg id="1279">"growth will likely be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will recover slightly after the end of the year."</seg>
<seg id="1280">"the recent inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households, which are affected by rising inflation and low rise elevations, as the tightening becomes even worse before it becomes better."</seg>
<seg id="1281">"she added that in the coming years monetary policy cannot" "prevent the income from coming", "but she added that salaries will recover significantly at the end of their three-year forecast."</seg>
<seg id="1282">"the economy is also boosted by rising demand for British goods, which is due to the weak pounds, which is offset by a proportion of lower consumption expenditure."</seg>
<seg id="1283">"the decision comes a year after lowering the interest rates to 0.25% last August following the shocking EU vote, which caused the sinking of the findings."</seg>
<seg id="1284">The bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will completely reach the prices and the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1285">"before the Bank's last judgement on interest rates, the call for interest rates increased because inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers calling for an increase to 0.5% in July."</seg>
<seg id="1286">"inflation decreased from 2.9% in June to 2.6% in June, although the Bank said this was expected and will attract it again in the coming months."</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Bank said that exceeding the ratio to its target of 2% was "quite" attributable to the weak pound.</seg>
<seg id="1288">"Andrew Montlake, Director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said:" in view of the recent downfall of Swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to be more competitive again, as the lenders are looking loudly for business and want to end the year in a positive way. "</seg>

<seg id="1290">"NHS (National Health Service) urged to prescribe 10,000 people to controversial HIV drug"</seg>
<seg id="1291">Patients will receive access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment in September following a fight before the High Court.</seg>
<seg id="1292">"NHS England announced that prior to sexual intercourse, pre-positioning prophylaxis (prep), which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now provided by health service via a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"he agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appeal confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court last year, according to which the NHS had the authority to pay for the prep despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"announced on Thursday, NHS England chief Simon Stevens was welcomed as an" important new intervention, "while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) described this as" decisive moment. ""</seg>
<seg id="1295">"sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to enable the application of people and other clinics will follow in October 2018 before it will be introduced all over England in April 2018."</seg>
<seg id="1296">Pre- position prophylaxis (prep) is a series of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Studies have shown that prep significantly reduces HIV transmission in infectious diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Taking prep prior to intercourse means that just enough medications are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Such drugs can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse.</seg>
<seg id="1300">"those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and individuals with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated."</seg>
<seg id="1301">"clinics will identify suitable participants who agree to the study including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment."</seg>
<seg id="1302">People who live in England and registered with a family doctor can also register for possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.</seg>
<seg id="1303">The program is signed £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week after an international competitive procurement.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"the study aims to assess the entire potential of prep by collecting clinical evidence, which is targeted, recorded and implemented on a large scale."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Stevens said: "this great new intervention should supplement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in coping with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity. "</seg>
<seg id="1307">"Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National AIDS Trust) said:" "this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV."</seg>
<seg id="1308">"prep, aimed at targeting needy and vulnerable people, provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic."</seg>
<seg id="1309">"from September onwards, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives."</seg>
<seg id="1310">We warmly welcome this announcement. "</seg>
<seg id="1311">"Ian Green, Chief Executive Officer of the Terrence Higgins Trust said:" "the priority now has to be for the study to be carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind."</seg>
<seg id="1312">"now that prep test medicine was procured, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"Sharon Hodgson, Shadow Health Minister, said:" "the beginning of the prep process is welcome and overdue after months of delay and delayed implementation by the government."</seg>
<seg id="1314">The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and to end the transmission of this life-changing infection.</seg>
<seg id="1315">This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of prep.</seg>
<seg id="1316">"now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible across the country to protect people who are HIV-infected, and that it will help us to take a step closer to the end of the spread of HIV in society."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Living the big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks turned this little Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Joanne Leigh, a former merchant with a passion for real estate, reduced 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to Earls Court Apartment."</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it's a proof of the new design that Joanne hasn't packed and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," Joanne says. "</seg>
<seg id="1321">I was looking for something comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">I fell in love with her and made an offer this day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-bedroom property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine for optimal use of the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"that was my request," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1328">"for this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12,5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms on top of each other, so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating a mezzanine where one could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel plant is quite complicated," he explains. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked on top of each other, without having to bend down."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not only about building a simple platform, but to attach the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below."</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms in full height - with much additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">"for the mezzanine, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Moulin illumination set the style for the program."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"at both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to let it work longer."</seg>
<seg id="1339">"in the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window into another room."</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance there are mirrored units for all the cutlery and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">"through the perception of a glamorous room, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Folding kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering went in," Erfan explains from the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door. "</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is opposite, so that when you push the door, it glides very easily."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day, you will sell the land - or how your property is estimated," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on the ground size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"here they have managed to enlarge the floor space, and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things that touch you, and therefore help to create an emotional bond within a home," "says Erfan."</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you do not fall in love with electrical outlets in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">"these are important, but they do not play with your heart."</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square metre of something by default into something quite amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">"in fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave them."</seg>

<seg id="1358">"Paul wanted to retire from family business since 2014, but a sharp debate about separation takes place in the Supreme Court."</seg>
<seg id="1359">"together with her mother Anna, the Brothers possess 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the 1973 family bought a shop in Smith Street, Collingwood."</seg>
<seg id="1360">"there, the Westco family founded jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores."</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1362">"this money was invested in real estate, and De Lutis portfolio now includes offices in the city center, Brunswick and Sorrento's development areas, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt. Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburbs."</seg>
<seg id="1363">"following an agreement with her late father, Colin - by Paul described as" main operator and the dominant personality "in the De Lutis family - about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul a third."</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court file states that this means that Colin's ownership has a value of $316 million and Paul in value of $176 million.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of real estate and cash has turned out to be a problem for Paul.</seg>

<seg id="1388">New Chief of Staff Trump plans to limit the president's media abstinence.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">"if so, he will be the first."</seg>
<seg id="1392">"Politico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including the reports of the news media - hoping to keep the boss on a more even course."</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with senior executives at his first working day, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House which he wanted to repair: bad information falling into the president's hands."</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly said the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would get good information.</seg>
<seg id="1396">"Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring its media diet."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"President Trump's relationship with television reaches decades back - and now, where he is in the White House, his TV advertising is still strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"when candidate Trump was annoyed for unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of jobs that were to be persuaded," "said the former election campaign officer Sam Nunberg in February against Politico."</seg>
<seg id="1399">"Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" "the key to keeping Trump Twitter habit under control, according to six former electoral campaigners, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady lobbying price."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that trumps Twitter habit ever was "under control" is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don't know others - that trumps Tweets without their interventions would have included even more combustibles.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">"if his staff already managed to keep his anger away from him, their efforts paid off."</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently prevented Trump controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">"part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that could potentially promote their views of the world."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"politico - busy with this story, reported in May about the preference of advisers to provide dubious information to the president for strategic reasons."</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump officials say that Trump is able to react like a volcano to negative press clippings, especially those with damaged leaks, and that he insists on finding out whence they come from."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"this was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone maliciously issued a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh," to be the source behind a heap of leaks "in the White House."</seg>
<seg id="1411">"although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for shkanen or that he has not offered concrete evidence, or that he has expressed false allegations in the past, and has revoked them."</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and started asking people about Walsh.</seg>
<seg id="1413">"Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork and to document the Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work out?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly is trying three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">"perhaps he will prove himself as more effective manager than priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors still seek influence."</seg>
<seg id="1417">These immutable factors make Kellys Mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1431">The tactful group found a gap in the defensive facilities and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way.</seg>
<seg id="1432">"furious people have urged the Council of Solihull, saying that it is useless to deal with the problem."</seg>
<seg id="1433">An anonymous inhabitant said: "they moved there on Monday night after they were sent on by Bentley Heath where they threw stones onto the passers-by.</seg>
<seg id="1434">"the Council must act in action by means of shame, as it was useless when dealing with the problem."</seg>

<seg id="1444">From Birkenhof to the Waldhotel Luise</seg>
<seg id="1445">The Waldhotel Luise is from the former Hotel Birkenhof.</seg>
<seg id="1446">"the house in front of the gates of Freudenstadts is currently being renovated and is to be reopened on March 1, next year."</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">"due to the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof due to the former ambience of the company company ltd. to 13 April 2014, approximately 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost and income from the local tax was also lost."</seg>
<seg id="1449">"in the fall of 2014, in view of the dramatically increasing numbers of refugees coming to the county, the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation, which provided controversial discussions."</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a construction plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">"at that time, the decision was not undisputed in the Municipal Council."</seg>
<seg id="1452">"however, Freudenstadts Mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties at the house."</seg>
<seg id="1453">He was to be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group Luisenhotels with director Birgit Scherer in Bad Bergzabern has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a home of the three-star-plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.</seg>
<seg id="1457">"you are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise."</seg>
<seg id="1458">"at the former Hotel Birkenhof already since a long time Baushuttles have been standing in front of the entrance, and when entering the house it becomes clear what extensive renovations are carried out."</seg>
<seg id="1459">"the floors were pulled out, ceilings were broken down, old bathtubs removed from the rooms."</seg>
<seg id="1460">The entire hotel building is a single building site.</seg>
<seg id="1461">There is still much to do until March.</seg>
<seg id="1462">"it is actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper. "</seg>
<seg id="1463">Everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style.</seg>
<seg id="1464">"the rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed."</seg>
<seg id="1465">"everything should later become" "beautiful citizen-close", "as Thomas Scherer is expressing."</seg>
<seg id="1466">"we want to make a piece of jewellery out of it." ""</seg>
<seg id="1467">"swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room belong to the equipment."</seg>
<seg id="1468">"one does not want to position itself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbath, but already on an upscale downtown level, shearers."</seg>
<seg id="1469">"the Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms would like to set up wide, explains shavers."</seg>
<seg id="1470">"individual vacationers, groups or businessmen should feel comfortable in the hotel."</seg>
<seg id="1471">"talking with OB Julian Osswald and director of tourism Michael Krause, he already led, so shaver."</seg>
<seg id="1472">The ideas of the city are identical to those of the hotel group.</seg>
<seg id="1473">"we are on the same line."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"according to the amount of investments, Thomas Scherer doesn't want to define himself exactly."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"just under one million euros, he reckons."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"the external systems are also brought onto the front man, which is already clearly visible."</seg>
<seg id="1477">"in the courtyard there is a large terrace, which is accessible from the restaurant, which is public."</seg>
<seg id="1478">Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market."</seg>
<seg id="1479">Russia affair: U.S. Special Investigator sets out Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">"in the Russia affair surrounding U.S. President Donald Trump, special promoters Robert Mueller is said to have appointed a so-called Grand Jury after a report."</seg>
<seg id="1481">"in recent weeks, the committee accepted the work, wrote the Wall Street Journal on appeal to people familiar with the matter."</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper regarded the step as a sign that Mueller had extended and intensified his investigations.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"the CNN channel reported, there are already first invitations issued by the committee in connection with a meeting between the slinging of oldest son and a Russian lawyer."</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence agencies have been accusing the Kremlin for a long time to intervene in the presidential election campaign in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examined whether there were agreements between the sling campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"in the focus of the investigation, several men are to stand, who acted as advisers to the Republicans in the election campaign."</seg>
<seg id="1487">"according to reports, Mueller also magnified more and more pumps in private and business environments."</seg>
<seg id="1488">"a few weeks ago, the" Washington Post "wrote that the special agent Trump personally moved to the centre and searched for the accusation whether the President might have obstructed the judiciary in the course of the affair."</seg>
<seg id="1489">Grand Jury's main task is to examine present evidence in possible crime cases and to decide whether charges are to be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">"therefore, Grand Jurys are also called the defendants."</seg>
<seg id="1491">"most of the time, they are turned on when it concerns larger and controversial cases."</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The Panel can also be switched on by the public prosecutor to charge individuals under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"according to CNN, invitations have already been issued, which revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer."</seg>
<seg id="1495">People who were involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement called it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">"in addition, they should provide documents."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"in addition to Trump Jr., also Trump consultants and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his brother-in-law Paul Manafort were talking to the conversation."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the assumption that Mueller would not be intimidated in his work, and that if necessary, he wanted to act quickly."</seg>
<seg id="1499">"however, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on to decide on the rise of an indictment."</seg>
<seg id="1500">"nevertheless, the substitution of the Gremium was the beginning of a new phase in investigations and a new cause for concern for President Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1501">"in the midst of the new revelations, the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to present the Russia affair as a campaign against its political opponents."</seg>
<seg id="1502">"the Russian history is a total invention," "said Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1503">The theme gives the Democrats an opportunity to "feel good" because they have nothing else to talk about.</seg>
<seg id="1504">"his special advisor, Ty Cobb, stated in a statement that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury."</seg>
<seg id="1505">"he also usually works in secret, he emphasised."</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House is in favour of any measures that accelerated the work of the special agent in a "fair" way.</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI chief James Comey said three times that not against the president.</seg>
<seg id="1508">"there is no reason to assume that something has changed, it was said in the Declaration."</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller had only been used after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"because of this outrage, accusations against Trump had become loud, he had to hinder the judiciary."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"Comey said in June of a Senate Committee, Trump asked him to set up the investigation against the former National Security Advisor, Michael Flynn."</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"following the presentation of US media, the White House collected material against the Special Agent and its employees."</seg>
<seg id="1514">This triggered speculation as to whether Trump Mueller released.</seg>
<seg id="1515">"unlike an independent investigator of the Congress, like in the Watergate affair, about the later retired President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired on urging the President of the Ministry of Justice."</seg>
<seg id="1516">But several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"two groups of republican and democratic senators presented legislation on Thursday, after which the Special Issuer could no longer be dismissed."</seg>
<seg id="1518">Antarctica: gigantic iceberg drives in Antarctica</seg>
<seg id="1519">"in the Western Antarctic, a gigantic iceberg of the almost seven-fold size of Berlin from Schelfeis solved itself."</seg>
<seg id="1520">The Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday announced this.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"the large colossus carried over a trillion tons and 5800 square kilometres will now drive north and will probably need two, three years until it has melted."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"with 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered over the past three decades."</seg>
<seg id="1523">A danger for people does not go out of him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">The extent to which climate change has played a role in the demolition of the iceberg is unclear according to research data.</seg>
<seg id="1525">"in total, however, there have been a series of unusual breakthroughs in the region for about 30 years, writes the US research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a facsimile background."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"according to many researchers, this can be related to global warming."</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken colossus has so far been a part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeira lies south of South America almost at the head of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this horseshoe was disturbed by the balance of waxing and abrupt a few years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">AWI researcher Daniela Jansen writes about a complete shelf.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"there is a lot to say about the fact that the Larsen-C-Schelseshos is in danger, because the front edge has never been pulled back as far as it is currently."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"in addition, the ice plate stands under tension and can disintegrate if a piece breaks down at a key point."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Melting Schelsess and Eisberg do not increase sea level as they float on the water and ice cream as much water as it does after the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">"however, the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"this could increase the level of sea level, but only to a small extent, the British research project investigates Antarctica (Midas)."</seg>
<seg id="1538">"according to AWI, the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth largest shelf in Antarctica with almost 50 000 square kilometres."</seg>
<seg id="1539">"at the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean approximately 200 meters."</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural occurrence and is not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice sheet is now in a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary of the British Swansea University. "</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records," he also affirmed. "</seg>
<seg id="1543">"scientists have argued whether the Larsen-C-Schelfeira will grow again or fall back in the long term and possibly fall together," said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"even if these researchers do not return to climate change, these gigantic iceberg glaciers have fallen away in the Antarctic Peninsula in recent decades."</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirt of the Antarctic stretches in the direction of South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">"according to the British Antarctic Survey research program, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s."</seg>
<seg id="1548">The increase in temperature has contributed to this decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">"in the last 50 years, the Antarctic Peninsula has been warming up by about three degrees, counting thus to the areas where the temperature is fastest."</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants house tariff at the staff</seg>
<seg id="1551">"because it becomes increasingly difficult to fill vacant positions, the CDU demands to step out of the employers' association to become more attractive."</seg>
<seg id="1552">"just before the summer break, the District Day marked 41 new positions in the administration."</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Now 17 trainees have their first working day behind.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The apprenticeships in the circle are obviously very sought-after.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Around 620 applications were available for the places to be allocated this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">"nevertheless, the circle continues to lack staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks."</seg>
<seg id="1558">"at present, there are still 50 vacancies at the Mettmann district."</seg>
<seg id="1559">"among other things, doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration are sought."</seg>
<seg id="1560">"together with the FDP and the UWG, the CDU wants to take the initiative and counter the shortage of skilled workers in the administration."</seg>
<seg id="1561">"after the parties" wish, the administration will work out a concept for recruitment and personnel development. "</seg>
<seg id="1562">"the aim is to meet not only short-term requirements for skilled workers, but to counteract the future-oriented candidate shortage."</seg>
<seg id="1563">"the overall concept should be oriented internally and externally, to show concrete measures for cross-starters and involve a training offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG."</seg>
<seg id="1564">This sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn't know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">The speech is of a regular "competition of public employers."</seg>
<seg id="1568">"in addition, a high number of employees who retire from service due to illness or age."</seg>
<seg id="1569">"so it's high time for action, so that no more jobs will remain unoccupied."</seg>
<seg id="1570">"but Klaus-Dieter Völker, leader of the CDU, goes beyond the common application with his party."</seg>
<seg id="1571">"he took a long time already in the District Day for a foul-sized surprise, when he publicly questioned the personnel expenses and baffled the rest of the parties."</seg>
<seg id="1572">People want all possibilities to be checked to allow an exit from the communal employers' association.</seg>
<seg id="1573">"if we do not come to a satisfying solution at short notice, the county government should aim with the trade unions - perhaps in co-operation with the county-affiliated towns - a house tariff," states peoples. "</seg>
<seg id="1574">"in this way, the CDU tries to pay better the employees and officials than the public service plan envisages."</seg>
<seg id="1575">"the salaries currently are exactly prescribed, increases or more money are only available if you move to a higher level that is oriented to professional years."</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle have grown steadily over the past few years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">"only a few weeks ago, new premises had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Prostitution Act."</seg>
<seg id="1578">"not least due to the increasing number of asylum seekers, Councillor Thomas Hendele and Kreisdirektor Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little staff."</seg>
<seg id="1579">Italy tightens the tone on NGO migrants' rescue boats</seg>
<seg id="1580">"Italy has warned NGOs that use lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean, warned that they cannot continue this if they do not adhere to new rules for their operations."</seg>
<seg id="1581">"if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue working," said Minister of Interior, Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa. "</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minnitis warning came one day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German relief organisation 'Youth Rettet' because their team effectively collaborated with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">"the relief organisation, which was in operation only for one year, refused to comment on detailed allegations of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio."</seg>
<seg id="1584">"for us, saving human life remains our top priority. so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," "said the organization in a statement on the social media."</seg>
<seg id="1585">We can only judge all accusations that are currently collected after we have collected all the information and assess the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1586">"the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of 'Youth Rettet', the Iuventa, since October."</seg>
<seg id="1587">"it is suspected that its crew is aboard dinghy migrants, which are delivered directly by human traffickers, and that smugglers can depart so that the ships can be used again."</seg>
<seg id="1588">"at least one such meeting was said to be only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the Act of the Prosecutor, whose contents were published by Italian media."</seg>
<seg id="1589">"the occupation is suspected to override the authority of the Italian Coastguard, which monitors rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives."</seg>
<seg id="1590">"under the Code of Conduct, boats like Iuventa must first have an Italian police inspector who monitors their activities."</seg>
<seg id="1591">"only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue missions have agreed to keep the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain."</seg>
<seg id="1592">"the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable, as they would not bring any" significant changes or disabilities "of their rescue operations."</seg>
<seg id="1593">"among those who refuse to sign, Nobel prize laureate organisation Doctors Without Borders (MSF)."</seg>
<seg id="1594">"meanwhile, Minniti said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures had declined in recent weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen Libyan coastguards and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit."</seg>
<seg id="1595">"in the last days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," "said the minister."</seg>
<seg id="1596">"he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month about economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants that leave these countries in the hope of reaching Europe."</seg>
<seg id="1597">Ascents and Trials</seg>
<seg id="1598">"nine Weilermer Bikers, the" Berlin Outpost "and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the Nordpfalz region for four days to enjoy trials and sightseeings."</seg>
<seg id="1599">Three friendly guides were available for this.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The Burgundy and Weinfest of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour led by hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="1603">"there were viewpoints, partly on towers, from which one could look far above the Palatinate forest and the upstream planes."</seg>
<seg id="1604">"in between there were always longer climbs, for the long trials rewarded."</seg>
<seg id="1605">"on the second day, we went to Bad Dürkheim to Saline and to the folk festival of Wurstmarkt."</seg>
<seg id="1606">"again, there was a lookout spot on the lookout spot, connected by" flounge "Trials and moderate ascents."</seg>
<seg id="1607">On the last two days a lot of altimeters were announced.</seg>
<seg id="1608">"caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and refuges brought welcome breaks."</seg>
<seg id="1609">"in Bad Dürkheim, the bikers chatted healing brine in the open-air inhalatorium."</seg>
<seg id="1610">Also Neustadt was also controlled.</seg>
<seg id="1611">"after 173 kilometres and almost 4500 meters of altitude, the group met the Palatinate Forest from its best side - sporty and culturally - met."</seg>
<seg id="1612">Console instead of lawns - Bundesliga is equipping itself for e-sport</seg>
<seg id="1613">"in future, sports stars are sitting in front of computer consoles, instead of being sweaty in wind and weather over the stadium rascals?"</seg>
<seg id="1614">"fact is: e-sport has long been a serious business, become a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gauges included."</seg>
<seg id="1615">"this also recognised the first federal government associations, who are increasingly involved in this field."</seg>
<seg id="1616">"the beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, followed by FC Schalke 04 and finally the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sports department in mid-July and took two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game."</seg>
<seg id="1617">"we hope to inspire completely new young target groups for the VfB," says CEO Jochen Röttgermann. "</seg>
<seg id="1618">It is certain that a number of clubs still climb this turn.</seg>
<seg id="1619">"next weekend, FIFA World Cup Football Association organized the first Interactive Club World Cup in London, where the gamers of various clubs compete against each other."</seg>
<seg id="1620">"in addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven have qualified."</seg>
<seg id="1621">Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports.</seg>
<seg id="1622">The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen has meanwhile advised an agency for virtual football players.</seg>
<seg id="1623">"real football has to deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds, that young people will go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old. "</seg>
<seg id="1624">"and: the clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets, especially the Asian ones."</seg>
<seg id="1625">"with prominent E-athletes under contract, you could be far more likely to be present on these markets online than once a year, to send the Bundesliga to Asia."</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it all about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">"computer games such as" League Of Legends, "" Dota 2, "" Counterstrike "or the football simulation of FIFA will be challenged at the competition level."</seg>
<seg id="1628">"as in normal sports, leagues have long since established themselves, in which professionals compete against each other."</seg>
<seg id="1629">"and in the 2022 World Cup, e-sport is already part of the official program."</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it really a sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">"for many, the idea is certainly getting used."</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobming also dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">"for Professor at the Deutsche Sporthochschule in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical reactions that can be found in classic sports - for example, increased heart rate, stress reactions, hormonal changes."</seg>
<seg id="1634">"in addition, cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and a quick reaction capability are required."</seg>
<seg id="1635">Professional gamers should exercise not only on the console but also their body and respect nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="1636">"the custom player is a good player."</seg>
<seg id="1637">But Frobbing also sees problems: "doping is becoming more and more a topic."</seg>
<seg id="1638">"controls are difficult to perform at online games, and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing."</seg>
<seg id="1639">The scientist emphasises the high integrative effect of E-Sports.</seg>
<seg id="1640">"players are on the move internationally, this is like a big global family, there are no intercultural barriers."</seg>
<seg id="1641">A study by the management consultancy Deloitte and the Federal Association Interactive entertainment software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in e-sports.</seg>
<seg id="1642">"in 2016, 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany, mainly on advertising, sponsorship and big tournaments."</seg>
<seg id="1643">"in three years, sales are expected to be 130 million."</seg>
<seg id="1644">"with some 2.4 billion euros of the Bundesliga, this is little."</seg>
<seg id="1645">"however, the e-sport is not far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," the Deloitte advisers write. "</seg>
<seg id="1646">"internationally, many countries are already continuing."</seg>
<seg id="1647">"great markets are Asia and the USA, where ex-basketball players Shaquille O'Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez participate in the US team NRG eSports."</seg>
<seg id="1648">Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSport betting provider Unikrn.</seg>
<seg id="1649">There is a lot to do in Europe as well.</seg>
<seg id="1650">"in a Norwegian school, E-Sport has been introduced as a teaching subject, says Frobber."</seg>
<seg id="1651">"according to Dutt, the football-premier clubs in the Netherlands and France are now obliged to set up an e-sports department."</seg>
<seg id="1652">"in the European comparison Germany is lagging behind," explains VfB Executive Board Röttgermann. "</seg>
<seg id="1653">"to expire only in nostalgia, and to clear the old times is no longer enough today."</seg>
<seg id="1654">"the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association, but to align the company with the modern market at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1655">"we live in a digitized world," says Dutt. "</seg>

<seg id="1662">A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boyfriend through texts and calls for suicide.</seg>
<seg id="1663">"Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her sentence behind bars and five years have been exposed to probation."</seg>
<seg id="1664">"Carter was sentenced in June due to negligence by Conrad Roy, who took life on 13 July 2014."</seg>
<seg id="1665">The father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing: "my family is inconsolable.</seg>
<seg id="1666">My son was my best friend. "</seg>
<seg id="1667">Carter was allowed to remain free until his appeal.</seg>
<seg id="1668">"she was confronted with a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a psychological illness."</seg>
<seg id="1669">"dressed in red trousers and a cream-colored blouse, Carter stood with tears in her eyes, with folded hands and downward-looking eyes when she was convicted."</seg>
<seg id="1670">"her actions have killed Conrad Roy," said the prosecutor to the court. "</seg>
<seg id="1671">She finished his life in order to make her own better.</seg>
<seg id="1672">"she has no responsibility," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="1673">"she has not shown any regrets."</seg>
<seg id="1674">But Carter's lawyer said it was a "terrible circumstance that she completely regrets.</seg>
<seg id="1675">"judge Lawrence Moniz said, however, he did not find out that their age or maturity or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"a public prosecutor read a statement by Roys mother Lynn Roy, who said that there is" no day in which I do not feel the loss of my beloved son. "</seg>
<seg id="1677">"I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything. I try, in spite of all my pain that we will carry for eternity with us, to be there for his sisters," it says. "</seg>
<seg id="1678">"Roys's sister, Camdyn Roy, said that she would never take part in the wedding of her brother or be a aunt for his children."</seg>
<seg id="1679">"no longer this single person with whom I was together since my birth every day is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="1680">"the case seems to be a legal precedent because there is no law in Massachusetts, which makes it a crime to claim another, commit suicide."</seg>
<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1682">The case drew national attention after Carter revealed text messages that she had encouraged him to end his life.</seg>
<seg id="1683">"hang yourself up, jump from a building, get yourself, I don't know there are many ways," "she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"in the moments before his suicide, she wrote:" "you must do it, Conrad" "and" "Everything you need to do is turn on the generator and you'll be free and happy."</seg>
<seg id="1685">Judge Moniz told Carter's attention was directed by the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from the case by any press.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The case has shared the legal opinion.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Amanda Knox was one of the few who defended Carter in 2007 because of murder of her British roommate in Italy before she was acquitted two years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1688">"Ms. Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times:" Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not jail. "</seg>

<seg id="1708">"in addition to Kimmich, Rudy in front of the defense, Süle acted confidently."</seg>

<seg id="1756">"nitrogen oxides, emitting diesel engines, are considered to be carcinogens and can cause asthma."</seg>
<seg id="1757">"the cost of automakers to install systems to neutralize the exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles also increase, which makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive."</seg>

<seg id="1759">"companies try to avoid the mistakes made by Volkswagen, which could regulate the use of so-called shutdown devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested, but returning to normal driving conditions."</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">"the staff of the Weekly Riodoce usually meet Wednesdays to check their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa through organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars."</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to speak about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-level journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children into the office, which in 2009 were the target of an attack with grenades, or leave them at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"security experts have written three words on a plaque on the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"they ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and gut feelings suffice."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of standing on the government's salary list or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no rest from the violence, and while the corpses are accumulating throughout the country, more and more journalists are there: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto has been under federal protection and until now there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries this year."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter is her publisher and her inspirer of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1820">"two reporters in the 1930s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez wear t-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although a Sonder Federal Attorney General was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists, it only initiated two criminal proceedings, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most thousands of murders, each year associated with drug trafficking and organised crime, the murderers of journalists are rarely put on trial."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"at Riodoce they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are inconsolable and although the terrain is even more treacherous."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting for the discussion of security has little value, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we don't know why, we mistrust everyone."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"on the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - who is translated with" "Twelve river". ""</seg>
<seg id="1830">The Sagittarius drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown-up children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly around in Culiacan freely.</seg>
<seg id="1834">"but on the subject of Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence."</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzman's arrest in the past year and the extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, since rival factions struggle here to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-story Mausoleums for drug kings that are bigger than many homes for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "peace" if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable harbours and drug trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">"despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, broke with the blame that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first, there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzman's sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this release may have annoyed the sons, the presumed gang members purchased each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kiosks."</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second error was not forcing Valdez to leave the country for his own security after the confiscation of another newspaper that had published the same story.</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined forces with five colleagues for the establishment of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa," it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the drug problem, "said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1847">"over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporters loved to publish hard-fitting investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to treat."</seg>
<seg id="1849">"eight years after the foundation of Riodoce, she received the prestigious" Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize "for her coverage in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in the pursuit of Mexican drug history, wherever it led them."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave up voluntarily that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I would like to continue living," "he said at the time of the CPJ award."</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug trafficking in Sinaloa" is a way of life, "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV."</seg>
<seg id="1854">"you must take over the task that you as a journalist, either that or you play the dumb."</seg>
<seg id="1855">I don't want to be asked: "what have you done in the face of so many dead... why didn't you tell what was going on?</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun bird, who could curse as a dockworker, the friend who was generously embraced by hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always bear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">"now they ask, was his love for routine his destruction?"</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how to do their work best and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like to deal with their wives, their children, their clean businesses, their secret home and runways to move drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," "said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation."</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it smells wrong, stay away from it."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the anger is, the publisher of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that" "smell a sense that can be fooled... and then the thing happened to Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape changes constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"days before it became known that Spyware, which was sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">"outside, two policemen were looking for shelter from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree."</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a mid-class neighborhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the joke, some of the reporters asked themselves whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen who called the governor themselves as untrustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months since the reporters have gone to the mountain landscape, where drug gangs are de facto under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">"for the issue of this week, Riodoce has fucked on three main stories."</seg>
<seg id="1876">"there was the assassination of the brother of the former known, Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa."</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the state expenditures focused on the governor's hometown.</seg>
<seg id="1878">"there was a group located in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the Office of the Prosecutor, a kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who was kidnapped or as it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from the public record that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who ruled the governing Institutional Revolution Party (PRI) which dominated all political levels almost the whole century.</seg>
<seg id="1881">"recently, several PRI governors were indicted for high-calibre cases of corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman escaped a military attack."</seg>
<seg id="1883">"just a few months earlier, the readers would have considered the column of Valdez as the best informed source of kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1884">"earlier we had known what happened," "said Villarreal, 46, with nickname" "El Flaco" "because of his slim body stature."</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now, all channels of communication are broken with our sources."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"Valdez's office became a storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists, because the employees have become something they never expected: activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez snorted a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration for another journalist to the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">"Salvador Adamed disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western state of Michoacan."</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burned body was discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is his.</seg>
<seg id="1890">"throughout the country, journalists have become louder by writing in organized protests" SOS Press "on pavements and buildings."</seg>
<seg id="1891">"on that day, the director Bojorquez is gone away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"at a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spy on journalists and letting them kill them because they told the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"since then she has asked her to be re-divided by the government, because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime, government officials and a valid society."</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" Narco-Journalism, "he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also by the order of politicians and security forces that put together organised crime under a ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="1896">"last year, the media group" Articulo 19 "assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists of the police and officials."</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico you die, because they want you to keep your mouth," "said Ramirez."</seg>
<seg id="1898">"obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect."</seg>
<seg id="1899">No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">"her body was found together with a note, which was said to be signed by the Zetas-Kartell:" "here I am because of my reports."</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and headphone were located next to their separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua following the assassination of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue to do as El Manana by Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of their director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">"in 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the title page with the heading" What do you want from us? ""</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists have fled their home countries or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"it is difficult to find work in exile, and still watch the streets and search for dangers."</seg>

<seg id="1924">Researchers have now found out that the first findings of the unbelievable Nashorns of a Canadian miner have been preserved so well that experts have described it as "Mona Lisa der Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1925">It was so well received that they could even find that its scaly skin was of reddish brown - and they said they had something of an "restless past."</seg>
<seg id="1926">"the report in the magazine" Current Biology "described it as" the best-preserved, armored dinosaur that has ever been found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world. "</seg>
<seg id="1927">The fossil is a newly discovered type of Nodosaurier who lived between 110 million and 112 million years in the middle of the cycle time.</seg>
<seg id="1928">"his unbelievably well-preserved condition has startled researchers who describe it as" "really remarkable". ""</seg>
<seg id="1929">"according to reports in National Geographic, the armored plant eater is the best preserved fossil of its kind."</seg>
<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn Funk as he founded the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the North of Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met something that seemed to be missing from the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pound (1,100 kg) heavy earth-claws."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you only smile a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it slept," "said the chief author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature was to be seen."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will enter into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens, the Mona Lisa der Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers have discovered that this plant eater, although covered with a armor and resembles a changing tank, is probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the strongly armored dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used an shielding technique, which is known as counter-relief, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this would have allowed him to better mix himself in his surroundings and avoid his enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million-year-old creature from the family of the Nodosaurier made headlines for the first time in May and is now visible at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta Markmitchelli, according to the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours with it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">The astonishing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armour over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the counter-shading, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the tip of the creature was darker than its underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the counter shading is common, the results are surprising since the size of Borealopelta by far exceeds the animals living today."</seg>
<seg id="1945">"it indicates that the dinosaur hunts enough pressure by eating flesh-eating dinosaurs, that evolution encouraged the disguise of confrontation as a means of survival."</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most of the contemporary animals that use counter shading - think of deer, zebras or belt-animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loot, which signalizes that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur predators must have been the chalk-time," Brown said. "</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to investigate the animal on his life, including his serrated bowel to find out what it has eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaur when he died, got into a river and drove out into the sea, where he sank on his back to the seabed."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time, Alberta was as warm as south-florida today, and rivers and oceans probably much farther inland spreads than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal," Brown said. "</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal today looks almost the same as in the early cycle time.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. if you only squash a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that he is sleeping."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the cycle time was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs crossed the earth."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years to Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"the scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and mumified in mud."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk as he founded the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the North of Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the safest armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"on average, the creatures were about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long spikes that raged from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored plant eater was washed by western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater equipment of the dinosaur preserved its armor in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the house rules cover still bumpy armoured plates along the dinosaur</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as rare as a lotto gain."</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I approach, the more confusing it will."</seg>
<seg id="1968">Petrified remains of the skin still cover the bumpy armoured plates that carry the skull of the animal.</seg>
<seg id="1969">"his right front foot is on his side, his five fingers are spread upward."</seg>
<seg id="1970">I can count the scales on his sole.</seg>

<seg id="1999">"to be able to use them, however, some requirements must be met: you need a smartphone or tablet."</seg>

<seg id="2023">"the police have just killed a 18-year-old child, and it is still on the road," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="2024">"confused, as nobody else posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was continuously suppressed on her timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"the rapper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo."</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"that's wild," "said Ferrell."</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She removed her cell phone to return to Tweets on the Canfield Drive in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos of the police band and people shouting, and of a man who claimed to be Brown's father, who bore a sign with the inscription:" "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed boy!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">She watched a live feed in which a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said, another policeman voiced his rifle and cried," "I will kill you all."</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not common," "recalls Ferrell to her statement."</seg>
<seg id="2035">This is not the kind of murder we have used to and which we can call typical.</seg>
<seg id="2036">At that moment I felt shivers.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">"after the landing at 23 o'clock, she removed her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning."</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened over the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the subject of a new documentary film," Whose Streets?, "in cinemas from the 11."</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and power of resistance, who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"when Ferrell with her daughter, who wore a cauliflower and a matching crown, drove to Ferguson, the two discussed a conversation that they had countless times before this morning" about the black experience and the black condition. ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember, as I taught you, when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "she remembered what she said."</seg>
<seg id="2044">"we are now going to Ferguson, because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right."</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take her with me," "said Ferrell later."</seg>
<seg id="2046">What has happened today is a high point of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know it and see it and be drawn up in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed, not only activism and organisation, but also know the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience a blatant racism, she is no different from the next black women child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">I feel I would be doing a bad service to keep them away from it.</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-charge of officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"there, Ferrell and her daughter have joined with a local business owner who made lunch."</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">"slowly, a new type of activism began to take shape for Ferrell."</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed completely after 9 August," she said, noticing that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, President of the Minority Student Nurse Association and focused on food-justice and health inequalities in black communities. "</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organising.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It is all coming. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film during an evening demonstration."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to" "document" "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question came from Ferrell:" "do you want to document or try to find a story you can exploit?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this scepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often of whites - in a community who benefited from their pain and resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan recently said in an interview," "We heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan already collaborated with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist known for his activism around death penalty inmates."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"his commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals followed the team of" Whose Streets? "in the years after Browns firing."</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us. we talk," Davis said. "</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me, how these people will be presented, for that's how I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the" movement "is not a messiah leader, but a community that is coming together," said Folayan - it proved to be the most open participant in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="2068">"consequently, documents of" Whose Streets "show surprising personal aspects of Ferrell's life, as she falls in love with her wife."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," "said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I understand that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and in the humanisation of black people.</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferrell's history repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives-Matter movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, who, following the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, marked the film" Blacklive Matter "in social media, identify themselves as gay."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay men must bear the main burden of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"Folayan agreed to note that" "the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it insists that" this is not an affirmatically type of action, "in which Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film because of her identity."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who stirred up this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is no accident, although it was at the forefront, because in a life at these crossings as a black, gay woman is so much at stake."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"in the meantime, the news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared, but the racial connections between the church and the police continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on parole for 2 ½ years because of the blocking of a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">It describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area that she calls her home: "chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">"however, she clings to a song and she feels committed to this memory, since she went on the street three years ago in Ferguson."</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We need to love and support one another.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "Dream" to "megalomania": TV readers discuss bit-gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves people even though it is not built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping mall at the south end of the pedestrian zone splits the population into proponents and opponents since its first presentation in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The topic hardly leaves any cold.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"while the one to the bit gallery say:" "that would be a dream" "(Anja Becker) or" That's really great "(Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side:" no man needs "(Siggi Betzen) or quite simply:" megalomania! "(Lars Scholz)."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while the proponents build that a gallery attracts more customers to the city, as well as the rest of the shops, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"in addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farmers market hall stands, in which 13 direct markets offer their products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"with the start of the construction work, it will be concluded."</seg>
<seg id="2097">The Galerie-makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - for Beda-Platz with possibility to sit outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">"Simone Room:" for many years, we have been selling almost weekly in the farmer's market hall. "</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the country women always gladly again."</seg>
<seg id="2100">We also discovered the butcher's shop for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would wish that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"in other cities, there is also this."</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether direct marketing can settle in a market hall in the gallery will amount to the amount of rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">But this should not be very low in the new project. "</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "what are the shopping palaces in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">"whether clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I think it is superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There is enough of them in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but since there is not even a decent weekly market here, it is all the more important that at least the market hall will be preserved."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the product offered there is fresh, is mostly offered directly from the producer and is also inexpensive."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you can see, shops in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies, because the rents there are often not portable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"a pity, specialty shops are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping centre with a market hall doesn't suit me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">"first of all, where is the peasant market hall going to go down during the construction period?"</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery is actually coming.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does the ghost-bit gallery manage to sell all the stores from Bitburg before?</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "it simply won't work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping center that is empty, no one needs."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farmer's market instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"but for a peasant market hall, thanks to the insanely many - as I find - meaningless construction projects in Bitburg no longer place."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"once the farmers market hall is destroyed, a piece of culture will disappear again."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A suitable similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning's DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are visible - white, black and brown, which are almost inconspicuous, hanging on cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheeks-tugs and haircuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former secret service analyticist served a 35-year prison sentence after being publicly classified as a secret diplomatist about the WikiLeaks website."</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A Becoming resemblance (a suitable similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">"she is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a Transwife and a groundbreaking dissident, whose conviction has been transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"Dewey-Hagborg has created an algorithmic analysis of DNA, which has been extracted from Manning and created from the 30 portraits, a sharp, albeit somewhat intellectual comment not only to the forms of DNA data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has already talked openly about the identification as a woman since her puberty, has been convicted for 20 charges, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"her image was suppressed by the prison, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-and-white selfie, in which Manning clearly sits on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum blonde wig - with which she was associated."</seg>
<seg id="2133">"in 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was just from the great success of its 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'."</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in this, the artist produced portraits of forensic artefacts like cigarette butt and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look."</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when she received an e-mail from a magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in jail, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition. "</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed, so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"the artist and her incarcerated muse were too unequal, who changed several letters over the course of two years."</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created one of Shoili Kanungo illustrated comics" "Suppressed Images", "which foresaw a future in which the President Chelating would convert judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"that Obama actually had only a few days after the book was published, Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome way of happy coincidence."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also now at the opening of the exhibition something deep and strong, as Donald Trump is leading a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to keep the rigid divisions that he should actually fix."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"when Dewey-Hagborg was asked after the strange timing of all these things, she said that" things happen for a particular reason. ""</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery Manning called with her oversized signature underneath (the" i "in her family name is equipped with a heart) an end of" automatic fragmentation, of which sex, race, sexuality and culture have been. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall, its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandth of Cs and Gs and As, is written in pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides after the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist), as astonishingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take away is that our genome is not about who we are and how openly genetic data is for interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is a page from the above mentioned comic novel."</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning how she appears with a hands-on hands in the hands of the United States discipline barracks as King Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they cool your speech, then they won." "</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so, never stop the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter she wrote to me," "said the artist, who greeted me from Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">I still get goosebumps when I talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="2154">Manning hasn't seen the exhibition personally - just as it should be anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it then she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks from her own genomic simulacons that are like hordes of protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2155">"this was also target-oriented, like everything in the exhibition, to the size (5" 2, Manning Statur), where their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past, I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," "said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits."</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was hiding behind its liberation."</seg>

<seg id="2159">"a nationwide chase is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University, who became suspects after a man had been stabbed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries."</seg>
<seg id="2160">On Monday Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) were issued arrest warrants for murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.</seg>
<seg id="2161">"the documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches."</seg>
<seg id="2162">A joint warning system published by the Police Authority of Chicago states that the body was discovered on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="2163">"officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body."</seg>
<seg id="2164">"Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead in the place of the action, and detectives inspect the stitches as murder, while the police are actively searching for the two suspects, officials said."</seg>
<seg id="2165">Lathem has been Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="2166">"Alan K. Cubbage, the vice-president for university relations, said in an e-mail explaining that Lathem should now be overwhelmed and excluded from entering the Campus of Northwestern University."</seg>
<seg id="2167">"this is now a criminal affair that is examined by the competent authorities, and the Northwestern University cooperates with this investigation," said Cubbage. "</seg>
<seg id="2168">Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A spokesman for the university and the Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that "we are in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the US investigative authorities in any way possible.</seg>
<seg id="2170">The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to stand.</seg>
<seg id="2171">"chief Communications Officer of the Police Authority of Chicago, Anthony Guglielmi, said he strongly urge the suspects to face the authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the police have an idea of their place of residence, and our efforts to locate them strengthen," said Guglielmi. "</seg>
<seg id="2173">"Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities help to find the suspects."</seg>
<seg id="2174">"Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious hint saying that something happened in apartment 1008."</seg>
<seg id="2175">The police described the scene as very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="2177">Security cameras confirmed that Lathem and Warren were in the building.</seg>
<seg id="2178">"we believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said. "</seg>

<seg id="2183">"the WADA roadmap was updated in this respect," "said Mutko on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="2184">"the PM commited the second part of the WADA roadmap to comply with the code, which describes the criteria for the restoration of RUSADA and was recently published on the website of the Organization."</seg>
<seg id="2185">"according to Mutko, he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"everything was announced, everything is being implemented."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," "he added."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"however, one of the criteria mentioned in the list shows that the Russian anti-doping authorities have to publicly accept the results of the investigation approved by the WADA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren to alleged federally funded doping in Russian sports."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"regarding the matter, Mutko said:" "we carry out the investigation as our anti-doping system has made a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="2190">All measures have been implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2191">"but there were no government programmes, and we will not admit something that does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="2192">"mutex's words coincided with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian anti-doping commission."</seg>
<seg id="2193">"in conversation with the Russian sales outlet rsport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov gave problems to the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but added:" we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations. "</seg>
<seg id="2194">"no one has to accept this report unconditionally," Smirnov said. "</seg>
<seg id="2195">"in November 2015, RUSADA was expelled from the WADA by the implementation of doping controls in Russia in November 2015."</seg>

<seg id="2209">A new Human Resources Start-Up race is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">"by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement, it enables companies to offer surveys, offer specialist groups and demographic groups, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass the C-Suite leaders and turn directly to the Board of Directors."</seg>

<seg id="2291">"in his recent past, the little Scotney Castle was to be seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970's and 1980-s."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"but Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from its cozy seat in the Conscious River Valley in Kent, and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaiv Yorkshire with a predilection for historical documents."</seg>

<seg id="2294">What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"a Castle in England spanned the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scotney. each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Steiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg."</seg>
<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes that is based on an archive: he wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories' - a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotional.</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I only responded to the thumb print on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700's, who worked for the Jacobins," he says. "</seg>

<seg id="2306">"the intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown, since the National Trust received full access until 2006, when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died."</seg>

<seg id="2310">"some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse themselves in the English history, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the Peasant Peasant of 1381."</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of a turmoil that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Family of Kent and Sussex', Rhodes says."</seg>

<seg id="2338">"every year at the beginning of August, Ankara is advising the Supreme Military Council (YAS) about retirement and promotions in the officer corps."</seg>

<seg id="2340">At first glance a normal operation.</seg>
<seg id="2341">But nothing is a routine for the Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt.</seg>

<seg id="2343">"under the presidency of the Prime Minister, the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs Minister also took part in the discussions."</seg>

<seg id="2348">"more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged links to the movement of the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, which Erdogan sees as the wireactor of the coup attempt."</seg>
<seg id="2349">486 people who have been involved in the coup attempt have been negotiated in Ankara since this week.</seg>
<seg id="2350">"already on the day after the coup, Erdogan had called the overthrow attempt as a" "gift of God", "as he gave him the opportunity to completely clean the armed forces."</seg>
<seg id="2351">But does Erdogan really handle the army?</seg>
<seg id="2352">"at the end of February, the newspaper" Hürriyet "published an article entitled" Uneasiness in the Military Headquarters. ""</seg>

<seg id="2354">"in any case, the massacre of the army and the security forces continues."</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in mid-July, Erdogan fired more than 7395 heads of state, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers."</seg>
<seg id="2356">It seemed as though Erdogan had tamed the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">The generals were earlier than the actual Lords of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2358">Three times they putted their role as guardians of the secular state order.</seg>
<seg id="2359">"following his election victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed back the power of the military step by step, not least by calling on the reform agenda of the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2360">Former officers say Erdogan is specifically driving an Islamization of the armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="2361">"in the magazine" Vocal Europe, "a particularly unnamed officer, who sought asylum from fear of persecution in foreign countries, warned that the Turkish army would be" full of extremists and salafists in a few years. ""</seg>

<seg id="2389">"just as you thought it can't become even more crazy in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"yes, actually."</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big deal.</seg>
<seg id="2392">The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must start taking her ascension seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and type of finger nail."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more often," said Mr Sharkey in the publication of his new report. "</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex puppets have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can also adjust his robot according to his convictions, and select everything from the eye color of the robot over the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but it is even more disturbing since many robots have the" "personalities" "that would make a Stepford woman progressive."</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex puppets have developed into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"for example, the RealBotix robot allows users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing, such as shyness."</seg>
<seg id="2401">"and then there is the Roxxxy Gold Robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities like" Frigid Farrah, "which conveys the impression of shyness and" Wild Wendy "with an" adventurous "personality."</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality, which is adapted to your personality as well as possible," enthuses the website of True Companion. "</seg>
<seg id="2403">"so she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">"in the course of the day, she also has her moods - just like real people!"</seg>
<seg id="2405">"it can be tired, be fixed on conversation or it can be" "in mood" "!"</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female characteristics, the allusions to rape, when one goes one step to Frigid (called here: reluctant) Farrah, restless one the most."</seg>
<seg id="2407">"true Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men not have Roxxxy?" it says on the website. "</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"their formation and increasing refinement indicate something hazy and deeper in our culture, towards a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition."</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men will, of course, do not hold any sex robots, and while the FRR notes their increasing popularity, they remain at the edge of consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"but what is permeated from the marginal zones, can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live."</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market is given permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">"there is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots are emerging in a time when the rights of women are threatened worldwide, in which there is a president in the White House who has boasted to have women sexually assaulted."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"the most deterrent aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the handmaid ') is not the graphic images, the worn body and the out-out eyes, but how realistic this vision works."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap."</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as possible (albeit with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, brought to the point when it comes to their" personalities, "the robots are not real women."</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"they have no mediation or background story, nothing that hinders independence or anything that could disturb the fantasy of total subjugation."</seg>
<seg id="2422">"in other words, they are counterfeit slaves."</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the speech of 2017: maids</seg>
<seg id="2424">Pumps great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of healthy human understanding</seg>
<seg id="2426">"it has become a bump-wisdom of the Trump era that the political divisions, which polarized the US electorate, also split families in small format."</seg>

<seg id="2430">"I mention this because my cousin, a left-looking poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York."</seg>
<seg id="2431">It reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">"with Trump in the White House everyone who knows them, including the republican relationship with which she had fought for decades for politics, suddenly and completely strange on the same side."</seg>
<seg id="2433">"this is certainly a good thing for the dining table, but it seems to me that this also entails considerable risks."</seg>
<seg id="2434">"the left was strengthened by Trump, but the disfiguring effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right."</seg>
<seg id="2435">"when we speak of" "normalization" "and" "Trump", "we are referring to the creepy possibility that one day his kittens will no longer be repulsed."</seg>
<seg id="2436">"there is, however, an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump Republicans of the right wing are" normalized, "which suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness."</seg>
<seg id="2437">"I find myself today by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's urcomical version of the decline - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return) - both compared to Trump in fact occur as a very mild crime."</seg>
<seg id="2438">"if Trump is going, the next candidate of the Republicans must be mentally healthy to qualify as immeasurable improvement."</seg>
<seg id="2439">"when my cousin was in the city, we brought our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousels of the New York Park department, and the best three dollars that you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine."</seg>

<seg id="2493">The most important questions and answers at a glance.</seg>
<seg id="2494">"BMW, Daimler, Opel and the Volkswagen Group offer software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars on the diesel summit."</seg>
<seg id="2495">They should improve the emission level of cars from the Euro 5 emissions classes and some Euro 6.</seg>
<seg id="2496">Euro-4 diesel or worse are excluded.</seg>
<seg id="2497">Anja Smetanin from ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments:</seg>
<seg id="2498">Is the new action mandatory?</seg>
<seg id="2499">No. the software updates negotiated are voluntary.</seg>
<seg id="2500">"the mandatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles that have the Schuman Software," "says Anja Smetanin."</seg>
<seg id="2501">Their retrofitting has arranged the Federal Aviation Office (KBA).</seg>
<seg id="2502">How and when will customers be informed about updates?</seg>
<seg id="2503">"the manufacturers announced a rapid implementation in the coming months, but not yet called an exact date."</seg>
<seg id="2504">Daimler advised to write to any person affected.</seg>
<seg id="2505">"if an inspection is due anyway, this will be done in their framework."</seg>
<seg id="2506">How long will the conversions go down altogether?</seg>
<seg id="2507">"difficult to say," says Smetanin. "</seg>
<seg id="2508">The hangings depend on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from the political pressure.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"for we have seen, voluntarily the automakers do not act on the topic of the environment so far."</seg>
<seg id="2510">How long should the update last?</seg>
<seg id="2511">The changeover itself could last only three to four hours in the workshop.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Time-consuming could be to get an appointment.</seg>

<seg id="2523">The first award ceremony under President Trump promises to be political.</seg>
<seg id="2524">One of the winners does not want to come - from protest.</seg>

<seg id="2526">"as the cultural institution announced on Thursday, singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) and the choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and the TV producer Norman Lear (95) are among the scholars."</seg>
<seg id="2527">The awards will be handed over at the beginning of December.</seg>

<seg id="2535">"Roland Wacker, Haslach city building master, goes to retirement in the coming year."</seg>
<seg id="2536">"the place is already written, but suitable candidates are rare."</seg>
<seg id="2537">Wacker Stadtbaumeister has been a city builder for 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="2538">And the work still makes him great fun as he mediates in the press briefing.</seg>
<seg id="2539">"he reports from diverse, but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor."</seg>
<seg id="2540">"at the same time, it is surprising that so far no application has fulfilled the requirement profile."</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">"in this way, considering the regular periods of notice, there should be enough time for a familiarisation."</seg>
<seg id="2543">"since Haslach is responsible for the administrative community as a sub-contractor, the applicant has to draw the relevant conclusions."</seg>
<seg id="2544">Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">"if it would no longer be able to fill it out, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice."</seg>
<seg id="2546">"but close proximity to the town and to him is important, says Wacker, who reports from a good working atmosphere and a good mood between authority and citizen."</seg>
<seg id="2547">"in more than 30 years in office, some major projects have accumulated, which Wacker looks back with pride."</seg>
<seg id="2548">"we make the city livable," he is confident about the building department and its employees. "</seg>
<seg id="2549">But also in the future varied projects are on the agenda: the reshaping of the former Hukla areals and the Niederhof parking space for example are initiated.</seg>
<seg id="2550">"the bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed, even the stadium renovation is still a topic."</seg>
<seg id="2551">"the latter will be able to book about 1.5 million euros," if we do it correctly, "Wacker estimates."</seg>
<seg id="2552">"all in all, great tasks await my successor."</seg>
<seg id="2553">The work here is fun. "</seg>
<seg id="2554">"in terms of design, there is great clearance for a city builder."</seg>
<seg id="2555">"with Haslach's own building yard and gardening, it is possible to react to many things quite flexibly."</seg>
<seg id="2556">"one can move much," said Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned lauingly by citizens and visitors. "</seg>
<seg id="2557">"as the old town as an ensemble is under monument protection, it is important to" have an eye for what is going on, "when new buildings are approved, the retiring city builder emphasizes."</seg>
<seg id="2558">"anyway, the Stadtbaumeister carries a high level of responsibility."</seg>
<seg id="2559">"he is a builder," "in the end everything is going well above my table."</seg>
<seg id="2560">"with care and coordination, he can count on many years of staff: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been there for ten years, Manfred Schöner (civil engineering) has been working for 15 years."</seg>
<seg id="2561">"also, that his successor remains long, Wacker wishes:" we are looking for someone who really wants to be identified and left with the job. "</seg>
<seg id="2562">"continuity is not only important for a good working climate, but also for the further design of the city."</seg>
<seg id="2563">Anyone who wants to inherit Roland Wacker should have a completed degree as a graduate engineer or a bachelor's degree in architecture according to the city of Haslach and have good expertise in the fields of building and construction planning law.</seg>
<seg id="2564">"the Stadtbauamt (Stadtbauamt) is subject to civil and civil engineering, building guidelines, residential properties, administration of urban properties, urban depot with building yard and urban gardening, as well as the civil rights authority, including monument protection."</seg>
<seg id="2565">Bike thrown on lines: southern track closed</seg>
<seg id="2566">"according to the police, the previously unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railroad tracks in the area of the Leoben Street (B116) onto the lines."</seg>
<seg id="2567">These were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2568">The investigators go from two male perpetrators and have been searching for them since the night.</seg>
<seg id="2569">"near the scene of the crime, a pink scooter and a bicycle driver were observed by witnesses."</seg>
<seg id="2570">"this goes far beyond a Lusatian Empire," said ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch to the APA. "</seg>
<seg id="2571">"the perpetrators, or the perpetrators, would have put themselves in danger and also endanger the traffic."</seg>
<seg id="2572">"in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant, as well as the delay and the cost of rail transport, Pönalen will also be able to respond to the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2573">"overall, the spokesman said."</seg>
<seg id="2574">"the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon, the rail traffic on the south railway line could be led without disabilities."</seg>
<seg id="2575">"almost ten passenger trains had dropped out on Friday morning, two of which were related to the long-distance traffic."</seg>
<seg id="2576">"freight trains did not fall out, but they had delays."</seg>
<seg id="2577">"according to ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch, some 200 meters of overhead lines had to be replaced."</seg>
<seg id="2578">Insulators and masts were also damaged.</seg>
<seg id="2579">"red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)"</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">"but a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable condition affecting around 1.3 million and in the United Kingdom 300,000 causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue."</seg>
<seg id="2583">Researchers at the Washingtoner University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan contributes to the development of immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the senior researcher, Dr Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the gut patrol in order to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food do not penetrate the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">"cells that are capable of triggering inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body, without damaging sensitive tissues."</seg>
<seg id="2586">"if the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments have been found that a type of tolerance promoting immune cells occurs in mice that carry a specific bacterium in their intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - in order to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have established a link between a species of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had from these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. Cruteri and an diet that is rich in tryptophan, encourages more tolerant, less inflammatory bowel milieus when the same system is also working with people."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the post-doctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigated a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was but separated, this did not have."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"it assumed that the difference with the intestinal microbious mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the intestines of the mice were sequenced, and six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells were found, but were missing in mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"mice were wound up in a sterile environment, so that an intestinal microbiome was missing and they did not develop this kind of immune cells, and they received the L. Cruteri and the immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"in order to understand how the bacteria impacted on the immune system, the researchers L. Cruteri were able to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells isolated from the mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"when the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism, known as an idol-3 lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"if the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the food of mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but if the tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">"Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that people have the same tolerant cells as mice, and that most of us are helping L. Cruteri in our gastrointestinal tracts."</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether Tryptophan-byproducts from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in humans with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said," "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines."</seg>
<seg id="2603">"potentially, high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population."</seg>

<seg id="2622">"new blow for Martin Schulz - Hanover, we have a problem"</seg>
<seg id="2623">"as the wind turns out: when Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD boss, Social-Democratic Prime Minister had always looked for Berlin with a certain concern."</seg>
<seg id="2624">"only no fire from the party centre, but no headwind from the Confederation, was the most important desire of the electoral campaigners."</seg>
<seg id="2625">"since Martin Schulz leads the party, this has fundamentally changed."</seg>
<seg id="2626">"since then, the staff from Willy-Brandt-Haus closely monitor the events in the provincial capitals of the German Democratic Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2627">"what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year, would not be described in the approach with headwinds."</seg>
<seg id="2628">It was deep.</seg>
<seg id="2629">And one after another.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"after the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the Federal CDU sees a general signal against coalition of the SPD and the Greens."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"this once again shows: red-green cannot be reliably ruled out," "said CDU Secretary-General Peter Tauber to the editorial network Germany (RND)."</seg>
<seg id="2632">The government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) has overthrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) in a serious crisis.</seg>
<seg id="2633">"five months before the state elections, his red-green coalition lost its single-vote majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP."</seg>
<seg id="2634">The Green federal managing director Michael Kellner called on Elke Tlifejackets to give back their mandate.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The transition to CDU means a clear distortion of the electorate's will.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"Elke Tlifejackets must immediately return her mandate," "said the Federal Executive Officer and election campaign manager of the Green Party of Germany (RND)."</seg>
<seg id="2637">"this must not be true," "an SPD election campaigner sighs when the new hijacking message reaches the party centre on Friday morning."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, stands for the transition from the green deputies Elke Tlifejackets to the CDU without its own government majority."</seg>
<seg id="2639">It is the preliminary climax of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD state associations.</seg>
<seg id="2640">And nobody knows what's next.</seg>
<seg id="2641">The misery began with the unexpectedly sharp defeat at the Saarland election in March.</seg>
<seg id="2642">"a blue eye, no more, the comrades at that time reassured."</seg>
<seg id="2643">"after the legislative elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different."</seg>
<seg id="2644">That's what it became - and everything got much worse.</seg>
<seg id="2645">"the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into a marrow, the Düsseldorf-Pleite flared the party smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="2646">Comrades in the weeks afterwards laboriously racked up again.</seg>
<seg id="2647">"then, when they had just hatched new courage, the G-20 summit came from Hamburg."</seg>
<seg id="2648">And with him came the next blow.</seg>
<seg id="2649">"mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD in the SPD, lost his Nimbus on that weekend because he was sitting in the Elbphilharmonie while his city burned."</seg>
<seg id="2650">"and because in the crisis communication he did everything wrong, which can be done wrong."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"since then, Scholz is fighting for his political survival."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Now also Stephan Weil.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"due to the VW exhaust affaires and its role in the Supervisory Board, the Lower Saxony's Prime Minister has been in criticism for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="2654">Some survey values were added.</seg>
<seg id="2655">"nevertheless, or perhaps precisely for this reason, Weil has always tried to set accents in the Bund in recent weeks."</seg>
<seg id="2656">"the efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand its power in Berlin, too, did not remain hidden in the context of Martin Schulz."</seg>
<seg id="2657">"they let him go, because they spoke of Weil a stabilization of the party."</seg>
<seg id="2658">Now the exact opposite could occur.</seg>
<seg id="2659">"at the same time, Weil meets the non-party constraint of the Lower Saxon Greens in essence no fault."</seg>
<seg id="2660">And Schulz was not at all.</seg>
<seg id="2661">"in the meantime, the comrades endeavour to keep their own ranks closed."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"their anger is directed toward the Greens, and here above all, to the backsliding enteriess Tvest."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"it is unbearable and democratic, as Mrs. Tvester places her own career fairs on the interests of all others," "says Matthias Miersch, head of the party left in the SPD Parliamentary Group, the editorial network Germany (RND)."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"Ms. Tlifejackets is not elected as a direct candidate because of her person, but has been elected to parliament over the country list of the Lower Saxon Greens, according to the deputies of Lower Saxony."</seg>

<seg id="2697">"Gotzel stressed, an essential factor for success for the project is the participation of those involved."</seg>

<seg id="2718">"the helicopter manufactured in Connecticut has been exhibited alongside a maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire truck and a fork lift from Mississippi."</seg>
<seg id="2719">"the military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or Frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter."</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with a high visibility," "wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event to his superior, the Assistant Naval Commander for Aviation."</seg>
<seg id="2721">"the message showed that the helicopter arrived on the South Lawn on 17 July at 3 o'clock in the morning, and so long remained until the lawn was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00 in this evening."</seg>
<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the departure from the White House was delayed due to the limitation of service hours a second team would need for the return flight.</seg>
<seg id="2723">"the original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, while the safety personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the plane."</seg>
<seg id="2724">"from the records provided by TIME, it was not clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required."</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act prohibits federal states to use state property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Data sets indicate that HMX-1 has asked if the event might hurt the destination.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch acts and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="2728">"sounds as if you're locked up," "answered the deputy commander."</seg>
<seg id="2729">The event "Made in America" was designated as an official event by the White House and was not covered by the Hatch Act.</seg>
<seg id="2730">But also official events have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="2731">"at the event, the President gave an impetus to the reform of health reforms going on in the Senate and he propagated the efforts to curb government regulations."</seg>

<seg id="2745">Unit records record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="2746">The White House argues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below this rate.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "the cost of taxpayers based on estimates for refunds is highly misleading," "said Walters."</seg>
<seg id="2748">"these estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual means."</seg>
<seg id="2749">"according to a RAND study from 2015, the reimbursement rates for DoD do not include personnel costs, but consider the costs of fuel, maintenance and conclusion of contract."</seg>
<seg id="2750">"at this time the former press spokesperson of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the deployment of the helicopter for the event."</seg>

<seg id="2891">The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2892">"Christian Weisnden, spokesman for the reform movement" Wir sind Kirche "(" Wir sind Kirche "), said after publication to the German press agency, he expected from the former Regensburg bishop and present Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and the Cathedral Choir of Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the Pope Benedict XVI, an apology."</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret about their own omissions or their false appraisal of the processes at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"on the other hand, the Vatican paper" Osservatore Romano "criticised that reporting on violence in the Domspatzen could be measured with" double standards. ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">"no one doubted concerning the attacks in Regensburg that it was" shameful and shameful acts, "which would have to be punished and prevented in the future; but striking is the" degree of media manipulation, "says the author Lucetta Scaraffia, Historian and member of the National Italian Bioethics Committee."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit of denying the Catholic Church as the source of all evils is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep it normal," writes Scaraffia. "</seg>
<seg id="2897">Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: "we like to go to the church and that's a bonfire."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"she also pointed out that in her youth," "blows" "had been a very normal educational tool," "to be done with cheeky children, as I was one."</seg>
<seg id="2899">"it would be unfair to apply today's standards to earlier decades, as the world has changed."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"in connection with the reports on the abuse of abuse, the Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"completely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who authored the memory book" My brother of the pope "with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection," says Hesemann, "for all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report. "</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is written in the 440-page report submitted by the Bistum Regensburg with the clarification of the lawyer Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s with high plausibility.</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report it is called Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994:" in summary, it can be said that in many cases Domkapellmeister R. has been used in many cases of physical and psychological violence. "</seg>
<seg id="2906">"in the case of high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more severe."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"nevertheless, in contrast to many other accused, many victims have appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in numerous cases, even positive memories connect with him."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger in his opinion is relieved."</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" incidents of violent exercise on protective charcoal in the Regensburger Domspatzen "shows a contradictory picture by Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2910">"on the one hand, many pupils raise their" humanity. ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"on the other hand, he also appears as a chiceriker and perfectionist who has become tangible to the greener if a domino doesn't produce top performance musically."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this report as a biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: if you make the effort and read all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger actually occurs in it."</seg>
<seg id="2914">He has just been devoted to eight pages and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses of violence at the pre-school also took place outside of his sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">"you can at best reproach him, learn from it too late or not take first hints seriously enough."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the home gymnasium in which he was working was felt as literally" "redemption", "" "heaven" "and" "better world" "by practically all respondents."</seg>
<seg id="2918">"the broad majority of his students Georg Ratzinger presents an excellent testimony," "sincere", "" "sincere", "" "sincere", "" "sincere", "" "sincere", "" "sincere", "" "sincere", "" "sincere", "" "competent" "and" "understanding", "as highly benevolent teachers who regularly nourished the boys with cakes, biscuits and candy and" "always surrounded by children's grapes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2919">"only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which also led to flood breakdowns."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"he did not only knead with chairs and cast the keys on the floor, but also cast ear figs and too cheeky guys on the hair or ears, deeply regretted and apologized for that."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"to his salvation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the frail time, the 1960s and 1970s, with parents and teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I also experienced this in a secular school, a state school."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what is actually happening in this report, namely, the horrific sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the preschool, these are certainly bagatelles."</seg>
<seg id="2926">One wonders whether it is not to do with his fame and role as a brother of Benedict XVI that many media have just plunged on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">"in the Bavarian Pope, many who have never understood him are still working diligently."</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves George Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in the media, the report reported a lot about abuse among the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger responsible for involvement in sexual abuse in the final report also with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claims to have entrusted himself to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I never dared to talk to my father or mother about it," "said one of those affected," "It was all very embarrassing to me."</seg>
<seg id="2935">"the real problem in educating sexual abuse was, however, that most of the victims are silent."</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they don't even trust parents and siblings, then certainly not a choral leader, who, to a certain extent, would have been a colleague of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do Domspatzen students Ratzinger's role in terms of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student expressed it like this: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had had timely findings and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I think it... also for really absurd to assume that it is imputed to him... Bues have opened insistently or even more clearly than in relation to their parents, dormitory leaders, trust teachers, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"in this way, the report concludes with the very clear result:" "in the run-up to affected pupils and / or their surroundings, it could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"so, as far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is thus acquitted of all co-workers."</seg>
<seg id="2943">He cannot be accused of preventing or having brought him to an advert.</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore, there is no reason to link his good name with these conflicting crimes, as unfortunately happened in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"in the media, much of" "Violence of Violence" "was to be read at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2946">"the former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "Look" "in the report."</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem that in reporting everything was mixed and mixed up to a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">But that is exactly what misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"it is separated cleanly: between the pre-school and the high school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violence, and, we say, other accusations."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"the report also covers incidents from the time since 1945, so also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not a conductor of the Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"all the terrible test pedagogy, the cases in which the boys of sadistic teachers were slanted and discouraged, were all taken at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions have to prevail."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with them, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he only got the boys face when they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"this was, like most of the witnesses, emphasise the topic of" "primary school". ""</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was just happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradise" conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different on the Domsplitter gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but no sadistic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" many victims have appreciated the general humanness of R. "and therefore in many cases even combine positive memories with him."</seg>
<seg id="2959">"in this way, at most, the accusation remains to have looked away."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"despite all efforts, the report was able to define only two periods in which it was reported by the states at the preschool."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible, (so the witness) did not want to hear anything, and then only around 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger consequently cut out his ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, who even reproduces the report."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this, he points out that in the pre-school there will continue to practice testing."</seg>
<seg id="2965">"already in the face of the danger of negative press release, he recommended urgent action."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"this was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, as testing punishments were also banned in Bavaria for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before that, they were in a legal grey area, as each one of us knows well."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"it was also difficult for him to estimate, where the affected might be exaggerated or dramatized and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he has always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">"only in 1980, the test was officially abolished in schools in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's educational standards to the time at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see this?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we are talking about the" fall of anachronism, "that is, the danger of judging the past of today's moral standards."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess was right there.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abhorred at all times, and not for what has been done in the pre-school of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, which goes far beyond the practice back then."</seg>
<seg id="2977">That's all very awful and I'm glad that it will finally work out.</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time, I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection, because all this had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"its means of disciplining and punishment, i.e., ear figs and hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"as a physical punishment then forbidden, he has also kept strict adherence to it."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"which picture of his Regensburg time has Georg Ratzinger reproduced in the talks with you for the book" "My brother of the Pope" "?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the subject of a test fine also in the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI says from his perspective, there the domes played only a minor role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"in spite of this, I was by no means refusing to lead a strict regiment there."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but this also has to be said: without this perfectionism, without demanding discipline, it would hardly have been possible to form a world trang institution, true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and sweets alone, the rebellious boys do not once again make a great singer and before every success, regardless of what area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming."</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of person did you experience Georg Ratzinger during the talks with her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond that, I met Georg Ratzinger very well and again and again experienced as wonderful, humorous, basic, deeply believing and heartfelt people, that one could not imagine that he could only do something to fly."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I regularly get in touch with how many former Domspatzen today, 23 years after his Emeriding, regularly contact him, visit him, read it - he's almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who do not forgive him until today, that he was once strict to them, are clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the Domspatzen today are grateful to him for enriching their lives and bringing them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he always was a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovely respectful person, to which they still look up and worship them today."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once again clearly: all that is accused of, are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have overcome this time long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is most unjust, a man just because he is prominently and has an even more prominent brother to make a medial scapegoat."</seg>
<seg id="2996">The evil intent behind it is only too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">"the report, which was just published, relieves him."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the stand would command, a 93-year-old man who acquired great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps no one would probably know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace."</seg>
