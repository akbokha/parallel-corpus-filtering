28 @-@ year @-@ old chef found dead in San Francisco Mall
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in a local shopping centre .
&quot; the victim &apos;s brother said he could not imagine anyone who would harm him , &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally it turned up again with him . &quot;
the cor@@ pse found on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field Mall was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gali@@ cia from San Francisco and shared the legal department in San Francisco .
the San Francisco Police Department said that death was classified as murder and the investigations are running .
&quot; the victim &apos;s brother , Louis Gali@@ cia , shared his dream job as a chef at the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago . &quot;
a spokesman for the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said that they were shocked and destroyed on the ground about his death .
&quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot;
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are in this difficult time at Fran@@ ks &apos;s family and friends .
&quot; Louis Gali@@ cia admitted that Frank lived first in Host@@ els , but that &quot; things for him finally went uphill . &quot;
&quot; he found an apartment , he had a girlfriend , &quot; said Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot;
Louis Gali@@ cia said he could not imagine anyone who would harm his younger brother .
he was a friendly man with a great heart .
&quot; to connect his family to his family was to always make us cook , prepare dinner , &quot; &quot; said Louis Gali@@ cia . &quot;
he never wanted to take part in any kind of confrontation .
he was the brother who swa@@ m with the river .
&quot; in all that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond which ligh@@ tened every day , &quot; he said . &quot;
anyone who has information about the case is asked to call the sign @-@ on of the SF@@ PD under the number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put in drawers
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston does not always have to be perfect or successful .
the Hollywood star has now clearly made it clear in an interview .
&quot; I always get stuck in drawers or glued from the outside label , which usually have little to do with me and the reality . &quot;
I don &apos;t have the desire to always be perfect and successful .
&quot; to be honest , these things are more likely to me . &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about it as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as explained in the current &quot; Cos@@ m@@ opolitan . &quot;
&quot; the act@@ ress likes to spend her time at home , in front of a TV with loose de@@ bris and Mexican food , in the magazine . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; says the Hollywood star . &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s play &quot; Ani@@ ston is to be seen as a single mother of two sons .
the film runs on 25th August .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
&quot; at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger , with some colleagues , was looking for a bit of change with a ride on the beach . &quot;
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden Sport@@ pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a few minutes the horses remembered their evening , they hun@@ ted back home in the fast gal@@ lo@@ p home to the feed trou@@ ghs . &quot;
&quot; one kilometer at this pace , I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says . &quot;
and then the equ@@ est@@ rian career ended up again .
Saturday was Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer ever - 101 tournament victories - again close to horses .
&quot; he had his family run over the plant of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he did not shoot himself for photo purposes . &quot;
&quot; long was the first time in Aachen , and thus also with the CH@@ IO . &quot;
the reason was quite convincing .
the German Spor@@ ts@@ aid handed over to the man from An@@ hausen in the context of a small gala the Golden Sport pyramid .
there is no lack of awards for the symp@@ a@@ thetic athlete .
&quot; Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silver Lor@@ ry leaf , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ... &quot;
even the Queen of Britain already ad@@ ored him .
the 18th winner of the sports pyramid is long .
&quot; in Aachen , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; this award means to me a lot , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; because she is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment . &quot;
&quot; for decades , Lan@@ ger has been fo@@ stering new offspring . &quot;
&quot; and so he continued the prize money of 25,000 euros . &quot;
&quot; with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ time US master winner was recorded on Saturday in the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame des deutschen Sports . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the winners include the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ engen , the fen@@ ders Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the rider Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the ski@@ pper Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ ously the hand@@ ball Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich . &quot;
many of these sports cars came to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company went to the Spring@@ sta@@ dion , where the lava prize ran . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and Tr@@ umps Economic Policy in Com@@ par@@ ison : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
&quot; not one thing is the two US presidential candidates , however , in tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue . &quot;
&quot; the difference in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton is a fundamental , rather philosophical difference . &quot;
of the role of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warn that the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulation . &quot;
&quot; Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death , he says . &quot;
&quot; he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , says Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; he will massi@@ vely return regulations , and he will be strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , says : the state has to fulfil certain tasks ; it has to open dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money . &quot;
&quot; that is why taxes for the rich would increase , they say . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in the need to invest , Tr@@ ump and Clinton say almost word @-@ like . &quot;
the democratic candidate never announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in the infrastructure are classic democratic politics and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical wing of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
&quot; so on Tr@@ ump , there could still be party @-@ internal discussions . &quot;
the differences in energy and climate policy are more evident .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and drive coal mining again in the US .
&quot; oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas , which aims to termin@@ ate the Paris climate protection agreement . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , wants to extend the renewable energies with its investment program : &quot; a country will become the super@@ power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be . &quot;
&quot; however , not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other . &quot;
&quot; T@@ PP , the tran@@ spa@@ zi@@ lian trade agreement , do not want to sign both . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both of them do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade , but rather to better protect American jobs . &quot;
&quot; they should also be paid better , called Clinton . &quot;
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a famine .
he wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must rise , then he says he must not be changed . &quot;
but the large discussion of the coming months would probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
&quot; on the one hand , Tr@@ ump , who wants to relieve the economy and citizens , is to boost growth . &quot;
his critics believe that the budget deficit would only be greater .
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton , who wants at least from the rich , wants to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution either . &quot;
escape : &quot; every escaped woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence is almost everyday life for women who are fle@@ eing alone .
&quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed . &quot;
a house provides shelter .
four women sit in a large kitchen .
&quot; each one has a baby , which is at most one year old . &quot;
one has put her little son in her arms .
he looks curi@@ ously in the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es at the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is observed .
she s@@ miles and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you talk with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; she is a division manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a sponsor for social welfare services in Bavaria , and deals with the issue of women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are f@@ owl .
&quot; in the Munich North , they live in one of the few decentr@@ alised accommodations for single @-@ minded women and their children in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs opened the facility together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Women &apos;s Help . &quot;
&quot; recently , it was officially opened . &quot;
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - not as visitors .
the exception is a guard at the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has had experiences on her escape with sexual violence , &quot; B@@ ahr says . &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they threaten torture or death , or because their families send them as hope carriers to Europe , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; in women , other reasons out@@ weigh the flight : &quot; many steal away secretly because they see no other way out . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in their homeland they have done experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , hon@@ ors , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
this is what drives them away .
&quot; on the run , that goes on . &quot;
&quot; for example , that smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers for a bottle of water demand a sexual act is not r@@ arity , &quot; B@@ ahr says . &quot;
and the women are alone ; they are not protected by their families .
&quot; who thinks that the end , as soon as they arrive in Germany , ir@@ re , tells B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; here too , single @-@ standing women in refugee camps are often regarded as inferior and at worst ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; this means that about 90 percent of women living in the accommodation in the north of Munich are trau@@ mati@@ zed , they appreciate . &quot;
&quot; some of the children are certainly not born voluntarily . &quot;
many women are used to say nothing .
&quot; or they don &apos;t dare to talk openly about the experience , because the shame is too big . &quot;
&quot; since they often don &apos;t know how to help , more accommodation needs only for them , calls B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees . &quot;
&quot; on the question of whether they knew about a similar project as in Munich in their sphere of responsibility , some answer with no . &quot;
&quot; in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia , for example , there are not so many accommodations in the Govern@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; in Schw@@ aben alone , escaped women are not accommod@@ ated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokesman of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Middle Fran@@ con@@ ia , there are floors in some community shel@@ ters or their own houses only for single women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women . &quot;
the Committee &quot; Rights of Women and Gender E@@ quality &quot; in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommod@@ ated separately from men .
&quot; in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women are accommod@@ ated separately . &quot;
&quot; if privacy is missing or if men and women are accommod@@ ated together , it may - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot;
&quot; above all , the wash@@ rooms should be separated and readily accessible to women , is in the study . &quot;
&quot; as the women feel this need for protection , one can read the rush that is available to the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since we have spoken about that there is , we have a long waiting list , &quot; B@@ ahr says . &quot;
you could easily make a second house .
assistance doctors argue : demands for new work combat measures
assistant doctors have called upon their union to approve new work campaign measures in their dispute with regard to a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has called for its entire Council to approve more work @-@ fighting measures from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that ministers had been acc@@ using ministers to deal with the concerns about the contract .
&quot; in July , assistance doctors and medical students voted on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BM@@ A . &quot;
he was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government was &quot; persist@@ ently quiet &quot; to problems , leading to the refusal of the treaty . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; In view of this , the J@@ DC Board has agreed to fully reject the proposed new contract and call for official new negotiations on all your concerns . &quot;
&quot; as an answer to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board today announced a formal application for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to approve a running programme of escal@@ ating work combat measures that begin at the beginning of September . &quot;
&quot; the disputes led to the fact that assistance doctors fought six times this year , the first total out@@ ages in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
the head of the BM@@ A assistance doctors Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana came back after the election for the rejection of the agreed contract terms recommended by the BM@@ A .
&quot; he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings , which took place before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 assistant doctors and medical students , that the contract was beneficial and should be accepted . &quot;
&quot; after the vote , the Minister of Health , Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t , said that the Treaty for Doc@@ tors in England would be enforced . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and to proclaim an official end to the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions .
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counter@@ parts in the gil@@ ded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace , I can &apos;t resist the impression that Ankara is most interested in this reconciliation . &quot;
&quot; there was a hand@@ shake , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin &apos;s smile seemed narrow , and he hardly radi@@ ated heat , even for his restra@@ ined relations . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ yi@@ p Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , spoke repeatedly of his &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report full five times . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
&quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve . &quot;
&quot; the next day , a newspaper describing that Erdo@@ gan had beha@@ ved like never would have happened . &quot;
to me his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite .
&quot; but one of Putin &apos;s bright , sustainable cows showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had nothing to forget . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory words : the dow@@ ning of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was fur@@ ious .
Putin stated and accused Ankara to fall back to Russia .
the offen@@ se was even bigger as it was done by a supposed friend .
re@@ building the c@@ ous@@ ins will be difficult if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months , the state @-@ controlled media led a violent and un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
suddenly it seemed as if the Turks would blame for everything .
&quot; most serious were the accus@@ ations from senior officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in the areas of Syria , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he has denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
&quot; finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the ap@@ ology from President Erdo@@ gan , which he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia was able to book a kind of victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ ase@@ fire are clearly obvious . &quot;
&quot; first of all , Erdo@@ gan needs all the friends he can get after spending his last month in a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat . &quot;
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him .
but there are also economic motives .
&quot; Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year . &quot;
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when flights are resum@@ ed . &quot;
they count on a late season rush to the Mediterranean .
&quot; this week , the state television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed to be allowed . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti put it as follows : &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara fur@@ i@@ ously anger@@ ed the West as it looked at its reaction to the attempt to take power as a weak response .
&quot; to this end , the persistent res@@ ent@@ ment on the s@@ nail @-@ emp@@ o of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is eager to benefit from the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West . &quot;
the Russian head of state won a bonus for Ankara with certainty that after the attempted coup d &apos;@@ é@@ tat he demanded support for the elected state organs .
&quot; this is a matter of course for Moscow , a matter of course , which even has a deep fear of regime change . &quot;
&quot; the summit in this splendid palace by the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to present an &quot; &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; to me as an analy@@ st once described an &quot; &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; : two countries that feel ill @-@ treated by the West and are now f@@ ading . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave itself the role of peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides . &quot;
&quot; it could be significant that after almost three hours of first talks , both pres@@ idents at the press conference said they hadn &apos;t even touched the issue . &quot;
&quot; the president of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphasize it . &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ ti@@ lities - and in view of the potential for a complete disaster , when NATO member Turkey fired the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders talk at least once again . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
&quot; according to the Bank &apos;s Chief Executive Officer , the R@@ BS brand will only be reduced to a back office role . &quot;
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was associated with the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
&quot; since then , the Bank has dist@@ anced itself since it had to be almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago . &quot;
&quot; in this time , trademark strate@@ gi@@ sts &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other end @-@ consumer financial stamps . &quot;
&quot; they supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ship , from Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray . &quot;
but now she decided to focus on more national brands .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland but will not be initi@@ alized .
&quot; in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ central headquarters and the stock exchange record to Nat@@ West will change . &quot;
the brand Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are other smaller brands for private customer business that will get more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
&quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B will become our investor &apos;s brand as well as to the brand under which our employees will be employed , as we now become more of a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; when the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand . &quot;
&quot; I say now that we do not pursue global goals , but local goals . &quot;
each of these brands will stand in their own communities for something completely different and our employees will work among these brands with the customers .
R@@ BS has already said that it will no longer carry out his Six Nations sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in his sports sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; it is time for us to develop into the bank of the brands , because how do we focus inside ( we have asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the Chief Executive Officer . &quot;
three years ago it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal when we said that we would be a great bank for our customers and had launched these brands .
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think that you will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can launch these trademarks again , so I think that the time has come . &quot;

the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market on Friday .
&quot; he bet on Pre@@ dile@@ ction , which is trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local rac@@ et@@ rack with his second win of the night a milestone . &quot;
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey , reaching the milestone in the flat race . &quot;
&quot; he follows Sir Gordon Ri@@ chards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; the three @-@ time winner of D@@ ett@@ ori , who was in front of G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot;
I &apos;m very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
&quot; it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very humble .
D@@ ett@@ ori picks up the jubil@@ ation when he fet@@ ches victory on Pre@@ dile@@ ction
&quot; two Jo@@ ck@@ eys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record @-@ breaking career . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career paths &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of Moder@@ nis@@ m and it &apos;s no surprise that he reached this milestone reached only a few before him .
&quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tactical intel@@ lect , which differs from the others in the weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma thrilled fans for years for this sport . &quot;
&quot; I told Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som , that he had already gotten 6,000 gains if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and Grand @-@ Tournam@@ ent jo@@ ckey ! &quot;
Frank@@ ie has already cut over 30 years of winner in the UK which is great .
&quot; he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the fi@@ gu@@ re@@ head of the British flat race for two decades . &quot;
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
&quot; a number of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; in As@@ cot in 1996 , but he also survived a plane crash and received a prohibition of drugs . &quot;
&quot; three years ago , he had difficulties when he returned from his six month lock , but he showed an impressive character to def@@ y his two @-@ fl@@ utes and to return to his best form . &quot;
and he is not yet at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue in competitions up to his minimum of five years .
Russia &apos;s Putin firing staff of staff Sergei Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed his Chief of Staff Sergei Ivan@@ ov .
&quot; for many years , IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of Putin &apos;s closest circle of trust . &quot;
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed the Special Repres@@ entative for Environmental and Transport Affairs .
&quot; in a statement by the Krem@@ lin , it is said that without stating reasons , Putin ordered the release of Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ a@@ ino , who has been a representative since 2012 , has been appointed his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ a@@ ino , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; born in 1972 in the Est@@ onian capital Tall@@ inn , he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , it is called ( in Russian ) that he was later Chief of the Administration and Chief of Staff of the Government . &quot;
&quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
I think it &apos;s the main task of the government to support your work as head of state with regard to bills of law and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin informed the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov was asked to leave his post and recommend V@@ a@@ ino as his successor .
are smiling faces convincing ?
this step has made Moscow en@@ ig@@ matic .
&quot; Sergei Ivan@@ ov , for a long time , was one of Vladimir Putin &apos;s closest confi@@ d@@ ants and works like him for the Soviet intelligence service , the K@@ GB . &quot;
&quot; as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff res@@ ig@@ ns at his own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the smile for the cameras , only a few are convinced , especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
so is the consequence of a sort of power struggle ?
nobody knows this right now .
&quot; but the official claim - that a man who once tou@@ red as a potential president , wants to lead the Russian environmental policy once more - pushed to great scep@@ ticism . &quot;
&quot; in his remarks to Putin quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s true that I asked you at the beginning of 2012 in a conversation , to me this very complicated post - you could almost say - tru@@ sting posts for four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration for four years and eight months . &quot;
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V accepted the post in December 2011 .
before that he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of the State Security Service K@@ GB .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was Chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy . &quot;
&quot; when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he trusted most . &quot;
&quot; once it was assumed that after Putin &apos;s second term , Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia , as a third term of office had viol@@ ated Putin &apos;s constitution . &quot;
&quot; but this post was taken by another , close ally to Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot;

ri@@ dd@@ les for fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
an inhabit@@ ant of Ban@@ ff called for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin Ba@@ in thinks that the 75 fish could deal with sand beaches that were sp@@ un off by a fountain .
&quot; Mr. Ba@@ in , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published on Per@@ is@@ cope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could throw some light on the appearance of the two inches long fishes . &quot;
crossing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the northern deck of Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings to the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; &quot; cover b@@ lower &quot; , &quot; which approach each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons . &quot;
&quot; it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 incl@@ ine cables . &quot;
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economy Keith Brown made a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; we are all witnesses of an engineering skill of a truly epic measure in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a tricky activity requiring extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit . &quot;
&quot; all in all , nearly 79 % of the total bridge deck is at its place and the last section of the deck gets a g@@ ong@@ g for the deck in Ros@@ y@@ th , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , Project Manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure is a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot;
&quot; in this fantastic project , the closure is a trend @-@ setting high @-@ rise and civil engineering . &quot;
&quot; after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the Nord@@ tur@@ m@@ deck , which is located in the expansion , we had to close the still existing gap on the north or east side . &quot;
this was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
&quot; massive , since the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 2@@ 22 metres long , about 6,000 tons , and had to be pulled upwards at an incl@@ ine of about 3 % . &quot;
&quot; because the toler@@ ances on which the team were working , they were tiny - on each side they ru@@ d@@ led only a few milli@@ meters . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , everything went very well . &quot;
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; luck still alive &quot;
three men are lucky to be alive after they were thrown off by their fishing boat at Angl@@ es@@ ey .
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station struck on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alert after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty swimming in safety while their boat moved on from their own strength .
&quot; we saw how the boat turned around and posed us the worst , &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds have already blown the boat out of its reach until we left it , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found hanging on a Bo@@ je hanging without a life@@ jacket . &quot;
they all came aboard the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station .
&quot; Mr Jones said , &quot; &quot; The three men who were thrown into the water have fortunately remained un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot;
&quot; the boat engine had a stop@@ over , but the boat was released from the person who ste@@ ered the boat . &quot;
someone is w@@ aking up today about these men .
seriously injured - man pun@@ ishes his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and seriously injured .
&quot; as the police said yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the keys to the apartment to pick up his personal things . &quot;
&quot; instead , the alcohol off@@ ender cut the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; when she came into the apartment , he stab@@ bed her twice . &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured by the hand and on the body .
the police were able to arrest the perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; during the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothing of his ex @-@ girlfriend , he called his mother . &quot;
this then al@@ er@@ ted his sister .
&quot; together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother . &quot;
but she could not move it to leave the apartment .
that is why she went out of the house with her partner .
on the street they met the husband &apos;s ex @-@ wife .
&quot; when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old pushed his sister aside and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
who is building Braunschweig cheap apartments ?
the SPD and the Gre@@ ens mean : investors should be taken into duty much more strongly in the future .
how do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments over the next few years ?
the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; housing concept &quot; at the next meeting .
but dispute is programmed .
first and foremost it is about the question : who should build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; s &amp; D Group president Christoph Brat@@ mann believes : &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : those who want to build urban areas will have to exhibit 20 percent of all apartments as social housing in future . &quot;
&quot; the favorable apartments , however , can also arise in the continu@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; the main point in the town hall is , however , Brat@@ mann : &quot; how can you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors to build on such areas at least 10 percent , but as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing as possible . &quot;
&quot; a new urban housing development programme , which will cost millions and still needs to be financed , should provide incentives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; there is no agreement between the fac@@ tions at the moment . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as little as possible .
the left wants to impose tough@@ er constraints on investors .
&quot; regardless of this , viol@@ a , a tigh@@ tening of the situation is on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; if the concept of action is implemented , it will take care of additional tasks in the building management . &quot;
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers .
&quot; but the programme is not complete : the 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot;
but how do you compare the loss of more around 1300 beneficial apartments whose funding will exp@@ ire in the next few years ?
&quot; by 2020 , there will be 500 apartments . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent this , the planning policy spokesperson Nicole Palm should be bought from the city now . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would have to be thought to bring back apartments back into the price bond . &quot;
this is possible in West@@ stadt .
&quot; at one stroke , the problem could be solved . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the year , Fri@@ sts will be running in West@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; about 1800 apartments , one could get back to the price binding for cheap apartments . &quot;
only : this does not mean the owners who do not have housing associations .
&quot; because the number of social housing in the western city is dramatically increased , the goal of the so @-@ called mix @-@ up will be removed . &quot;
there should be no more concentration of socially dis@@ advant@@ aged in just a few districts .
the Gre@@ ens reck@@ on that there will still be movement in the discussion .
&quot; Mr Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke said : &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U must be in the boat for a broad majority . &quot;
I concentrated on more construction sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise can not yet be found .
&quot; Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off &quot;
it is fascinating to watch how the world is changing .
&quot; the fact that teenagers and children don &apos;t go outside to play anymore , but rather prefer to spend their free time playing on screens has been compla@@ ined by many in the last decade . &quot;
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
&quot; the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then on video games and last on smartphones . &quot;
so it &apos;s great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive .
&quot; of course I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters created for the video games in the 199@@ 0@@ ies ( later created a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) . &quot;
&quot; like many pop culture phenomena , the interest in the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand declined somewhat at the beginning of July . &quot;
market launch in other countries has been postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that over@@ bur@@ dened the servers .
&quot; within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than T@@ inder and almost as many as Twitter . &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , the players go out with their smartphones outside and search for Pok@@ é@@ mons , which are followed by a GPS and once they were found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game , when she was younger , joined the tram and jumped for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , the game resulted in a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person withdraw@@ s every day . &quot;
&quot; Cardi@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , which follows 35@@ ,000 users , announced the Washington Post recently that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of follow @-@ up people , who exercise every day 30 minutes , jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
the company doesn &apos;t know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it merely looks the raw data to increase performance .
&quot; many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to get &quot; &quot; 30 minutes of time &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; come from the sofa &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; be active every day &quot; , &quot; because many public messages for health are boring and coming from people who look miserable . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ valued . &quot;
&quot; those who regularly exercise sports , reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression . &quot;
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here . &quot;
but the wonder@@ full thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
&quot; thus three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun . &quot;
some people even close new friend@@ ships .
&quot; as always , there are gru@@ es@@ ome game spo@@ ons that always have to complain about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could run against a door . &quot;
what is it supposed to do ?
a breakthrough occurred .
&quot; even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit were already able to track down our activity earlier , they didn &apos;t give us the reason to play sports as it does this game . &quot;
the new will lose its appeal and the use will be recre@@ ated with time .
&quot; however , due to poker &apos;s success , there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with the active in the real world and help many people in hunting to be more active , f@@ itter and healthier . &quot;

Sim@@ one Bil@@ es creates gold in women &apos;s ur@@ ns
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Sim@@ one Bil@@ es is immune to all this .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ lessly on the beam .
breath@@ tak@@ ingly on the floor .
brilliant on the whole line .
and now finally Olympic Champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gym@@ n@@ ast ki@@ cked off on Thursday for the multi @-@ competition title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
their overall result of 6@@ 2.@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team mate A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina .
&quot; the Americans Sim@@ one Bil@@ es tur@@ nt on the floating beam during the individual multi@@ campaign of women during the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ o is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osexual American who wins a multi @-@ competition title , and in total the fifth , while holding her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all . &quot;
she burst into tears when her end result was shown and her long journey at that moment found an end .
&quot; this achievement puts them in the same league as unique athletes , such as Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights : &quot;
&quot; it has won the last three years of its sport , 15 world championship med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic Champion of 1984 said she is &quot; the best gym@@ n@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
&quot; she was expecting a final exam in Brazil , a competition not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be regarded as disappointment . &quot;
&quot; the Americans Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the individual multi@@ campaign of women during the 2016 Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ berry took the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as an ex@@ clamation mark on the farewell party of the team coordinator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i retired at the farewell party . &quot;
&quot; although it insisted , while its long way to the top , never planned the future , this is not really true . &quot;
&quot; part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is att@@ un@@ ed to Latin American music , which would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio . &quot;
this is no coincidence .
&quot; this girl , who was adopted by her grand@@ parents as a little child and discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school flight in the gym@@ nasi@@ um , was trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2013 , it has not lost any competition competition , a series of victories that will last as long as it wishes . &quot;
&quot; even if Mu@@ staf@@ ina was slightly led by two turns , the picture was dec@@ ep@@ tive . &quot;
floating beams and floor plans - in which Bil@@ es holds the title of the world - was l@@ ur@@ king .
&quot; she recovered again with 15.@@ 4@@ 33 on the floating beam - and , with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor , she added another . &quot;
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her gently as she expected her en@@ sign - a pure form of form@@ ality - and tears poured out bril@@ li@@ antly red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her collection book . &quot;
&quot; the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was ven@@ ge@@ ance for the last time four years ago , when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal went to Mu@@ staf@@ ina in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain , which is called &quot; &quot; Grand@@ ma &quot; &quot; by the Americans , had a lead . &quot;
&quot; after their ground exercise , she cast down kis@@ ses to the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback that sometimes appeared du@@ bi@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; as far as Bil@@ es is concerned , the rapidly spreading T@@ we@@ et of 19 @-@ year @-@ olds has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week : &quot;
police : 3 victims shot in mass mur@@ der@@ ers when listening to music in the car
&quot; according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were killed , who died in one of the dead@@ liest attacks for a decade in the first serial killer of Phoenix , while they chat@@ ted in the car and heard music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Roch@@ elle Liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a fire@@ arm while he was standing on the passenger side of the car , and then fled with another vehicle , is to be read in the report . &quot;
&quot; the police said that the thre@@ ef@@ old murder does not seem to have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y , since the attack@@ er did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who owned one of the adult victims . &quot;
the police spokesman of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether they were connected to four previous attacks .
&quot; in total , seven people were killed in nine attacks in h@@ is@@ panic residential neighbor@@ hoods in nine attacks and two others were injured . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; shares Howard der K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is believed that the susp@@ ects used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Ca@@ dil@@ lac or Lincol@@ n . &quot;
investig@@ ators refused to disclose the evidence they led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
&quot; El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to their injuries and died later . &quot;
&quot; liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site . &quot;
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
&quot; the authorities also published a police report about the shooting , which was aimed at an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the work of serial killer . &quot;
investig@@ ators found cartridge shells and secured a ball out of the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with a micro@@ cephal@@ ia : &quot; it gets better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ olds , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but like the f@@ ew@@ est of his contem@@ por@@ aries , Ed@@ mund has micro@@ cephal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; when he first came home , my first thought was , I couldn &apos;t do that . &quot;
I don &apos;t manage that .
I did not let myself go .
&quot; what is not right at all -- of course , one has embark@@ ed on it , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
your husband Vincent and her have been told that Ed@@ mund will never know them and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they suggested to institution@@ alize him .
&quot; my first answer was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot;
Ed@@ mund can run with help of a housing aid .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor craw@@ l until his third year of life and he still cannot speak .
but it is slow to progress .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Ed@@ mund has conceived for &quot; Please sing me something . &quot;
&quot; we bring him a sign language , &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News told . &quot;
but it is not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund has invented a few characters alone .
&quot; micro@@ cephal@@ y has a variety of causes : genetic as with Ed@@ mund , as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the ci@@ ca@@ virus during pregnancy . &quot;
the symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the infected virus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t know .
&quot; I haven &apos;t asked for the forecast for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect someone to really tell me . &quot;
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the ci@@ ca@@ virus .
it is getting better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
&quot; heavy ra@@ ins , floo@@ ding gives rise to ba@@ il@@ outs in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi &quot;
heavy rainf@@ alls and large floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call the emergency stand on Friday .
&quot; numerous rivers in the southeast of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi flooded their shores and threatened with large floo@@ ding after extreme rainf@@ alls , reported the National Weather Service . &quot;
the Gover@@ nor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards informed that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and are already on the move to the affected communities .
&quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokesman for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , announced that the requests for high @-@ water vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags increased . &quot;
&quot; Ste@@ ele said that alone , the community of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa would have demanded tens of thousands of sand@@ bags . &quot;
a flood warning system is used for large parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana until Saturday .
the weather forecast announced that in this area additional 3 to 5 inches could fall in rain .
&quot; in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama , a flood warning system was used on Friday , while it was still ra@@ ining in the mobile area . &quot;
&quot; the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , which are both located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will probably reach record levels over the weekend . &quot;
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
&quot; he also said that a downstream floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , as these rivers flow slowly into the Lake Mau@@ ret@@ as via the tro@@ dden rivers . &quot;
&quot; the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , already reached the highest level at 09.@@ 00 on Friday , which was ever recorded . &quot;
rescue teams still shr@@ ank people from floo@@ ding water in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the Sou@@ thwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
&quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were rescu@@ ed by Glo@@ ster on Friday . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house , grew strongly overnight . &quot;
he said that another step@@ son who lives nearby would have warned him .
&quot; we woke up and the water flow@@ ed and flo@@ cked in , &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot;
it reached my waist .
&quot; his wife told Hans@@ ford that in the 48 years she lived there , she never saw such a high level of the river . &quot;
Hans@@ ford said he and his family members would have all disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that emergency hel@@ pers would have saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they stayed until Friday . &quot;
&quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the floo@@ ding had &quot; &quot; spread rapidly &quot; , &quot; as there were still heavy rainf@@ alls and that the authorities considered evacu@@ ation instructions . &quot;
&quot; according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer reported near Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches rain . &quot;
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the soil was completely su@@ cked by the rainf@@ alls since Wednesday .
the authorities indicated that heavy rainf@@ alls and floo@@ ding floods caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa par@@ ish and school failure in five school districts .
the C@@ BS affiliate WW@@ L reported that an ordin@@ ate in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa took over 200 flooded houses .
&quot; the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated in two churches , both flooded now . &quot;
&quot; the leader of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had rescu@@ ed 72 people and seven domestic animals , which were r@@ ins@@ ed by floods . &quot;
&quot; in the towns of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to accommodate the evacu@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the water starts to go back , they will be able to return to their homes , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the town of Ham@@ mond of the commun@@ e of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozen roads were closed down due to the high water and sand@@ bags were provided for the residents , hoping to keep the water from their houses and shops . &quot;
&quot; the last big flood we had was in March , &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rush of the city administration . &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
&quot; in Miss@@ issi@@ pp , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it was ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast . &quot;
&quot; according to his statements , a handful of houses were reported to be in@@ und@@ ated on Thursday , but on Friday no reports were reported . &quot;
&quot; Keith T@@ own@@ son , Manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years . &quot;
&quot; I have seen water in places where I never saw it before , &quot; said T@@ own@@ son , &quot; and it still comes . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; pier@@ ced by bul@@ lets , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia &quot;
&quot; the police said that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a 6 year old child was shot . &quot;
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; the grand@@ parents stated that Brown suffered several shot injuries , including in the end leg , leg , arm and abdom@@ en , but that he was in the hospital when he was transported to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; he has done a lot , his small body was saved by bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; said his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the station . &quot;
I can &apos;t believe it .
the boy &apos;s condition was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family told the station that he is expected to recover .
he should have begun the first class in a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in a stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
&quot; the boy was found on the front seat of a car with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is in a critical state , found shot , reports the transmitter . &quot;
&quot; the other two victims were not in the car , and the police investigated whether one of the injured men could be the offen@@ ders . &quot;
investig@@ ators told C@@ BS Philadelphia that it seems to have come to a cross@@ fire between several arch@@ ers .
&quot; cartridge shells for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were traced back to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , approached the crime scene . &quot;
it seems that this is clearly a continuing struggle .
&quot; on the street , on both sides of the walk@@ way , there were tubes . &quot;
&quot; it seems that there are several armed fighters who have been involved very actively , &quot; said police ra@@ pper Anthony G@@ inal@@ di of the police in Philadelphia . &quot;
several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area .
&quot; there was no arrest , and the police are currently investigating the surveillance video . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , another 6 @-@ year old girl was hit by a cri@@ cket at her arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane . &quot;
she re@@ covers and the police are still searching for a suspect .
&quot; why we need Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot;
that is what I present under the Women &apos;s Olympic Cup in the Tur@@ ns and that for more than one reason .
&quot; first , I &apos;ve been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; and secondly : this team has three gym@@ na@@ sts , Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , inspiring for many young girls of other skin color . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jewish is and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , the Catho@@ lics , rounds off , makes everyone proud . &quot;
this team finally reflects the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and His@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
&quot; in the last four years , the number one among female gym@@ na@@ sts was an Af@@ ro @-@ American woman . &quot;
last year Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
that shows strength .
&quot; at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America che@@ ered . &quot;
&quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion in Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they delivered unexpected , yet master@@ ly gy@@ n@@ astic routines . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Sim@@ one became the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osexual American woman who won gold in an individual multi @-@ campaign event for women . &quot;
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
&quot; we experience the top of this sport , but they don &apos;t look like sports classes throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all beat the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to put it into the olymp@@ ic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; Last Five , &quot; because the next Olympic team will only have four female gym@@ na@@ sts in the team . &quot;
&quot; but the reality is that Tur@@ ns are a more expensive sport and Tur@@ ner primarily in private sports clubs , which are maintained by parents who are responsible for training , training , travel , clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their gym@@ na@@ sts and families ) . &quot;
the majority of these clubs are in wealthy suburbs which can support the business .
&quot; in these clubs , the Tur@@ ner will receive their entire training and that is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both trained their athletes , since they started with the gymnas@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; we have to give the churches au@@ n countless , young girls who are inspired by Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a more affordable and easily accessible gym workout . &quot;
I founded my gymnas@@ tics foundation for 20 years .
&quot; during my events , we have offered free and affordable gymnas@@ tics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban young people ( mainly black and h@@ is@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners . &quot;
&quot; in September we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality gymnas@@ tics , which deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport . &quot;
&quot; gymnas@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health as well as for school and professional success .
&quot; it is the inspiration of this team , who bring thousands of young girls to interest in the gymnas@@ tics and that &apos;s great . &quot;
&quot; it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls . &quot;
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; thanks Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this genuine presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by holding the Olympic Team gol@@ ds and thank you so many young girls with different backgrounds motivated to get their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
assistance doctors want to organise further strikes after having rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal
&quot; the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37@@ ,000 assistance doctors voted against him . &quot;
&quot; in July , Hun@@ t had revealed plans to introduce the treaty , and said that the N@@ HS would be in a &quot; &quot; no land &quot; &quot; and any further delay would be harmful to the employees and patients . &quot;
&quot; the first assistance doctors are to receive a new contract , which includes changes to night and weekend packages to improve the care of times and times . &quot;
&quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the BM@@ A Committee for Assistance physicians announced last night in a message : &quot; &quot; assistance doctors have still raised serious concerns on the proposed contract , in particular that it will heat up the current occupation crisis and it will be used to treat all physicians appropriately . &quot;
&quot; with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress has to be made and the time runs out . &quot;
efforts on the part of the Federal Ministry for resol@@ ving disputes caused by talks have appe@@ aled to the government for reluct@@ ance to participate and sometimes de@@ af@@ ening to de@@ af@@ ening silence .
&quot; this happened to a promise made by Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t just last month , that his door would always be open . &quot;
Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t now needs to act now to lift the lift and address the concerns of the assistance doctors .
&quot; should he not do so , the assistance doctors have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further work in action . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a postpon@@ ement of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved to cover doctors on the strip chain . &quot;
the ministers hoped to finish the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the BM@@ A wants a better week of the week for the 5@@ 4.000 assistance doctors , who will be subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of the N@@ HS Group , called on the assistance doctors to stop the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; work combat measures do not achieve anything that is little , but already burden over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare patients , car@@ ers and their families only worry , need and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
&quot; over the last two months , we talked to the committee of assistance doctors and responded positively to the concerns regarding the guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ings with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries . &quot;
&quot; employers hoped that continued positive engagement on other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training courses , training courses , mutual recognition of the curriculum , continuing education and the Ministry of Health regarding the compliance with the agreements with the BM@@ A in November , February and May . &quot;
the £ 2 per day drug that can reduce heart attack risk
thousands of heart attacks will benefit from a £ 2 per day medication after the authorities have been advised to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti @-@ inflammatory drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
&quot; the medicine is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack . &quot;
N@@ ICE &apos;s regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
N@@ ICE &apos;s regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; about 140@@ ,000 people suffer from a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer from another heart attack or stroke . &quot;
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls .
&quot; if the floor@@ covering is breaking apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots that c@@ logged the flow of blood to the heart , causing a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; when the blood cl@@ ots trigger , it can flow through the blood stream and c@@ logging the flow of blood to the brain , causing a stroke . &quot;
persons who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another .
&quot; T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more likely . &quot;
&quot; the draft of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily dose of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Technology Assessment Centre said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons who have suffered a heart attack , have another heart attack or stroke , often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack .
&quot; through a preliminary recommendation of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from this . &quot;
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
the Culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness lets election fraud flour@@ ish in Muslim areas
former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ sk Rah@@ man was removed from office last year due to corruption from office .
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to the fact that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is know@@ ingly ignored as a devastating government report today .
&quot; the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les verb@@ ally attacks the police , election observers and town halls to ignore evidence of mis@@ use due to &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former Minister of Integration and Municipal Government , who is now an antagon@@ ist , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious reasons would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off shut @-@ off tapes outside of poll@@ en@@ ers to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters . &quot;
&quot; he recommends that voters should lead an identification with themselves , in order to prove their identity in elections . &quot;
&quot; at present , a vot@@ er simply needs to call his name and address . &quot;
&quot; the report proposes to apply un@@ removable ink to a person &apos;s finger when they leave their vote , in order to prevent someone to choose twice . &quot;
&quot; whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should get more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
it demands that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions from non @-@ official committees or work@@ groups .
&quot; this is not only for electoral fraud , but also to protect the municipal government from the broader corruption and finance culture that is associated with it , &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was arranged by D@@ ow@@ ning Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ let election scandal in the east of London .
&quot; last year , a special electoral court ruled that the inc@@ umbent mayor Lut@@ sk Rah@@ man should be dismissed after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry . &quot;
&quot; the Court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal way &quot; &quot; and that he would silence his critics with racism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia accus@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; Rah@@ man should &quot; &quot; have led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious obligation of Muslims to choose it . &quot;
up to 300 voices were either doubt@@ ful or the result of im@@ itation in which one person was chosen as someone else .
Sir Eric said that there were evidence throughout the country for fraud .
&quot; in particular , he vo@@ iced alarm to the frau@@ dul@@ ent choice of letters - in which older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to elect a candidate of their choice . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean out the electoral system , including guiding evidence to prove the identity &quot;
&quot; in his report it says : &quot; &quot; proving that pressure has been exer@@ ted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities , especially women and young people , in accordance with the will of the elderly , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or Banglad@@ es@@ hi background . &quot;
there were concerns that ... State institutions had unknow@@ ingly ignored such behaviour as a result of &quot; politically correct &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion .
&quot; Sir Eric addressed 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition that political activists work let@@ ter@@ dial documents in order to stop &quot; re@@ aping . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , also requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral directory to be used for immigration and social fraud purposes . &quot;
consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID .
do not use removable ink on a person &apos;s finger as soon as she left her voice to prevent someone to choose twice .
conduct systematic reviews on the nationality of a person to ensure they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications for an automatic letter code .
ban that political activists edit complete letters and envel@@ opes of let@@ ter@@ sel@@ ections .
the police have the authority to set off barriers for election stations .
a change of the law which facilit@@ ated an indictment for in@@ timi@@ dation in accordance with the 1983 Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 .
photography ban on election stations .
requirement that only English may be used in the voting stations ( except Wales ) .
&quot; intensi@@ fication of the training , in order to ensure that employees generally enforce that voters go to the poll@@ ing cabin on their own . &quot;
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case there was no criminal complaint .
&quot; the electoral court has declared Lut@@ sk Rah@@ man and his deputy for a ban on corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ suitable , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; due to a number of reasons , he was found guilty for a number of reasons - according to the high requirements of criminal proceedings . &quot;
he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; check @-@ up &quot; of the election registration departments of the town halls .
&quot; Sir Eric said , &quot; The Supreme Court in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal . &quot;
&quot; our country carries a proud legacy as the mother of parliam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation . &quot;
crazy after K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gänger and other famous doubles of Olympic athletes in Rio
&quot; this week , fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio are out of line with the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ PRE@@ VO@@ T , who proved to be the impressive double @-@ go@@ ver of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge . &quot;
&quot; but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympic Games is by far not the only athletic athlete , who has its own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not if one is allowed to believe the social media . &quot;
&quot; in honor of the Rio Olympics and all the famous faces running on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympic games that show more than just a certain simil@@ arity to Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; the hunter and the wolf : team member of the US team in ar@@ cher@@ y Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , has been compared to Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood . &quot;
&quot; apart from K@@ ates &apos;s double @-@ end rider on the racing track , many people on the internet pointed out how a certain arc of the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio could be . &quot;
&quot; the team member of the US team in ar@@ cher@@ y Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison caused a rush on Twitter , after pictures on which he sees the wolf of Wall Street Star secretly similar . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he had already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I myself don &apos;t see any resem@@ b@@ lance , with the exception of facial hair , &quot; Bra@@ dy announced the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a good looking guy , so I take it as a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ jum@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
&quot; the Russian gym@@ n@@ ast Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina with her big , expressive eyes is said to be a double @-@ runner for the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an . &quot;
&quot; and in the swimming pool , the South African Swi@@ mmer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with the G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for many years . &quot;
a course higher : this user believes Nathan is the &quot; athletic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption act@@ ress
&quot; another ongoing comparison was drawn between tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similar heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips . &quot;
&quot; the Russian silver medal at Yu@@ lia E@@ fi@@ mov@@ a shows more than just the sun @-@ t@@ anned skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian was att@@ ested by fans to resemble an &quot; athletic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face and eyes &quot;
not the only thing : a Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the simil@@ arities
&quot; theory in the room : according to this user , there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple . &quot;
a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical .
&quot; in fact , the US soccer star Hope Solo and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face and eyes . &quot;
&quot; other popular compar@@ isons included Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney and the gold medal winner in Tur@@ ns Gab@@ by Douglas , which is similar to Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union . &quot;
C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games ap@@ ologi@@ zes for his statement that Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers &quot; died like a pig

&quot; the Canadian broad@@ caster C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers &quot; &quot; like M@@ ief &quot; &quot; went off and died as &quot; &quot; a pig died &quot; &quot; during the race . &quot;
&quot; the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was off , when at the end of the 4x@@ 200m Fre@@ estyle swimming @-@ buff@@ al@@ os to give his own opinions . &quot;
&quot; Mac@@ Donald , who had been brought to the commentary team of the C@@ BS board to give more &quot; colour , &quot; one could hear : &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in lost the connection , baby . &quot;
&quot; too excited , as low as M@@ ief , died like a pig . &quot;
thank you for this .
&quot; the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , swa@@ m the second leg of the swimming stage 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1,@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which allowed Canadi@@ ans to close the gap to China . &quot;
spectators all over Canada responded quickly after they were shocked by the sound and the language .
&quot; Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ets , &quot; H@@ as the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old s@@ wimm@@ ers from China &quot; had died like a pig ? ? ? ? &quot;
the idi@@ ot did not realize that they were still on show .
&quot; Ai Yan@@ han from China was described as described in the fin@@ als 4 x 200m self @-@ sty@@ led swimming @-@ buff@@ alo for women : &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in lost the connection , baby . &quot;
&quot; the criticism against By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter was quick and hard , with which many spoke to him . &quot;
Twitter users did not think back when they heard how un@@ sensitive By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald was
&quot; another Twitter user in Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; &quot; wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald . &quot;
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and makes us look like ra@@ cists . # ange@@ ek@@ elt .
&quot; short time later , Scott Russ@@ el , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC broadcast live for the comment by Mac@@ Donald , said : &quot; &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment on a swimming performance . &quot;
&quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wording , sorry that it happened . &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed at the end of more than 90 times with the people who answered the emer@@ gen@@ cies via Twitter
the comment colleague Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology to more than 90 other Twitter users compla@@ ining about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and gave a message .
we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast .
we ap@@ ologi@@ zed last night to our viewers on show and our folklore in the social media .
&quot; to clarify one , By@@ ron &apos;s comments related to the performance of the swi@@ mmer and not on them as a person . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate wording . By@@ ron does what he said , very sorry . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald was ap@@ olog@@ ising in the broadcast , trying to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack . &quot;
&quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the women &apos;s swimming buff@@ alo in the C@@ BC Olymp@@ ism , he said . &quot;
&quot; I focused on the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers , and not on them as a person . &quot;
&quot; of course , no dis@@ regard was intended and I am very sorry . &quot;
Pri@@ mark shop@@ pers about women who sham@@ elessly under@@ wear under@@ wear in the middle of business
&quot; the buyers didn &apos;t know where to go , when a woman pulled out her clothes in the middle of a pri@@ mer to try out trousers . &quot;
&quot; to wor@@ sen the situation , she pat@@ ter@@ ned how she looked at it , pulled her out and put her back on the shelf . &quot;
she continued to browse and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a business at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark shop at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone where the woman tried the under@@ pants before she put it back into the shelf
&quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in the business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear she went back and left the business without buying anything . &quot;
she said : &quot; people couldn &apos;t believe what they saw .
&quot; standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the delivery , pulled out her own rhin@@ estones and pants and tried them . &quot;
&quot; she did not even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; everyone star@@ ed when she pulled out the pants that she obviously didn &apos;t like , because she put her back on the shelf . &quot;
she repeated the same thing with three more under@@ pants before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like her and went out again .
&quot; she did not seem to distur@@ b anybody observing - or thinking about the person who , under certain circumstances , would buy the under@@ pants which she had tried . &quot;
&quot; Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; how disgu@@ sting to think that someone would take shelter with home that had another person and who were not washed . &quot;
the incident took place on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; as I have received , the staff tries to pull the garments from the sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot;
I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had touched her and pulled out again and she didn &apos;t wash her .
&quot; a spokesman of Pri@@ mark said , &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that happened on Tuesday 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot;
all products coming into question were drawn from the sale .
how to protect yourself from weapon attacks with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit safer for you . &quot;
&quot; we talked to Rh@@ one Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Con@@ federation in New York , to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to rotate the sk@@ ewer for your rob@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; when you approach you from behind , you should turn around as first , so that you can see your attack@@ er and get out of the shooting line , &quot; says Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
then take the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and shoulder before you face it with your free el@@ bow .
&quot; then beat him with his knee to the bar and twist , while the attack@@ er comb@@ ats from pain , the weapon of his hands . hit him with the barrel and move backwards while holding the weapon on him . &quot;
&quot; with attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the shot , grab the gun and twist it so that the attack@@ er can &apos;t shoot . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , shift the weight to the weapon and hit the attack@@ er on the chest , then twist the weapon from its grip , before moving backwards and strai@@ gh@@ ten the weapon on it . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi does .
but remember that a rob@@ ber@@ y is the saf@@ est to hand over your money - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
traveler Ian W@@ right sch@@ ab@@ t for a guide his tongue at the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe
a British trav@@ eller under@@ lined his immune system and sau@@ sage @-@ lex of a serious test by le@@ aking some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
&quot; the moder@@ ator and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k shot his course on a euro note , a hand@@ rail at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a r@@ ins@@ ing knob of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system . &quot;
&quot; before le@@ aking any object , he used a lumin@@ ometer to show himself and us what he is going to get involved . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight . &quot;
&quot; the thought of le@@ aking the r@@ ins@@ ing knob of a pull toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact , in a kitchen sink , there are more bad bacteria . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , nothing left he le@@ aded , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resistance of his bow@@ el by traveling through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things .
&quot; from public money to railway stations to r@@ ins@@ ing kno@@ bs of toilets , the task put down his immune system under a test &quot;
&quot; in the film he said : &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot;
&quot; in the film , he got up to his reputation in any case . &quot;
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his test sample showed a lumin@@ ometer number of more than 4000 units .
&quot; compared to that , the lumin@@ ometer number of freshly washed hands is less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to lick after their lumin@@ ometer number was over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands exhibit one of less than 60 . &quot;
Mr. W@@ right and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom
&quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; this comes close to the worst I have heard in a toilet . &quot;
there is nothing more mut@@ able than that !
I will not stop here because it is disgu@@ sting here .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
&quot; the company equi@@ ps Mr W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the extraction of intestinal bacteria and the immune system . &quot;
&quot; vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ oren@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ biotics .
we performed crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended up saying &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon .
&quot; instead of just talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system . &quot;
growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had tasted some of the things I had told him , like the ec@@ clesi@@ as@@ tical Russian toilet , which is shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to lick it , and others where this was quite difficult . &quot;
I &apos;m glad that we recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film .
&quot; in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o in 2015 , 84 percent of respon@@ dents reported lac@@ tic acid bacteria , especially with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines , and 58 percent said that they at least occasionally use products containing included lac@@ tic acid bacteria . &quot;
&quot; A@@ soci@@ etal ab@@ rup@@ tly destroyed before del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; an as@@ o@@ zi@@ al family left their social housing after a del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation with a damage of £ 50,000 because they had terr@@ orized their neighbors . &quot;
&quot; T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ port@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; after being forci@@ bly removed from their property , the employees of the housing cooperative found their property in an ir@@ repar@@ able state . &quot;
&quot; the walls pointed holes , wooden plan@@ ks were torn up , garbage was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubri@@ cated to the walls . &quot;
the family was res@@ ett@@ led and it is assumed that she now lives in a private accommodation
&quot; Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for home administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said they feared that the apartment was no longer repaired . &quot;
she said : &quot; it was an absolute night@@ mare for people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live this way .
there are many things to consider since this property is thought to be considered not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is likewise .
&quot; the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inflic@@ ted was street fighting with bas@@ eball bat , in@@ timi@@ dation of residents , drug abuse , drug traffi@@ cking and excessive scre@@ ams , stri@@ kers and floods . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name stood on the lease , got an arrangement for anti @-@ social behaviour in June . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which may be torn down under certain circumstances , old tr@@ ash was found &quot;
&quot; in the estate where drugs were traffi@@ cked in the past , the wood legs were torn up &quot;
neighbors said they saw her fighting on the street and regularly called the police .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ ved her and her partner this week forci@@ bly from the property after giving them an extended deadline of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation was che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbors who said their lives were made to hell .
&quot; one said , &quot; &quot; They didn &apos;t care for anybody . &quot;
we lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; this morning , we couldn &apos;t sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to that !
&quot; now , where they are finally gone , it will be nice . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , Nei@@ gh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it would have arranged the family to cooperate with local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house , to which the police was called at regular intervals , for 20 years . &quot;
&quot; on the over@@ grown side of the community house , garbage and old toys were thrown down &quot;
&quot; he added : &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant has given an appointment to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and their family since a del@@ o@@ gi@@ zation is always the last step into consideration of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot;
&quot; this was a very difficult case , because the behaviour was extreme and their deeds had to be horrible for their neighbors . &quot;
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community who have bol@@ dly approached us and have provided us with the information . &quot;
I hope that this development will give some comfort to some neighbours and the message con@@ veys that anti @-@ social behaviour is not tolerated .
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but that they were all over 20 . &quot;
a dirty mattress that is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation on the ground .
workers of the house administration will have to sweep away garbage mountains that surround the house
&quot; in 2014 , the police carried out a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g of cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ als and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
Skel@@ don received a fine after she ple@@ aded guilty to the possession of a drug of class B in commercial law .
&quot; she claimed that the money was for a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in a car accident in 2013 . &quot;
&quot; after they were homeless , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many interior walls of the house were gra@@ ff@@ iti ham@@ mer@@ ed .
the police say they are les@@ bians that do not cling to the house rules
&quot; Angela C@@ row from the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall announced that the del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation was a clear warning to the other tenants , who do not adhere to the house rules . &quot;
&quot; this goes to those who think that they can behave without self repro@@ aches , as well as those who have been har@@ med by such behaviour , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .

&quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers who posted videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; &quot; it flew very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane fell on me .
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro were stun@@ ned when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep
&quot; the Portuguese Air Force today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast , so that it had to fly so deep that this was the only way to recognize them . &quot;
&quot; the speaker said that the jet flew a bit deeper than usual due to the bad visibility of the area , but the air force insi@@ sts that security at no time was at risk . &quot;
&quot; this summer , area fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland where four people died to death on Madeira Island . &quot;

&quot; in addition , Go@@ alie also lacks Marc @-@ Andr@@ e @-@ St@@ egen . &quot;
&quot; the German suffered a lig@@ ament in the training in the training , with which the ser@@ tion at Bar@@ ca was determined at least for the time being in favor of Claudio Bra@@ vo . &quot;
&quot; for two years , the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen compete for the status as the number one . &quot;
&quot; coach Luis En@@ rique made a clear decision in this respect and left Bra@@ vo in the League , but T@@ er St@@ egen is the leader in most of the remaining applicants . &quot;
&quot; before the first mandatory game of the new season , there are doubts with the Spanish Master about the fitness status of the team , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool at 0 : 4 . &quot;
Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. didn &apos;t really know how to convince Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. at 3 : 2 in pro@@ par@@ al@@ op@@ p against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday .

Ma Long in a separate league table tennis player
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
&quot; on Thursday , the 27 @-@ year @-@ old won his comp@@ atri@@ ot and title defender , Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5,@@ 4,@@ 4 ) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup leader won the Golden Grand S@@ lam with success at World Cup , World Cup , World @-@ Tour Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and just Olympia . &quot;
bronze went to the Japanese Ju@@ n Mi@@ zu@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it into the final game as expected and made the title among themselves .
it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would fetch the single title in the sign of the Five rings .
last non @-@ Chinese on top of the Olympics was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö legi@@ on@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
&quot; Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between the sentences and in time @-@ outs , they had no coaches with them . &quot;
they had withdrawn on the grand@@ stand and left their prot@@ ectors on their own in fair competition alone .
&quot; the Mat@@ ches , until now , I played for my country . &quot;
&quot; in the final I play for myself , &quot; Z@@ hang said fol@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; after the game , gold and silver med@@ alists with the China flag were pos@@ ing . &quot;
the match itself was unexpectedly one @-@ sided .
Ma had to fight with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first sentence .
&quot; after that , he determined the pace on the plate and left Z@@ hang from there only a total of 13 points . &quot;
the superi@@ ority of Ma did not develop the expected stirring match .
&quot; nevertheless , there were still enough breath changes to see . &quot;
Mi@@ zu@@ ani won the game for bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
&quot; in his quarter@@ fin@@ als against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the white @-@ rus@@ hing had bred a ri@@ pple injury , and afterwards he had to be satisfied with sheet metal . &quot;

Donald Tr@@ ump gives &quot; enormous problems &quot; in the election campaign
the leadership of the US re@@ public@@ ans is pla@@ gu@@ ed by massive concerns even in traditional conservative states .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now has weaknesses of his election campaign in the former Repub@@ lican High Court of U@@ tah .
&quot; a rare moment , in which the usually large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confident Mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aire has expressed something like concerns , as correspon@@ dents reported . &quot;
&quot; after he threw 16 ri@@ vals out of the race in his own Repub@@ lican camp , doubts about his success in the fight for the White House are now growing . &quot;
&quot; we have enormous problems in U@@ tah , &quot; said Tr@@ ump before evangel@@ ical Christians , who asked for support in important states like Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; guilty were false reports of his candi@@ dat@@ ure , he resum@@ ed his famous media sh@@ ook . &quot;
sha@@ w@@ ling repub@@ lican strongh@@ olds
U@@ tah is usually a secure bank for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
&quot; according to a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ USA in June , Tr@@ ump and his rival from the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , were on the same level . &quot;
&quot; other institutions see Tr@@ ump in front , but not with the distance that is common to Repub@@ lican candidates in the state . &quot;
Arizona and Georgia are also endangered as endangered .
&quot; in an interview from the CN@@ BC Senate , Tr@@ ump answered the question of how he wanted to stop the advance of Clinton : &quot; just as I did so far . &quot;
&quot; and if afterwards : this will be either successful or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot;
he does not do anything other than telling the truth .
&quot; if it is not enough for him at the end for political correctness , this is fine , said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to the press reports , the party should have threatened Tr@@ ump to paint money to support his election campaign , he should not present any better survey values . &quot;
&quot; instead of that , the candidates of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans would seize more under the arms for Congress . &quot;
Olympia : tri@@ ster fraud in dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary commission .
Ken@@ yan athletes are threatened after the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympics .
&quot; after a fraud attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic village , Kenya sent a trainer home . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee decided to immediately set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case .
&quot; a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary told the former S@@ printer and current coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic village a urine sample under the name of the 800 meter runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich . &quot;
this was reported to the team leadership of Kenya by the dop@@ ing controllers .
&quot; the IA@@ AF world association has requested the IO@@ C for information about the case in order to establish its own investigations , an IA@@ AF @-@ speaker shared . &quot;
&quot; depending on the results of the investigation and subsequent measures taken by the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; he said in an IA@@ AF statement . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and turned out to be F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , the rehear@@ sal and signed , &quot; explained K@@ eni@@ as boss de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot;
he was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete who stood on the list for training controls of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich was over 800 meters in Beijing in 2015 .
&quot; four days before , the Ken@@ yan track leader Michael Rot@@ ich had been deduc@@ ted from the Rio Games . &quot;
he should have informed athletes of his country about upcoming dop@@ ing tests .
&quot; according to media reports , he was arrested at his return to Nairobi airport . &quot;
&quot; for a long time , Kenya has been under special observation at IO@@ C following numerous dop@@ ing contracts . &quot;
&quot; in the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls submitted by IO@@ C before the Rio Games , it was unusual to point out that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted . &quot;
the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency played a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer months in Brazil to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was passed a few weeks before the Olympic start .
&quot; as a result , the WA@@ DA has taken Kenya from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is compliant with the WA@@ DA rules . &quot;
Kenya is regarded as a great runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won most med@@ als at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
&quot; in a series of television reports of the ARD , alle@@ gations have been raised that dop@@ ing means are easily accessible in Kenya and there should be a significant mentality of sports bet@@ ru@@ gs . &quot;
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und asked for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had recru@@ ited them in Russian athle@@ tics .
&quot; in doing so , it was possible to prove that this sport was dop@@ ed nationwide and systematically . &quot;
Russia &apos;s athletes were then excluded from the summer games .
Salzburg &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
&quot; in the Shakespeare year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot;
&quot; with this , a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli . &quot;
&quot; Salzburg conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Leon@@ orn@@ ard Bernstein &apos;s masterpiece . &quot;
&quot; the artistic director , Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli , wanted to bring musical into the temple of classical music and met with the role of Maria a youth room . &quot;
&quot; in the orchestra pit , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var orchestra conducted under the leadership of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he enth@@ uses . &quot;
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and their melody .
&quot; it &apos;s a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra . &quot;
I would say that we really have Bernstein &apos;s music in our blood !
&quot; in this production , Bart@@ oli is playing an older Maria . &quot;
&quot; she re@@ members Tony with melanch@@ oly , while the younger Maria is playing and dancing . &quot;
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
firstly because it is musi@@ cally exceptional !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; she says in her song : &quot; &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
&quot; so it is smart , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate . &quot;
&quot; she is very similar to me , my Italian character , whom I have as a Roman , &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honor to work with her .
it is an immen@@ sely generous person .
and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
&quot; you see it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life ! &quot;
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , that is very important at all ! &quot;
&quot; for American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; &quot; this piece deals with prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
&quot; today we have the refugees , then the Pu@@ eb@@ ites went to New York , and the New York inhabitants did not want them . &quot;
&quot; they are the same subjects , and they are as meaningful today as those back then . &quot;
59 years later this piece is still relevant .
London &apos;s school girl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
&quot; Ka@@ di@@ za Sul@@ tana , one of three British school girls who left London last year to join the IS , re@@ port@@ edly died in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said that a few weeks ago her family heard about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria . &quot;
&quot; it was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air attack in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the Boll@@ werk of the Group in the country , reported I@@ TV news on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Sul@@ tana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she preten@@ ded to leave the war @-@ torn country and return to England . &quot;
&quot; one can only hope that the only good lies in it - as a warning and warning to others that these are the risks connected with it , to go into a war zone - to prevent people from ever making this decision , &quot; Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said . &quot;
&quot; in February 2015 , Sul@@ tana and two other girls from the east of London got a plane to Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border . &quot;
Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family was told that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months .

&quot; Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , believes that the democr@@ ats &quot; presidential candidate , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate the Ju@@ dge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ land &apos;s confirmation since his nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell believes that the next President will appoint the successor of the late judge at the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; on Thursday , Rei@@ d said during a telephone conference that he would expect Clinton to choose Gar@@ land &quot; with a certain degree of certainty . &quot; &quot;

he praised Gar@@ land and said Clinton &apos;s team would not care for rest@@ lessness with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the supreme judge for the U.S. App@@ ell@@ ational Tribunal for the District of Columbia .

the Tre@@ ats magazine collabor@@ ates with the photographer David Bel@@ le@@ mere to bring out a 1970s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .

Turkey : Kurdish congregation reck@@ ons with mass flight
&quot; anyone who doesn &apos;t care and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot;
&quot; in short , the Kur@@ d community of Germany expects tens of thousands of protection @-@ seekers fle@@ eing from Turkey to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the medium term it might even be &quot; &quot; some hundred thousand &quot; , &quot; the chairman Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot;
&quot; due to the tough@@ ness of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ yi@@ p Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kurdish congregation of Germany is expecting a mass flight to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with some hundreds of thousands of protection seekers from Turkey in Germany , if the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; says the chairman Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; of Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government has already passed Kurdish strongh@@ olds with road facts several months ago , 500,000 Kur@@ ds in Turkey are fle@@ eing . &quot;
&quot; after the desperate put@@ sch , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks would be added . &quot;
many will want to start anew in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state that receives refugees , produces refugees in their own country , &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k said . &quot;
&quot; the chief of the association mour@@ ned the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tical cities . &quot;
&quot; in this way , Erdo@@ gan hopes to increase the out@@ lying pressure on the remaining Kur@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been eradic@@ ated or distributed over the past hundred years , &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k said , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot;
the chief of the association demanded that the German government positioned itself &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and its supporters . &quot;
also in Germany there is a &quot; witch @-@ hunt &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critics .
&quot; for the first time in recent months , I am no longer feeling safe in Germany . &quot;
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
&quot; more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists . &quot;
the brand name as Gü@@ len @-@ trailer destro@@ ys teachers and other academ@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; he who does not adapt and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the Kem@@ alist and Sä@@ kul@@ aren , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the World . &quot;
&quot; as reported by the newspaper , on appeal to figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks have already set up the largest group of asylum seekers who have been recognized for political persecution in Germany before the coup . &quot;
&quot; as of June 30 , this was 11,@@ 3@@ 86 people and thus nearly 29 per cent of all eligible candidates ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this survey , they do not find themselves in the face of war , poverty or lack of prospects . &quot;
&quot; according to the Basic Law , asylum rights pursuant to the Basic Law are strictly political , i.e. from the state side , individually followed . &quot;
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go to where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals won &apos;t get anything from the summer campaign - and the vac@@ ation@@ ers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country &apos;s day .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
&quot; 2021 will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in Parliament already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; there is nothing more stupid than so far : summer holidays , heat and day @-@ to @-@ day election campaign - that bites . &quot;
the locals who are supposed to be convinced by the electoral campaig@@ ners are on holiday .
&quot; most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers who are in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , R@@ ügen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not locals , so you are not allowed to choose the country &apos;s day . &quot;
&quot; practical problems include : hel@@ pers , posters hang up , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers and en@@ umer@@ ate voices at the end , only lab@@ orious . &quot;
&quot; until 4 September 2016 , the election and last day of the holiday , Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania must once again pass elections close to the people . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if you can say that at all , just started . &quot;
&quot; and it &apos;s about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be afraid of his office . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in surveys . &quot;
exciting is how strongly new@@ ing Af@@ D cuts off and what remains at the end of co@@ ali@@ tions .
&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost in@@ conspic@@ uous election campaign , one can see from his big posters . &quot;
&quot; he travels through the country , disper@@ ses roses and ch@@ ats a bit with the people , as he did his legendary wor@@ m@@ ful predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff also . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , Seel@@ ering has got cold feet and gives chan@@ cell@@ or Merkel to blame for the blossom of the Af@@ D . &quot;
&quot; your refugee policy , you &quot; &quot; We create this &quot; &quot; has spe@@ eded up the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful office . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U , with its leading candidate , the Minister of Interior Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is , if at the wrong time it is the right place for election campaign . &quot;
she was invited twice Chancellor Angela Merkel to large @-@ scale demonstrations ; Merkel &apos;s federal election circuit is located in the north @-@ east .
&quot; but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Western Pom@@ er@@ ania . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot;
but it &apos;s not a shame to anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once .
&quot; apart from that , the Nord@@ ost @-@ CD@@ U largely wai@@ ves the usual election campaigns on market@@ places and in front of shopping centres with umbr@@ ellas and ballo@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; this , according to Kok@@ ert , only plays a &quot; subordin@@ ate role . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Union also noted that , in the country , the base is crum@@ bling , that it has to make a lot of effort to find a wire to the people again . &quot;
&quot; you see it as the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : there is hardly any available in the pages of the country . &quot;
&quot; the advice of the CD@@ U electoral campaig@@ ner co@@ co@@ ises to his comrades , however , also self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; &quot; they have to go where it hur@@ ts , namely , where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden Wed@@ dings , birthday party must be used . &quot;
&quot; because much is at stake , Sell@@ ering has now called his SPD to a particularly committed campaign . &quot;
&quot; in poll@@ s , the Socialists and Democrats were last with 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just just ahead of the Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the election of 2011 , the SPD had clearly won 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Gre@@ ens , a small party with seven percent in the poll@@ s , are likely to make the leap into the country &apos;s day . &quot;
they make a modern virtue out of their vac@@ ations and reloc@@ ate their campaign largely to the internet .
&quot; online election campaign , &quot; says the president of the country , Claudia Müller . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , green election campaig@@ ners embar@@ k on trace search for native voters among vac@@ ation@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , just cur@@ v@@ t with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg lakes and also finds it nice . &quot;
&quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; voting holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 rehabilitation : restaurants suffer from blocking
there is nothing to complain about at the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated .
&quot; for those responsible for the construction work , which start at 5.@@ 30 am and end only at 8@@ pm , there are always praise . &quot;
&quot; they made everything quite jag@@ ged , &quot; &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff from the jet fuel station . &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is no delay either .
&quot; the construction site could be reloc@@ ated to the south at the beginning of the week , until the end of October everything will be ready . &quot;
&quot; it will also be praised for those responsible for the construction work , for example when it comes to the establishment of ma@@ kes@@ hi@@ ft cru@@ ises . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site was moved to the south on Monday and the closure of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen was lifted , and therefore the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg again exists , the traffic situation within the place has relaxed . &quot;
the citizens can now drive from O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen to the B 27 on both sides .
passing traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were partly significant complaints , &quot; says the Deputy Chief Executive Officer Florian King , responsible for the transport @-@ related management of the rehabilitation . &quot;
&quot; the residents of Bach@@ er@@ straße , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many of the cre@@ ws were looking for and rather familiar with their na@@ vi than the sig@@ nage . &quot;
what led to the fact that some trucks in residential areas were fran@@ king .
&quot; as the speed limits were not comp@@ lied with , the municipality demanded more power from M@@ ös@@ singen . &quot;
&quot; there were considerable exceed@@ ances , &quot; &quot; says King , who made himself informed on the spot himself . &quot;
two to three per minute have been scored .
the quick@@ est was on the road with 77 kilometres per hour in the Tempo @-@ 30 zone .
&quot; since the construction site has moved on , it has become qui@@ eter . &quot;
for the business people at the B 27 it is only a small consol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg the road is open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but the fact that the B 27 refurb@@ ishment has led them to drop in revenue lets everyone look through .
&quot; however , some are more and some less affected . &quot;
&quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; end customer &quot; are produced for other companies , for whom the refurb@@ ishment has hardly any consequences . &quot;
&quot; also at the deal@@ er@@ ship Mai@@ er Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; most slight drop &quot; , &quot; but also ad@@ mits that &quot; &quot; the running race is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most heavily exploited are the restaurants along the road .
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , former crown , finds clear words . &quot;
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; not only did it , but all the restaurants have &quot; hit hard . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil were missing . &quot;
we must be glad about every euro turnover .
&quot; the sales revenue is more than 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the renovation of the streets has been dis@@ car@@ ded &quot; &quot; by two years . &quot;
half of his employees have to be dismissed .
&quot; if I had a company with 4,000 employees and half would have been fired , politics would have re@@ acted differently . &quot;
&quot; instead , government president Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request from G@@ öh@@ ner if there could be a financial compensation , with the hint that the restaurant would benefit from the advantages of the situation at the B 27 . &quot;
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties where something more generous has been handled .
&quot; with all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue . &quot;
&quot; after all , the family business has been here since 17@@ 15 , pointing to the long history . &quot;
&quot; that other regular guests are now less frequently visited , because of the complicated transport management , he can understand . &quot;
&quot; if you can &apos;t drive , it &apos;s also elsewhere nice . &quot;
&quot; after the renovation work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts . &quot;
&quot; despite the crises with BSE and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner considers the impact of the B 27 construction work on his clientele for the biggest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its long @-@ standing history . &quot;
&quot; six months of construction work , which is already brutal . &quot;
it is constantly being scre@@ wed in the name of the fight against terrorism .
&quot; after the latest attacks , Mai@@ zi@@ ère &apos;s Interior Minister now presents a thick security package . &quot;
but what has a state of tolerance to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the ser@@ ig@@ ner .
&quot; all his proposals are politically acceptable to the coalition partner , &quot; &quot; says the Minister of the Interior in the presentation of his new security package . &quot;
they do not challenge anybody .
&quot; other , more detailed points would initially be discussed within the parties . &quot;
I also took part in it .
&quot; but as Minister of the Interior , however , he was placed on results and at a &quot; &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; within the Coalition . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère did a little time before he presented his conclusions for security in the Republic . &quot;
but they are all the more extensive .
&quot; a lot is already known , announced , announced , that a new security authority is to take care of the crack of encrypted communication is not new . &quot;
it is also not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU regulations on passenger data and weapons law .
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is not surprising as well .
&quot; in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère starts a second approach for proposals not to be made with the SPD : he wants to raise sympathy for terrorist groups and kno@@ ck jihadi@@ sts with double citizenship to the German passport . &quot;
&quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; states the CD@@ U man . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he still considers this to be reasonable and also demands nothing that has no chances at the coalition partner anyway . &quot;
a few new ideas are presented de Mai@@ zi@@ ère too .
they partly have it in themselves : he is planning a quick procedure for de@@ port@@ ations and more possibilities for incar@@ cer@@ ation of people before deportation .
refugees who are targeted in the country should check their smartphones and disclose social media accounts for a security check .
&quot; in the case of toler@@ ations for rejected asylum seekers , he wants to make some even worse than previously - such as com@@ mitting crimes or deliberately throwing their papers away in order to mask their identity . &quot;
some of it is political and legally sanc@@ tioned .
some of them seem to have a bad effect and leave questions open .
&quot; and at some points - in the im@@ treatment of patients for example , the question arises : what does this have to do with security and terror ? &quot;
&quot; yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the subjects of refugees and terror . &quot;
but it cannot be said that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
&quot; in addition , many people worried about security in the face of the high number of refugees . &quot;
and things that people pro@@ found@@ ly dealt with could not be clas@@ sed in election times .
inner security has moved enormously into the focus .
&quot; first the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
&quot; and yes , there are election campaigns . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of internal security , the Union and the SPD are increasingly turning into position . &quot;
&quot; over the past few days , it was between the two parties . &quot;
&quot; only a gar@@ ris@@ ky argument about the equipment of the Federal Police , then about a security policy collection of some Union interior ministers , in which the resort chiefs also demand a Bur@@ ka ban and a return from the double nationality . &quot;
&quot; also here , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is struggling to reconci@@ le irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able sounds . &quot;
he doesn &apos;t think of a return from the double pass .
we have fixed the discussion in Germany .
to re @-@ stop it is not useful .
&quot; and with a Bur@@ ka ban , he has constitutional obj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; whether its own package is constitu@@ tionally un@@ constitutional and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , it has to be shown . &quot;
there &apos;s a lot of things to worry about .
&quot; however , the SPD is currently trying to benefit from internal security issues . &quot;
&quot; the leader of the party , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , first sign@@ alled his willingness to talk and says : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increase security . &quot;
Volkswagen is still getting worse .
&quot; despite diesel engines , delivery numbers are increasing worldwide . &quot;
but not all markets are running smoothly .
&quot; in the recall action , there is vor@@ ti@@ ces about a term . &quot;
Volkswagen starts the second half of the deliveries for deliveries .
&quot; despite its many brands and a number of well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s biggest car car continues to be a plus in spite of its many brands and well @-@ run markets . &quot;
&quot; in July , however , the core brand of VW , especially in Western Europe , weak@@ ening the overall sales , as the company announced in the Da@@ x . &quot;
&quot; in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars , the Volkswagen brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s month . &quot;
in the home market Germany the deliveries sack@@ ed almost a sixth .
&quot; sales of marketing Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weaker figures from July , especially to two sales days less in Europe . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in some core markets , the &quot; &quot; changing economic framework &quot; &quot; has been given a holding back . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote on the exit from the EU , too , explained a spokes@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; in the USA , where the exhaust gas industry first escal@@ ated , there is also a minus of beech . &quot;
large support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; all in all , the mainly affected house brand of the Nieder@@ sachsen will be further worsen@@ ed by the diesel scandal : after the first seven months , an extra@@ dition minus of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is available . &quot;
&quot; from January to July , Group sales of sales Fred Kap@@ pler continued to show a sales growth . &quot;
&quot; in this period , Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles worldwide , 5.@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide . &quot;
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated exhaust tests with a software .
&quot; in Germany alone , VW is calling about 2.5 million cars to retro@@ fit into the workshops . &quot;
&quot; in the course of retro@@ fitting , VW re@@ affir@@ med that the alter@@ ation of the cars has no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after retro@@ fitting the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power . &quot;
&quot; after retro@@ fitting the car , the car park guarantees a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate , but I do not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was stated on Friday in company circles . &quot;
the grounds are legal details .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen now guarantees its German customers a guarantee for equipped diesel models . &quot;
this would have confirmed VW representatives in the German Federal Aviation Office last Monday .
the Ministry of Transport confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; VW has fulfilled the requirements of my In@@ quiry Commission and KBA in full . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations from these are not accepted , &quot; declared Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has assumed the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power after retro@@ fitting does not take place and all type @-@ approved vehicle values have remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen himself uses the term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; but not as it was called in corporate travel . &quot;
&quot; for example , Volkswagen sees the possibility that for example , for half a year after the change@@ over , customers can come to a workshop for half a year - and this could lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; also in the interests of the customer , it is important to avoid any other damage that has nothing to do with the crash scandal as regards possible guarantee regulations as it was said . &quot;
&quot; therefore , VW does not use the term &quot; guarantee . &quot; &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen Bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands pen@@ al interest from wealthy savers - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; head of Bank Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; it is only about 139 customers , who park 40 million euros on sight deposit or daily money accounts . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Association of German B@@ anks speaks of an individual case and does not see any signal : &quot; &quot; normal savers &quot; &quot; would not have to worry about paying pen@@ alties for their austerity measures . &quot;
&quot; banks deposit money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they have to pay a penalty of 0.4 per cent . &quot;
&quot; this fee will require the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund back from September to private and corporate customers for deposits over 100,000 euros on sight deposit or daily cash accounts . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year in the future , &quot; Paul said . &quot;
&quot; for some time , he has been jumping 40 million euros , which could be withdrawn from one day to the other and which he cannot utilize . &quot;
&quot; they are on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent of the costs , &quot; said the Head of the Bank . &quot;
I cannot pay for each million 4000 euros .
&quot; after the pol@@ lu@@ ter pays principle , he now continues the costs . &quot;
&quot; letting the cash flow in the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank saf@@ es would be too dangerous : &quot; I &apos;ve already experienced four ra@@ ids , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! , &quot; said the Bank Chief . &quot;
most customers would have an understanding and changed to other forms of investment .
few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; the Co@@ operative Association of Bavaria stated : &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy course causes considerable costs in all banks . &quot;
&quot; to carry it alone , &quot; &quot; economically viable is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some German banks therefore have increased their fees for bank account management , credit cards or transfers . &quot;
the Thurin@@ gian Volks@@ bank and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger country made head@@ lines with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 with a three million euro deposits .
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , Chief Executive Officer of the Banking Union said : &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay nationwide fees for deposits , and the competition in Germany is much too strong among banks and savings banks . &quot;
&quot; a ban@@ ker said , at Lake T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; a clientele , which is a bit more luxuri@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; this can become a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; if she h@@ ates for free money . &quot;
&quot; founded in 1911 , G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ ta@@ ch @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; well @-@ known actors , sports@@ men and entrepreneurs live in the region . &quot;
&quot; currently no other banks are known to the Co@@ operative Association of Bavaria , who charge a replacement for deposits of private customers , &quot; said spokesperson Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the President of the Bundes@@ verband der deutschen Volks@@ banken and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ banken ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , announced at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go to negative with private customers is very , very high . &quot;
competition is hard and it threat@@ ens the emig@@ ration of investors to competition .
customers in Germany will not let this fall in width .
destination Pl@@ ates : who actually bu@@ ys records ?
lonely middle @-@ aged men love plates .
&quot; before you go to the comment section , to over@@ see it under the pseu@@ don@@ ym Non @-@ Alle@@ cul@@ ation Men &apos;s middle age with rough insul@@ ts , this statement deri@@ ves from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the re @-@ emergence of vinyl records is not attributable to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als who want to welcome the novel@@ ty of physical objects , but to mid @-@ life nostal@@ gia . &quot;
those who recently purchased a record are all for@@ esi@@ ght at the age of 45 and 54 .
&quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers . &quot;
it is also not a hor@@ des by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older turn@@ tables retain their feelings rather for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
&quot; if this blog was a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , a modest gray suit and wild@@ ly stu@@ ffed before I stop , hold my hands and say something intimate like : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
&quot; even though the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly for@@ fei@@ ting its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices fill the buildings where once independent vendors were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialty stores . &quot;
I would probably ask the c@@ amer@@ aman to switch off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind through observation .
&quot; Stu@@ art from Glas@@ gow , 55 , from Si@@ ster Ray ( Number of people : two young women , three men of middle age ) to Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Number of files : eight men of middle age , one woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours . &quot;
&quot; is he a collector , do I ask ? &quot;
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 s@@ labs . &quot;
&quot; these records , pictured above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I did not follow him home ) , dress the walls of his living room . &quot;
&quot; the reason he has such a considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford than they appeared and again bought items he sold when he was young and broke . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70 &apos;s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . &quot;
&quot; he agrees that those who buy records are more intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink much . &quot;
this is my vice .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers whom he meets will apply to the You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; however , he has also noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media group , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and are forced to buy their old records again . &quot;
&quot; from the conversations I have led , people tend to get rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999 . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy their CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says . &quot;
this would explain the boom on tra@@ ilers of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of records ?
it takes only a few seconds in a business like Ph@@ onica to recognize that record stores offer a soothing community of like @-@ minded people .
&quot; according to We@@ z , some of the older customers responded to the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;
&quot; some plate fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to get back to the stability of familiar vinyl covers , from objects that wake up happy youth memories . &quot;
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or property of material possessions as a kind of consol@@ ation , &quot; says We@@ z . &quot;
this is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people .
it &apos;s a simple way to deal mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; an employee fli@@ cks off a panel stack . &quot;
a survey by IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to them .
&quot; the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record have no record player . &quot;
&quot; at this time of the news report , I would probably look very concerned as I sc@@ atter on a pile of Bos@@ sa Nova compil@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at sounds of the Universe ( number of people : three men of middle age ) has noticed a &quot; &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; &quot; of the revival . &quot;
&quot; someone just came in here and said , &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I would like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead disk so I can put it on the shelf , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens . &quot;
&quot; more product @-@ proof , less music @-@ class . &quot;
we have people who say : &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older ones , who only slowly enter . &quot;
&quot; F@@ op@@ p , dedicated to the records of almost a whole floor , has a colourful audience when I go in . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ age boys and middle @-@ aged women . &quot;
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts New Year &apos;s newest syn@@ th@@ esi@@ ze and sex@@ ery pop instead of experimental jazz gro@@ ans from the loud@@ speakers - it &apos;s good to see such diversity among the customers .
&quot; none of them looks strange , but na@@ iling psychological trauma is hard to detect if you stand beside someone for 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running in business for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale . &quot;
it makes a window bum@@ ble@@ bee as a big shopping .
&quot; it doesn &apos;t deserve much , so collecting boards is not a real option , she says . &quot;
it costs a lot .
&quot; it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in another way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of plate lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
&quot; while I look at the jeans pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls , who are group@@ ing themselves around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras for a moment before a father and daughter think about buying a Cros@@ ley record player . &quot;
&quot; on the left is a staircase , a wall full of panels of Ad@@ ele , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; no one looks at them - perhaps , because they are only purely decorative , some so far up that it is impossible to touch them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
&quot; but considering that any attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and some customers could send in the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain about . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates . &quot;
&quot; even if my research shows that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they leave , at least in record stores in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors , who exist in reality , record stores and online forums . &quot;
these people are probably working hard at school or in offices .
&quot; they spend their th@@ urs@@ day tomorrow with security not with the bum@@ ble through record shops of Ber@@ wick Street and the sheets through records , while avoiding the star@@ ing gaze of an un@@ cann@@ y , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false present@@ er who sha@@ kes no clu@@ stering men of middle @-@ age over the shoulders . &quot;

&quot; a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Cal@@ ais jungle in which thousands of refugees live . &quot;
&quot; in a trial hearing this week , the authorities argued in Cal@@ ais that the state should be authorized to sell 72 provisional businesses in which individuals within the bearing sell goods , cigar@@ ettes to En@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , sell , offer hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants . &quot;
&quot; the Cal@@ ais pre@@ f@@ ecture has argued that these places should be demol@@ ished , because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid , and that have a fire and health risk . &quot;
&quot; humanitarian groups told the court that shops and restaurants were important , as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
they also concluded that temporary shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who operate the 72 provisional businesses , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were absolutely understandable . &quot;
&quot; judge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than merely feeding people living in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
&quot; one of the places that was threatened by the decline was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the Camp , which is operated in vain and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as a consultation on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
&quot; more than 170@@ ,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids &apos; Café . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that the closing &quot; &quot; for these children would be a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years old are . &quot;
&quot; the two aid organizations &quot; &quot; Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants &quot; &quot; estimated on Friday that the number of migrants in the Dsch@@ ung@@ ell@@ ager rose to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in new arri@@ vals during the summer . &quot;
despite Olympic disappointment : Martin remains milit@@ ant
&quot; despite his dis@@ appo@@ inting appearance in the Olympic cycle , he doesn &apos;t want to stop Tony Martin . &quot;
&quot; I keep in mind the World Cup , remain confident and fight , &quot; the 31 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook . &quot;
he did not have an explanation for his miserable twel@@ fth place at the Zu@@ ck@@ erh@@ ut .
&quot; I honestly don &apos;t think it &apos;s hard to comment on the timing of yesterday , &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot;
let him analyse the reasons for the de@@ bac@@ le .
&quot; at the World Cup in October in Qatar , Martin wanted to fight for the title . &quot;
I will look at everything we have changed in recent times .
&quot; this also includes my position , &quot; &quot; wrote the triple timer World Champion who had lost on Wednesday at the 5@@ 4.5 km more than three minutes on Olympic Champion Fab@@ ian Canc@@ ell@@ ara ( Switzerland ) . &quot;

group increases with start @-@ up for live video games
watching other people watching video games is huge - Microsoft also wants to benefit .
the technology group bu@@ ys the start @-@ up beam which specializes in this hobby .
Microsoft announced on Thursday how much money flows for the tak@@ eover .
&quot; Be@@ am went to the start with his offer only in January and already has more than 100,000 users . &quot;
&quot; you can watch others while playing , but also interfere with yourself . &quot;
&quot; for example , they can give up missions to players and face enemies as well as provide equipment . &quot;
the player Activ@@ ision Bli@@ zz@@ ard launches a new HD video service for the bo@@ oming world of E @-@ Sports .
on the way to global media event Facebook is to help .
the advertising industry is already listening .
&quot; the start @-@ ups , which has its headquarters in Seattle in the US state of Washington , move to Microsoft Head@@ quarters in Red@@ mond , as Be@@ am co @-@ founder and chief Matt Sal@@ sam@@ end@@ i announced . &quot;
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; according to Microsoft , Be@@ am is integrated into the video game department around the X@@ box console . &quot;
the market of live streaming of video games is growing rapidly .
known platforms are T@@ witch and YouTube Gaming .
T@@ witch was bought by online retailer Amazon in 2014 - for almost a billion dollars .

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
&quot; Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers have to adapt to the next generation speed sensor : in different federal states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flas@@ hes will be tested , which should be particularly effective . &quot;
&quot; the futur@@ istic En@@ forcement tra@@ ilers of Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden , for example , can be used in areas of accident , where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police . &quot;
&quot; for example , on motorway construction sites or to rehabil@@ itated bridges with temporary speed @-@ polishing , there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that there is a stationary bl@@ ur for adher@@ ence to speed limits . &quot;
a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly .
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts for five days at un@@ interrupted measuring operation ; the case data are transmitted encrypted over a modem .
&quot; with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be captured at the same time across multiple tracks . &quot;
&quot; variable speed limits and access b@@ ans by time , road and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
&quot; in the highly experienced state , one can move the trailer according to manufacturer with each car with trailer hit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; so that it is not easily st@@ owed , it is lowered in the measuring mode , allowing the wheels to disappear in the arm@@ oured and by the way also non @-@ cast outer man@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter from v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to Vit@@ ronic in different federal states and is now also used . &quot;
&quot; foreign authorities also flash with the new technique : recently France has ordered 100 pieces , following an order of 150 pieces last year . &quot;
great Britain gets silver in the 7 @-@ er ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class recovered Gold
the impressive performance of Britain at the 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt on Thursday evening at the final hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were struck here in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ odor@@ o Stadium .
&quot; Fi@@ ji distributed a master class in handling , side @-@ step@@ ping , back @-@ back , line and ro@@ her power to win gold - her first Olympic medal of any color . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was lost due to the not too bad consol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day could fall on them in the final . &quot;
&quot; but regardless of this , Fi@@ ji would have struck a 15 @-@ man team in the form of this form . &quot;
it could be a consol@@ ation for GB - but will probably not - that at least one Br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben R@@ yan , the former head of England from Wim@@ ble@@ don . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind it .
eight years ago they lost each game at Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens under R@@ yan .
here they only lose one .
&quot; this hat@@ ch will hurt , but progress is amazing . &quot;
Fi@@ ji started wonderful and left the attacks G@@ Bs out of fun .
&quot; the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 upwards , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au moved in the corner . &quot;
&quot; after four minutes of playing time , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner , which he converted . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
&quot; a h@@ ack of Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of Sierra Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to achieve a third goal , but it only stopped Fi@@ ji . &quot;
in the seventh minute there was a touch@@ down in the right corner and there was 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new whi@@ stle and there was still a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u comp@@ eted by further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the UK team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
&quot; it &apos;s like Fi@@ ji was born to play 7 , while GB is still learning . &quot;
this is how it is .
&quot; GB introduced fundamental changes to the half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for a whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova went through to a brilliant intermediate play of Fi@@ ji . &quot;
&quot; Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went for a long time in favor of the South Sea sul@@ phi@@ ans , whose fans che@@ ered , flags and danced on the tri@@ bun@@ e . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire Fi@@ j@@ is &apos;s playful approach .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last seconds .
&quot; the whi@@ stle sounded , the Fi@@ j@@ is embra@@ ced and G@@ TC ki@@ cked cr@@ ushing into the grass . &quot;
earlier on the day Fi@@ ji Japan defeated Japan in the semi@@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pushed South Africa in a tight semi @-@ fin@@ als match from the race - Britain &apos;s conversion of the difference .
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks to the front in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke through the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a score among the posts in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant late Tac@@ kl@@ ing by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team secured the win - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the fight with the trainer &apos;s cancer
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ eric gold than with these games and that will mean something .
&quot; from the first ru@@ dder to the last , 220 Hard H@@ ieve who enter the story , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning at their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even though there were only those who sat at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . &quot;
&quot; her domin@@ ance was absolute , after all her 3@@ 9.@@ ter un@@ written assignment , which is also unprecedented . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant female athletes , who gli@@ de across the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the nature of the triumph . &quot;
behind every gold in the herd is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make the difference and no one was more aid than the coach who did not know whether he would survive this day at all than he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said he ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer that is oper@@ able and they did .
&quot; if you do not do that , it spreads everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a bit the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio was lucky that he was able to begin treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , if that is the right concept at all . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to get better soon . &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice . &quot;
this is how it starts .
&quot; rowing in itself is a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one . &quot;
&quot; in the immedi@@ acy of victory her first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a frustr@@ ating morning doing something more than usual , trying to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; p@@ anning , which was a captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery Regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said &quot; &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . that &apos;s a bit extreme , but it means so much . &quot;
it only repe@@ ats how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin have worked for .
it was three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
&quot; without Robin we would be no one , so a massive thanks goes to him . he is the best coach in the world . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person for training or a better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning lost no race over the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
&quot; even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to close , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve . &quot;
we were caught very at the moment .
&quot; Hel@@ en called &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is really important not to let yourself be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not looking forward to doing something great .
&quot; today we didn &apos;t want fire@@ works , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race what we did . &quot;
the couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about his future .
Glo@@ ver has to appear next week on a wedding in her own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that it was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
&quot; in London , it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympic Champion . &quot;
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; it feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; for 31 years , exemplary for clarity &quot;
&quot; the managing director of the &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ Group , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , will reti@@ re . &quot;
&quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; Bavarian &quot; &quot; exemplary . &quot;
a small Fran@@ con@@ ian drinking water @-@ purpose association as a model for the large water producers .
&quot; some time ago , it meant that the original sound was part of the Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk &apos;s contribution . &quot;
little later the water forum of the government of Unter@@ fran@@ ken stran@@ gled the association .
&quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group was &quot; &quot; Bavarian &quot; &quot; as exemplary . &quot;
&quot; behind all this , Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was a member of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband employee for 31 years , was 28 years as managing director . &quot;
now he was retired at the age of 65 .
&quot; the drinking water @-@ purpose association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ Group , based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality Breit@@ brunn , promotes annually about 150@@ ,000 cubic metres of water and provides 32 locations and hamlet with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; municipalities are the municipalities of Kirch@@ heimer , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of Ba@@ un@@ ach . &quot;
there are water supply contracts for further towns and municipalities .
&quot; the current president , Breit@@ brun@@ ner Mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was appointed as a water@@ wart in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband in 1988 . &quot;
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organisation activities , budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends , &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
&quot; as outstanding events , it called the inaugur@@ ation and inaugur@@ ation of the new wells ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new wells ( 1998 ) and compensation for farmers , the refurb@@ ishment of a central computer control ( 2004 ) , and the renewal of water pipes . &quot;
&quot; there has been no stand@@ still , and you have always added innovations , because water is life @-@ consuming and drinking water is the most important food . &quot;
&quot; in her lau@@ dati@@ o , she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers loyal , reliable and correct service for over 31 years . &quot;
he has worked with a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose association and he has lived the water @-@ purpose association correctly as if it were his own company .
&quot; a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ Group on nit@@ rate lowering in front of the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia district . &quot;
for this he received a lot of recognition and praise .
&quot; Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , for his part , praised Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years . &quot;
he is the best water man and he was a faithful boy .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
&quot; as highlights from his point of view , he described the structure of the well and the restructuring of the association . &quot;
&quot; however , the biggest challenge and the most difficult use were the pipe rup@@ ture at the high reservoir at Kirch@@ lou@@ der on a 3rd January . &quot;
&quot; here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night , so that the villages could be supplied with water . &quot;
&quot; even the supply of Neu@@ brunn can only be maintained , because one filled the reservo@@ irs of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses . &quot;
the management of the drinking water @-@ purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter who will follow Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .

relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - man shoots at risk of life
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday at 10.@@ 45 a.m. and injured her .
&quot; the man called himself with us and stated to have shot his companion of life , &quot; &quot; said a police spokesperson . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator is on the run , according to him I am publicly punished . &quot;
&quot; now nationwide , because Sven S. could be on the road with the car . &quot;
&quot; the man is about 1,80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ burnt and has a bald head . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the police have published a photo of him . &quot;
&quot; however , it is a few years old . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the man has a bald head . &quot;
the man should not be addressed directly .
&quot; he could still carry the gun with him , the police . &quot;
who sees Sven S. should call the 110 .
the police speaks of a &quot; relationship . &quot;
&quot; the victim was born in 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator in 1981 . &quot;
&quot; the responsible police in Lü@@ beck initially did not want to provide any information about the Ta@@ ther@@ ness or the relationship between perpetr@@ ators and victims , but confirmed that a human being had been killed . &quot;
&quot; it is a killing off@@ ender . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t say any more , &quot; &quot; said a police spokesperson in Lü@@ beck . &quot;
&quot; according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special operational command ( SE@@ K ) was at the crime scene . &quot;
steel - flash@@ light for German steel industry
the crisis @-@ packed and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed by additional costs in millions of dollars .
financial burdens threatened by the industry from green electricity production are from the table .
&quot; it remains at the release of the Renew@@ able Energy Tran@@ sition in the existing plants for so @-@ called own electricity production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) . &quot;
I &apos;m really happy that we could finally reach that after two years of tough negotiations .
&quot; accordingly , the European Commission had initially planned to ask the steel producers to use the gases from the blast furnace for electricity generation for their own consumption . &quot;
&quot; according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year . &quot;
Gabriel told the WA@@ Z that there is now a basic agreement with the EU Commission after talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
&quot; only when generators are replaced in the steel plants , an EEG conversion rate of 20 percent is required . &quot;
but also this will not be le@@ vi@@ ed in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission for self @-@ power production .
&quot; in this way , the status quo of the previous regulation will be largely written . &quot;
Gabriel &apos;s successful efforts are of particular significance for the steel industry .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; steel is the future , &quot; this is a first step . &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; also in the reform of the emissions legislation , climate and employment targets are to be weighed , &quot; says IG Metall @-@ CEO Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has suffered over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008 .
&quot; in the past year , the situation escal@@ ated further , when the world &apos;s largest producer of electricity produced massive steel on the world market in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand . &quot;
European manufacturers are throwing price d@@ umping into Chinese steel companies .
&quot; in the course of this spring , the situation has somewhat relaxed . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , fla@@ wed import duties on import steel effect , on the other hand , the economic prospects in China have risen . &quot;
it is unclear how sustainable the price pick @-@ up is .
the German industry leader Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp was cau@@ tious on Thursday .
&quot; last but not least , the prices had rather stagn@@ ated . &quot;
the industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
&quot; at the end , Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp also did not want to exclude the closure of individual works . &quot;
&quot; in the German steel industry , around 8@@ 6,000 people were employed at the end of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in July , despite rising prices and increasing orders , German steel manufacturers remain cau@@ tious . &quot;
&quot; with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year , as the Steel Business Association announced on Friday . &quot;
&quot; after a short increase in May , the quantity produced now went back to each other for the second month . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production has fallen by two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot;
&quot; in the coming months , the association expects an improvement in order situation thanks to an improved order situation . &quot;
&quot; community , spirit , health : singing is good for sen@@ iors &quot;
&quot; singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp for her whole life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , in the Leh@@ ra@@ mt study she occupied the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir . &quot;
&quot; singing inspir@@ es me emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; she describes . &quot;
&quot; after a rehear@@ sal she feels balanced , cheerful and more alive , she says . &quot;
&quot; by the way , she does something good with her health and spirit . &quot;
&quot; singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several perspectives , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German senior league . &quot;
&quot; most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; through regular meetings , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts . &quot;
often social and family structures dissolve in old age ; a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; to speak and organize , to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot;
&quot; singing can be stren@@ uous in the positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; for doing so , sen@@ iors train deep and controlled breathing . &quot;
anyone who regularly demands his lungs doesn &apos;t get out of the box too quickly in everyday life .
&quot; even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice in age , singing is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; elderly people often have a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Labour Association of the Sen@@ iors Organ@@ iz@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations , joint singing had a much higher significance , it was part of everyday life , both in school and leisure time . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs aw@@ akes many memories in older people , often associated with positive feelings of her youth . &quot;
&quot; through lyrics and especially melodies , people with dementia care about long @-@ lying events . &quot;
&quot; when singing , a special performance is required for the head , L@@ enz explains . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , concentrate on one &apos;s own voice and a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge . &quot;
&quot; especially older people , who live alone , practice so not only to concentrate on themselves . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
also the self @-@ esteem grows through singing in the choir .
&quot; to show oneself : if I practise for a long time , I get better and alert beyond me - this experience strengthens . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start singing , so there is enough . &quot;
&quot; those who want to try out a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks they have little talent , L@@ enz advises . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who can hear when a sound is next to it ? &quot;
&quot; looking for the suitable offer , senior citizens have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; when someone sings of the circle of acquaint@@ ances in a sen@@ iors choir , one can simply connect . &quot;
many cities also offer views of cho@@ irs in the surrounding area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or the church leader .
many senior cho@@ irs can also be found on the Internet .
&quot; if you don &apos;t have access to the Internet , your family , friends or neighbours can ask for help with Internet research . &quot;
&quot; if you want to sing , you should necessarily join a choir , advises H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
singing is good for the soul and has something liber@@ ating - that is true for any age .

&quot; they respond by ten percent faster to l@@ utes of k@@ itt@@ ens , who have found themselves in great need , as scientists have found out of the Veter@@ inary Academy and the Medical School Hannover ( M@@ H@@ H ) . &quot;
tom@@ cats also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - however always the same .
&quot; apparently the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly arous@@ ed young for the males either not percep@@ tible or not of significance , &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the M@@ H@@ H . &quot;
she is the author of the study published on this Friday in the magazine &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; in a previous investigation , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens cries out with the ur@@ gency of their need@@ iness . &quot;
a total of nine adult males and eight que@@ ens were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the M@@ H@@ H .
they were played for a call of small children who were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and separated from the mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
&quot; on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of more excited k@@ itt@@ ens , which were raised in addition . &quot;
&quot; despite the small sample , the researchers keep their results meaningful . &quot;
&quot; all females , even those who did not have their own offspring , re@@ acted differenti@@ ally to the scre@@ ams , &quot; Kon@@ er@@ ding said . &quot;
&quot; they turned faster to the loudspeaker , when this rep@@ ut@@ ations of the more excited kit@@ ten played . &quot;
this ability may be con@@ genital or develop with sexual maturity .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have already examined the reactions of women and men on baby noises several times in humans . &quot;
&quot; some studies also showed that women were more sensitive to babies , regardless of whether they were mothers or not , bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported . &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ ski reaches the Super@@ cup with &quot; Gala &quot;
Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
&quot; in Turkey , an arrest warrant was issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r . &quot;
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the coup attempt , an important football match takes place in Turkey . &quot;
&quot; before Du@@ eling the arch @-@ ri@@ vals between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced . &quot;
&quot; even when the state of emergency came into force after the attempted coup attempt in July , the government , the everyday life of normal citizens should not be com@@ promised . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the attempted coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , football is not stopped either . &quot;
&quot; against the former Str@@ ong Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r , the public prosec@@ utor issued an arrest warrant . &quot;
&quot; according to this , the South American living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
Sü@@ kü@@ r is said to be followers of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len responsible for the attempted coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ yi@@ p Erdo@@ gan .
&quot; in fact , the state of emergency suspended for 90 days is still valid until October , but in fact it did not have any impact on the lives of most Turks . &quot;
&quot; the ni@@ ghtly &quot; &quot; democracy guards &quot; &quot; on public places throughout the country have declared that Erdo@@ gan has ended on Wednesday . &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - divided into supporters and opponents Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the club &apos;s club Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the friends of the president .
&quot; what unites the Turks , however , in the face of dramatic experiences in history , is the strict rejection of military put@@ sch . &quot;
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger &quot; Gala , &quot; it will be particularly back to Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; the Cologne in the past season proved its sporty value : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first playing time as top scor@@ er of his association . &quot;
in the end@@ game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory hit .
the newspaper &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured his team the cup .
&quot; thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the dis@@ appo@@ inting season for the record master found a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion . &quot;
&quot; after the round kno@@ ck@@ out in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; also leave early in the Europa League . &quot;
&quot; in the Sü@@ per Li@@ g , it was only enough to rank six . &quot;
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; we have done that , and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas , the game year was better . &quot;
&quot; thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who with 26 season op@@ ers as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ ey @-@ King laid the base for the 14th title . &quot;
this is also the reason that the fans will continue to hope for the return of the 31 year old .
&quot; at the time of the coup attempt at AC Florence , he had known only borrow@@ ed Gom@@ ez after the coup attempt , not to return because of the political situation in the country after his European holiday . &quot;
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he just needs to say , &quot; &quot; the specialist magazine &quot; &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; boss Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man quoted . &quot;
&quot; however , the storm would have to be ready to renoun@@ ce about a third of its annual sal@@ aries estimated at 7.5 million euros , Or@@ man clearly stated : &quot; we cannot pay his salary in Florence . &quot;
despite D@@ oping : these athletes have still med@@ als chances at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova is not allowed to start in Rio .
others over@@ taken Ath@@ le@@ tics sinners can laugh about it - they fight in Rio for med@@ als .
the topic of dop@@ ing is still the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics .
&quot; the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers Juli@@ ja Je@@ fi@@ m@@ ova , who had been acc@@ using after a dop@@ ing barrier , shortly before the games , became mer@@ cil@@ essly fl@@ atten@@ ed at her start ( 100 meters breast ) . &quot;
&quot; there was a whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal scene : with a set smile she was still in the hall , and provoked her appearance . &quot;
&quot; when it was clear that she won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out into a rush of applause . &quot;
but there are many more sports@@ men who go to the start despite the D@@ oping past at the Rio Olympics .
here is an overview :
&quot; J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he was locked twice for dop@@ ing twice ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
&quot; since its spell , the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion has been running even faster than before , it &apos;s the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is considered the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t . &quot;
&quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to sit down in 2010 after taking the pain medication Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; after an operation , she had a strong pain in her teeth , defending the 29 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Dis@@ cus / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the 2012 Olympic Champion , World Champion of 2013 and European Championship , was positively tested for the banned stimul@@ ant Meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine from 2010 to 2016 . &quot;
Per@@ kovic denied the in@@ exhaus@@ tible intake and was blocked for six months .
the four fur@@ th@@ est th@@ rows this year go to the account of the great gold favor@@ i@@ tin .
&quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic Champion and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , was positively tested in 2010 and closed for 21 months . &quot;
a means of penis enlargement was responsible for bet@@ tering Mer@@ ritt .
&quot; this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m . &quot;
&quot; Ivan Ti@@ ch@@ on ( hammer throw , Belarus ) : hardly any athlete had so many med@@ als subsequently recognized . &quot;
thus Ti@@ ch@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later after he was found testosterone dop@@ ing .
the 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to release Olympia @-@ silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid @-@ dop@@ ing and the EM @-@ title 2006 because of testosterone ab@@ uses .
he also returned to the Bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games due to a sentence of the International Court of Sport ( CA@@ S ) .
&quot; at 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m , he ranks second in the world ranking . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the world record and gold favorite was tested positively in May , but may still start in Rio . &quot;
&quot; during the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , indications of taking a forbidden dietary supplement were found , the lock of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA fell mil@@ dly and ran off on July 13th . &quot;
bomb terror in Thailand - Austri@@ ans injured - Sever@@ al dead
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said Foreign Ministry spokesman Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; she suffered chi@@ cks and was treated in hospital , but had already left it . &quot;
she planned her home trip for the beginning of September .
&quot; it is still unclear whether the further explo@@ sions on holiday island Ph@@ u@@ ket and in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ p@@ he are also affected by Austrian citizens . &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities , such as Schn@@ ö@@ ll . &quot;
&quot; the Hu@@ a H@@ in , located approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , initially explo@@ ded two bombs on Thursday evening in a life quarter . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , among them the Austri@@ ans , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning two explo@@ sions went up again , and another man was killed according to the authorities . &quot;
&quot; even from Ph@@ u@@ ket , a bomb explosion was reported in the morning . &quot;
&quot; at Det@@ on@@ ation near the popular beach of Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured after police instructions . &quot;
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , killing an urban employee . &quot;
&quot; according to the authorities in a flower be@@ et , the explo@@ sives had gone to the air in front of the prec@@ inct of the coastal police . &quot;
&quot; finally , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast and in Ch@@ om@@ p@@ he on the south @-@ east coast demanded several injured . &quot;
&quot; one goes from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , called it . &quot;
&quot; the bomb attacks carry the same hand@@ writing , &quot; &quot; said army general Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ am@@ av@@ ee Friday morning to journalists . &quot;
we assume that it is a coordinated attack .
&quot; it is too early to express themselves to possible motives , but probably it is a matter of the actions of Muslim rebels . &quot;
Thai media also wanted to recognise a pattern typical of the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
&quot; the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not related to the Islam@@ ist insurrection or international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a spokesman in Bangkok . &quot;
rather they assume that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta were laid .
&quot; in recent days , the authorities would have kept secret references to upcoming attacks in the south of the country , but they were not informed of the exact time and places . &quot;
it is still unclear which group is behind the attacks .
&quot; the police instructed their officials across the country to strengthen security around important government buildings , airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand , there are still smaller bom@@ b@@ ings again , but mostly they do not address tourists . &quot;
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used over years by Tha@@ il@@ ands king B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; according to the current bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends its homepage to follow the instructions given by the Thai security authorities . &quot;
&quot; high security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings . &quot;
&quot; after confron@@ tations between security forces and Muslim populations , the necessary trips to these provinces will be cancelled . &quot;
increased safety risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were made a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution issued by the jun@@ ta .
this gives the military great influence over the coming years .
&quot; Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said that the bombs were an attempt to create chaos , while the country is moving towards stability , improving economic conditions and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military un@@ ta , who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , would benefit himself to restore the kingdom to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , it is not possible for the military to get a grip on the uprising of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years . &quot;
more than 6@@ 500 people were killed in the conflict .
&quot; just about a year ago , in Bangkok at an attack on a popular Hin@@ du shr@@ ine , 20 people were killed - most of them foreign tourists . &quot;
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack of the country &apos;s recent history .
the right &quot; identity movement &quot; has been targeted by the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection .
&quot; after several national offices , the constitutional prot@@ ectors in the Con@@ federation have also placed the group under observation . &quot;
&quot; we see in the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; indications for aspir@@ ations against the liberal democratic constitution , &quot; &quot; said constitutional chief Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate of the Deutsche Presse @-@ Agentur in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in this way , immigrants from Islamic faith or the Middle East will be de@@ fam@@ ed in an extrem@@ ist manner . &quot;
that &apos;s why we are watching the movement now .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it turns against &quot; multi@@ cul@@ tur@@ alism , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity through alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; constitutional prot@@ ectors in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , H@@ esse , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thurin@@ gia - are already observing the &quot; Identi@@ ty . &quot; &quot;
&quot; at the decision , Ma@@ ate said that his authority was closely aligned with the state offices . &quot;
&quot; groups like the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; said the constitutional leader . &quot;
&quot; generally , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with a more you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
the fac@@ ul@@ ties of Islam as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not a bet@@ u@@ sive advertising for one &apos;s own cause .
the propaganda is meant to appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly susceptible .
that is dangerous .
&quot; last but not least , there were reports from several federal states about contacts of the &quot; Identi@@ ty &quot; to Af@@ D politicians . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , for that he had no knowledge . &quot;
&quot; for constitutional protection , possible contacts of this species are only relevant at a certain point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain persons who are extrem@@ ist , will change their direction and become so extrem@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; the decisive factor , therefore , is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party . &quot;
this is not recognizable .
&quot; with a view to the marked increase in legal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugees , Ma@@ ate said he would not yet speak of new right terrorism in this regard . &quot;
but over the past few years we have found that there can be justi@@ fiable structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the free group .
&quot; it may well be that other right @-@ wing groups or small groups are planning attacks against asylum seekers , against refugee camps or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives . &quot;
but a nationwide or Europe @-@ wide control of right @-@ wing terrorism is not recognizable .
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; worried , Ma@@ ate expressed that many attacks went to the account of people who did not appear in the right scene before . &quot;
this is wor@@ rying .
&quot; many of the susp@@ ects on asylum accommodations have not previously been known as criminals , politically motivated off@@ ences or followers of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; so many people have committed crimes that have had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts who might have been politically in@@ different or elected for example , CD@@ U , SPD or left , which , however , have become radi@@ cal@@ ised by right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist m@@ oods . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
the Olympic Games or World Records do not always determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the courageous appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; at the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly overweight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia slowly swa@@ m so slowly that it was temporarily no longer visible in the TV pictures . &quot;
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the neckl@@ ine was selected .
&quot; in social networks , Hab@@ te became a viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished his race with a return of 48 seconds and finished the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters . &quot;
but it was rather his not just sporty character that attracted the attention of the international media .
why does the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still participate in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start@@ right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries more well @-@ known .
&quot; since most athletes are running in Ethiopia , Hab@@ te wanted to do something different . &quot;
preparation is everything : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ names made the lap .
some media referred to him as &quot; ro@@ bel of the whale . &quot;
&quot; based on a &quot; &quot; prosperity &quot; &quot; the English tab@@ loid &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; made fun of him with &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; his time , he only struck a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter Fre@@ estyle , played no role . &quot;
compar@@ isons with Eric the E@@ el were also drawn .
&quot; at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i took care of media attention . &quot;
&quot; unforgettable was the appearance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to stand alone in a pre @-@ race over 100 meters of Fre@@ estyle . &quot;
M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim only eight months before the Olympic Games and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .

Ger@@ ets@@ ried - The owner of a store at the New Place has been best@@ owed .
&quot; according to the police , the 67 @-@ year @-@ old Ger@@ ets@@ rie@@ der left their business on Monday at 5.@@ 30 p.m. and forgot to close a window on the ground floor . &quot;
&quot; when she came back at 8.@@ 15 a.m. the next morning , the check@@ out had disappeared 250 Euro . &quot;
traces of the perpetr@@ ator could not be found .
video surveillance is also not available .
Tr@@ ump does not see the threatening election defeat so close
&quot; the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate , Donald Tr@@ ump , speaks at an election campaign in Florida . &quot;
&quot; if there is nothing to be done with the election of the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump has already had an alternative video . &quot;
he then goes on holiday .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump loses the US presidential election in November , it wouldn &apos;t matter : &quot; &quot; ultimately it will either fold or I have a very , very nice , long holiday , &quot; &quot; said the candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in a telephone interview with the US TV station CN@@ BC . &quot;
&quot; if it is not enough for him at the end for political correctness , this is fine , said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; he called US President Barack Obama and the candidate of democr@@ ats , H@@ illary Clinton , as founder of the terrorist militia Islamic State ( IS ) . &quot;
&quot; within his party , more and more resistance formed . &quot;
post increases in trade with electric v@@ ans
an electric delivery vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other firms in the vehicle is obviously great .
the post plans to sell their electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter also .
&quot; soon , the Group intends to launch trade with transpor@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; the next year , the post will also offer its electric transpor@@ ters on the free car market . &quot;
&quot; we want to get into the sale to third parties , &quot; said a post @-@ speaker on Friday . &quot;
&quot; for months , the company has been testing whether to sell its self @-@ developed stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter , with which letters and pack@@ ets are sold , also to other companies . &quot;
&quot; post @-@ CEO Jürgen Ger@@ da had said that there are repeat@@ ed@@ ely questioning , for example by craftsmen . &quot;
&quot; according to the news magazine Der Spiegel , the Bon@@ ner Group wants to enter the mass production of the vehicles shortly . &quot;
&quot; in the post@@ own factory , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars a year and shift . &quot;
&quot; Ger@@ da had announced that the Group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric vehicles and , in the long term , a complete change@@ over to environmentally friendly vehicles . &quot;
&quot; we will make a very tough step towards 2020 , &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot;
I can imagine that we change the entire fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter is active on Germany &apos;s roads since 2014 .
G@@ FR@@ P leadership emerges after dis@@ appo@@ inting business figures
the consumer research company Gf@@ K exchanges his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the rel@@ ent@@ ations suddenly came - but not surprisingly .
&quot; the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K has shown that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann will be even more uncertain , the longer the successes promised by him . &quot;
turbul@@ ence at the head of the Nuremberg market research company Gf@@ K : after again dis@@ appo@@ inting business figures and the res@@ ignation of corporate management the global number five of the industry is facing a new beginning .
&quot; at the end of the year , the G@@ FR@@ P executive boss plans to leave the company . &quot;
the Chairman of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert already leaves the Supervisory Board with effect on 12 September .
&quot; the management board of the Executive Board already handed over the previous board member Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger on September 1 , 2013 . &quot;
he is supposed to officially take over the function of a &quot; CEO &quot; until a successor for Hart@@ mann is found .
the company called &quot; different opinions &quot; for the long @-@ term business orientation as a reason for the rel@@ ap@@ se .
details did not want to mention a company spokesman on Friday .
it is still unclear who will conduct the market research company in the future .
&quot; in An@@ le@@ ger@@ kreis it was said on Friday , at the shareholders , the disappointment of the continuing success of the restructuring measures introduced years ago had been large . &quot;
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been working at the Gf@@ K @-@ summit since 2011 .
&quot; the fruits of the restructuring , however , are still not to be seen after 5 years , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in view of the last bad Gf@@ K business figures , every shareholder will eventually become un@@ steady at some point . &quot;
&quot; if that would be the case at BMW , that would also make the Qu@@ and@@ ts so , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; after set@@ backs in the preceding quarters , the company did not have to stop its losses in the second quarter of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; at € 36@@ 1.2 million , sales were 6.1 percent below the comparable period of the previous year . &quot;
sales in the first half of the year shr@@ ank by 3.4 percent to EUR 72@@ 1.2 million .
&quot; in view of its difficult economic situation , the company &apos;s lower value has bur@@ dened the profit in the second quarter owing to its difficult economic situation . &quot;
&quot; the Group &apos;s value depreci@@ ation , which has become necessary in the Consumer Experience division , had a loss of EUR 14@@ 8.2 million under the line . &quot;
&quot; in the second quarter of 2015 , the Gf@@ K generated a consolidated net profit of 19.@@ 7 million . &quot;
accidents - Bus sli@@ ps into cla@@ ws in cla@@ ws : eight injured
&quot; in an accident of a touring coach with 43 sen@@ iors as passengers , eight people were injured on Thursday in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ n ( district of Aur@@ ich ) . &quot;
&quot; two of the deta@@ inees suffered severe injuries , divided the police . &quot;
&quot; according to legend , the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to ev@@ ade an opposite vice , which drove partly on the counter @-@ road . &quot;
the bus came to the right from the street and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch like a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; due to the location of the bus , people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
the fire bri@@ gade liberated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and an emergency ambul@@ ance came to the accident scene on the provincial road 2 .
the injured travelers were brought back from a regular bus to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ ner quarter of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators asked the truck driver and potential witnesses to report to the police .
&quot; as of October 1 , 2016 , the fees per cubic metre of wastewater amount to 2.@@ 10 euros for the area of the sewage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ fare 3.@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 euros ( up to now 2.@@ 18 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the wastewater fee will then increase again at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are necessary . &quot;
&quot; after an over@@ dose calculation , the wastewater price in Az@@ la will then be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic metre . &quot;
&quot; as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , in the approval of the household by the District Office Kul@@ mb@@ ach , it was found that sub@@ coverings run for these sewage systems . &quot;
&quot; due to legal foundations , the market of Kas@@ endorf is obliged to operate the equipment cost @-@ effectively . &quot;
&quot; as of October 1 , 2016 , citizens and trade and industrial companies from Wel@@ fare , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to intervene more deeply into the pur@@ se . &quot;
the fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as Head of Administration Herbert Schmidt showed the committee , a new calculation of fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary . &quot;
&quot; in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - and under@@ wear from the previous calculation period were to be compensated . &quot;
Schmidt explained the serious fee increases that there are relatively small establishments with a very low waste water attack in all three sewage plants with a very low waste water attack which is between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic metres per year .
&quot; as a result of the low distribution basis , for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have serious effects . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the wastewater volume in all three plants is slightly declining . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , due to their age refurb@@ ishment and repair expenses , there was a significant increase in the underlying calculation period for all three plants . &quot;
&quot; the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the plants for Wel@@ fare , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced on the basis of a damage in the sewage plant in Az@@ endorf .
&quot; in the pumping station Wel@@ fare , the almost 20 years old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led from the ground up and the first sewage pond had to be dissip@@ ated after nearly 20 years , the sewage slu@@ dge disposed of and an additional ventilation facility had to be installed in order to comply with the water @-@ legal requirements in the future . &quot;
Schmidt : &quot; these extraordinary expenses resulted in the continued supervision and maintenance costs that have to be taken into account in the new calculation period .
&quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which were significantly below the current level during the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 . &quot;
stone houses made it clear that in the low waste water supply in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance were completely sm@@ ashed .
&quot; in doing so , Schmidt , the market community of major entertainment costs in the wastewater facilities in the past 20 years , has been spar@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; after the view of stone houses , the situation for the mentioned plants will continue to remain prec@@ arious , especially since the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ en@@ ba@@ cht@@ al sewage @-@ purpose association could not be extended because it is a deficit . &quot;
Bulgaria books inflation for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year as positive 0.2 % .
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
&quot; the consumer price index compared to June 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % . &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
&quot; in July 2016 , a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods was observed compared to the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; transportation ( 1.8 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices fell in clothing and shoes ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices remained as in the pre @-@ month with alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; flats , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged . &quot;
Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect is critici@@ zed as Asian car@@ ic@@ ature
&quot; snap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say that it is in@@ sensitive to races . &quot;
&quot; with its filtering tool , Snap@@ chat allows around 150 million daily users to change the reality and to play with identi@@ ties in such a way that already borders the absurd . &quot;
&quot; you can transform yourself into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting . &quot;
&quot; the filters are bl@@ ended , self @-@ rotating tools that generate more than 30 million improved sel@@ fies per day . &quot;
all mis@@ steps arrive to the public .
&quot; snap@@ chat filters have drawn criticism in the past , in which they were charged that the app would promote black face promoting or white skin as a beauty ideal . &quot;
&quot; as this week some users suggested a filter which gave them sl@@ otted eyes , false teeth and blo@@ ated che@@ eks , some critics called a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; Yellow @-@ face . &quot; &quot;
they wondered if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a larger problem that the company has diversity .
&quot; the news and ou@@ trage were widely distributed on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mot@@ her@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat announced that it would have disabled the feature . &quot;
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was designed as homage to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced racism reminded the filter of hur@@ ting c@@ lich@@ és .
others rejected the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose twe@@ ets were widely spread over the photos , was that the filter was &quot; hur@@ t@@ ful &quot; and said to be unpleasant . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgu@@ sting Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and filter effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ si@@ ghted , but that the yellow face has been pulled into the proj@@ ecting extreme . &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural tri@@ vi@@ ate .
&quot; American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand . &quot;
and snap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people - who are more different in terms of race than their older counterpart - could be more likely to expect sensitivity .
&quot; when one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters creates a picture that is insul@@ ting for a user , &quot; &quot; it is much more difficult that such things remain un@@ noticed when it was earlier , &quot; &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who worked as Product Manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete her snapshot account , asked others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview , she said she believes that racial @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the settings of Snap@@ chat . &quot;
Z@@ hu also critici@@ zed the large part white and only male leadership and ended her essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no representation of people with other skin colors in their staff so they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable in order to say something about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their mind , a complaint that has left Snap@@ chat largely un@@ answered . &quot;
the company does not publish any numbers on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
&quot; on Thursday , Snap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural background of its employees , but according to a subscri@@ ber , the company recently recru@@ ited a personnel officer who focuses on sub @-@ represented population groups and on internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu also said they will leave their Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
military leadership distor@@ ts IS@@ IS intelligence intelligence agencies dis@@ sem@@ bles Congress of Congress
&quot; military personnel of the United States Central Command turned out intelligence information to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , as it would have allowed the actual conditions on site , reported an investigation committee of the Congress in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of Repub@@ lican Members of the Military Committee , Secret Service Com@@ mittees and the Defense Organ@@ izing Committee , reports of great dis@@ content among Central Command Intelligence analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; central Command , short cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , that controls U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; intelligence information , which was typically done by high @-@ ranking Cent@@ Com com@@ man@@ ders , regularly recorded a more positive image of the American efforts against terrorism as the actual states were allowed on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; &quot; published a newspaper article . &quot;
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; stated Ken Cal@@ vert , repub@@ lican member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives . &quot;
the management errors in the Cent@@ com range up to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report highlights detailed problems during the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
&quot; although there is no direct evidence suggest@@ ing that governmental peaks have given instructions under Obama to change the reports , it shows how analysts exposed the pressure from their superi@@ ors , a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command Press releases , statements and statements in front of the congress were clearly more positive than the facts presented . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ Com member publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could begin in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ ul , second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigation , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Repub@@ lican Con@@ gres@@ sman from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the leaders of Central Command have changed the intelligence reports to down@@ play the danger of IS@@ IS in Iraq . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans called the Task Force to live after being admitted that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings while the investigations will continue .
&quot; in addition , the Cent@@ Com reports are under way through the Chief In@@ spec@@ tor of the Ministry of Defence . &quot;
democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday that coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Repub@@ lican task force .
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , the Cent@@ Com has created an over@@ ly restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; announced the highest ranking demo@@ crat in the committee , member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives Adam B. Schiff , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; this process , so Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; accused the morality of analysts and &quot; gave too little room for dis@@ sent@@ ing opinions . &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no clu@@ e to the intervention of the White House at Cent@@ Com analysts in terms of a &quot; definite political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the proceedings of the Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon general inspec@@ tor who received after complaints by Cent@@ Com analysts . &quot;
&quot; C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokesman , admitted that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the reports of the Congress , while the inspec@@ tors were still under way . &quot;
&quot; but he also indicated that &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ ging opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defence welcomed a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot;
the investigations also have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful air campaign under US leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that has meanwhile been made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
&quot; however , the accus@@ ations of last year raised the question to what extent President Obama can rely on the Central Command for an honest assessment of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State ev@@ oked the inter@@ activity of more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , had written a written document about how the former government under George W. Bush had only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the insurrection against current reporting on the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team led Mr. Hoo@@ ker , according to government officials , that contrary to the statements of the government air@@ strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State , no significant impact on the terrorist group &apos;s financial situation could have been , as these prohi@@ bitions would have been put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; this knowledge , however , was not published , the Times reported in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ re@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critici@@ zed by members of the legislature because of his over@@ ly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
general Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel at Central Command .
&quot; United States winning fourth match in the hockey of women , a show@@ down with Britain is ahead &quot;
K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she couldn &apos;t remember that ever done . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their goals in mind .
&quot; however , they know : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are in their group with the Brit@@ ons on the first place , which will remain unbe@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter@@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group . &quot;
the first placed will go a little longer on the strong Dutch woman who will lead the other group .
&quot; as always , the game will go out on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising vor@@ ti@@ ces through their success story , four years after they landed in the last London Games on the last of 12 places . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and for the first time with three years she had played a hockey player ( her two older sisters played the Sport at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became National Player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
she missed the Olympics in 2008 because she couldn &apos;t qualify for the cad@@ re .
&quot; then came the year 2012 , in which everything went wrong for her and her team . &quot;
&quot; in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the national team , began to turn things into a better . &quot;
&quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; B@@ am said . &quot;
we didn &apos;t have the work@@ load in London that we now have .
we can rip the ru@@ dder completely .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the Tor@@ rei@@ gen in the first half of the game with a back@@ lash out of the local area .
&quot; India had gone into the game without victory , but the team showed itself surprisingly tough and held the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands . &quot;
&quot; she performed a spr@@ int with the flat ball on the left flan@@ k , then pulled into the middle and kno@@ cked the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the US go@@ al@@ keeper , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games . &quot;
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the tramp@@ ol@@ ines &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , how late it is , it is the Olympics . &quot;
&quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro feel steady and inevitable , a rapid relay between competition and aspir@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod , which is passed from the cross@@ bow to s@@ wimm@@ ers to the gym@@ n@@ ast for tri@@ athletes . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t turn on TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor &apos;s conversation in the coffee shop , without hearing Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a s@@ warm of women with dimples , could well have been among these known names that would be sent to Prime Time , set up by sponsors and well @-@ being TV advertising , if he would be a swi@@ mmer , gym@@ n@@ ast or even fen@@ cers . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights gold in the olymp@@ ic tramp@@ ol@@ ines . &quot;
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
&quot; further from the center , partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally accepted : pist@@ ol shooting , ar@@ cher@@ y , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the breast swim and may rule it for a long time .
&quot; but if I have a modest argument for my particular favourite , then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline . &quot;
&quot; although the trampoline bed has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , it was so spar@@ se the last 16 years that many who asked me did not know that it was an Olympic sport at all . &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the USA sent athletes to compete , it has never won a medal in the trampoline jumping and until 2012 had had an athlete , who made it to the final round . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians are inclined to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
&quot; the jumping on the trampoline has a certain out@@ sider character , partly because it sounds suitable for the un@@ enlightened ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ schule as the one for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a dev@@ out enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has hum@@ orous potential - the carto@@ on@@ ical trem@@ bling of his never @-@ ending boun@@ ce - but also the grace of gymnas@@ tics and do@@ ve , the two sports that essentially unite . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline which means as much as the spring@@ board . &quot;
&quot; asp@@ iring champi@@ ons jump on a giant trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to land a series of falling movements ( turning , cock and sal@@ ts ) before they land on their feet . &quot;
&quot; according to the official Olympic programme , they are assessed according to version , difficulty level and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio . &quot;
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
&quot; med@@ alli@@ sts in their quest for gold continue to go faster , up and down , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes up and down , up and down at the playground . &quot;
&quot; they hunt not only the finish line or the original wall , but also another high goal in the television broadcast : the world or the Olympi@@ ad . &quot;
&quot; the goal @-@ oriented pursuit is no@@ bel , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ atic - and it &apos;s enough to even touch a spect@@ ator with tears . &quot;
but it &apos;s also what I feel fati@@ gu@@ ed when watching these games .
the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward motion is not the goal .
&quot; he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then effort@@ lessly upward . &quot;
&quot; there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity . &quot;
it &apos;s as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can be .
&quot; the qualification and final rounds of the women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13@@ .00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13@@ .00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the end @-@ hours as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14@@ .00 .
&quot; in the midst of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably overlooked in general tur@@ mo@@ il . &quot;
&quot; if the rise of consciousness can only be achieved by the fear and the obj@@ ec@@ tification of male athletes - as the male US Tur@@ ner suggested recently , Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his new fan base to return to air . &quot;
&quot; a generation protests &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the USA &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators calling for political changes in Ethiopia were hit by the government &apos;s violent resistance .
witnesses say that dozens of prot@@ esters were killed during the clas@@ hes with the police at gun@@ shot .
is Ethiopia just collap@@ sing ?
&quot; in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries of Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy . &quot;
&quot; but over the past few months , protests against the government troubled the country and spread to more and more areas . &quot;
last week thousands of people stor@@ med down the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
&quot; according to human rights organisations , the government &apos;s response was ruth@@ less . &quot;
witnesses stated that polic@@ emen shot and killed on ump@@ teen un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; circul@@ ating videos on the protests , which are probably from the last or early of this year , show how security people hit young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand@@ stand against a wall . &quot;
the head of the UN Human Rights Council now demands a detailed investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Cris@@ is Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West .
&quot; American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to combat terrorism across the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , receive so much Western help . &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
&quot; the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted , with dissi@@ dents effectively sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; many were sent into exile or in prison , killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; if you supp@@ ress people and have no other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in central Ethiop@@ ian . &quot;
the whole youth protests .
a generation protests .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from the use of land to stran@@ gle@@ hold with regard to the power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; following a widely critici@@ zed election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , tensions continue along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line challenged hundreds of lives in June . &quot;
&quot; analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of O@@ ga@@ den , which have been forced more or less in recent years , exploit the turbul@@ ence and arm themselves again . &quot;
several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness can now explo@@ de under the surface .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
&quot; only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate through the social media , as cheaper smartphones have become increasingly common and improved Internet services . &quot;
&quot; even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter , doing what it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people still can communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians gave an indication that they were so prot@@ esting .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia . &quot;
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; for e@@ ons of e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who mainly come from Ethiopia , prosp@@ ered in politics and the economy , while they exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , many of whom are Muslims and living in low@@ land areas . &quot;
but that also changes .
&quot; we are coordin@@ ating under a umbrella , &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot;
the biggest protests took place in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is un@@ fairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which accounts for about 6 per cent of the population and dominant in the military , secret services , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , had until his death on a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed illness in 2012 17 years of Ethiop@@ ian prime minister . &quot;
&quot; he was regarded as a tactical genius , a man who could think around corners . &quot;
analysts say that he was particularly well vers@@ ed in recognizing early signs of dis@@ content and using special officers to process opponents and to make them harmless .
&quot; the current regime lacks this basic skill , &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively un@@ transparent reasons to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south . &quot;
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time that Ethiopia was experiencing such a uph@@ eav@@ al in 2005 , after thousands of poll@@ s prot@@ ested , according to analysts , apparently stolen by the government and then stolen . &quot;
&quot; during the ensu@@ ing ra@@ ids many prot@@ esters were killed , even if there were less than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest passed relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; the development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , and for their measurable progress in poverty allevi@@ ation . &quot;
but obviously this did not hin@@ der the intensi@@ fication of the internal res@@ ent@@ ment of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it accepts a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; last month , prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ per@@ sian city , attacked by Tig@@ ray and the hatred towards the Tig@@ ray becomes more and more common in the social media . &quot;
analysts say that the protests will bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flug to the neighboring Somalia , even if it recently announced that it closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West wants to support democracy clearly , he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile region . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; is a very thin ti@@ ght@@ rope walk . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his claim Obama had founded IS@@ IS was &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
&quot; Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to disp@@ el the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his multiple repeated claim , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton were the &quot; founders &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not serious . &quot;
&quot; this clari@@ fication raised new questions about the communication skills of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , whether he was able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public . &quot;
&quot; it also brings out its comrades who endeav@@ our to take protection during an event@@ ful phase , into the peculiar position to explain statements that he could not have meant . &quot;
&quot; having done the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump with@@ drew in terms of the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to interpret , the president and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS . &quot;
but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was just sar@@ c@@ astic .
&quot; the twe@@ et was the opposite to the previous day , where Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation was completely serious . &quot;
&quot; when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help Mr. Tr@@ ump to weak@@ en the statement by rec@@ alling that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate did not want to know about it . &quot;
the last storm of criticism sne@@ aks down on Mr. Tr@@ ump while trying to steer the focus of his campaign on account of falling survey values on the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton kept talking about the economic situation in Mich@@ ig@@ an this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump again tried to return to this subject again .
&quot; using Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their words boring . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
&quot; at the end of July he felt strong criticism when he said that the Russians were to h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but later he explained &quot; &quot; Of course I thought the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic boundaries in politics and then return to demand .
&quot; I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans as they arrive , and then , if necessary , &quot; clarify &quot; according to how the reaction drops . &quot; said Ruth sher@@ man , a communication expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; however , I believe he is clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump assumed an even more corro@@ sive tone as his survey values declined further . &quot;
&quot; a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a great lead in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tr@@ ump generally tries not to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he frequently acc@@ uses his critics of distor@@ ting his statements or mis@@ understanding his humour . &quot;
&quot; but while he focuses on the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ ump@@ eter Scher@@ ze have brought his loyal companions into the uncomfortable situation of having to stand to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ antly his statements may be . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Gi@@ uli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ ump &apos;s most prominent advoc@@ ates , tried to defend the candidate in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comment@@ aries , &quot; Mr. Gi@@ uli@@ ani said he was questioned about Mr. Tr@@ umps &apos;s statements , whether Mr. Obama and Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that before Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization he called it rear @-@ hang@@ ers , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most mainstream Repub@@ lic@@ ans are trying to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State , allowed IS@@ IS to spread the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively under control . &quot;
&quot; before the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of being ro@@ using against him on each of his words . &quot;
&quot; he mo@@ cked the poor , miserable &quot; TV experts trying to understand him and said , &quot; You can &apos;t ! . &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats ridi@@ cul@@ ed Mr. Tr@@ ump &apos;s excuse as just another proof that he was un@@ fit for the presi@@ dency .
&quot; once upon the price of the market , Café in Green@@ point returns &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a coffee shop in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi but served good coffee for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue store front were sup@@ planted . &quot;
&quot; So@@ ap Cher@@ ie business , replacing the verb in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes . &quot;
indigenous people used it as the last loss in a genetically modified city .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ inger wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
&quot; but if New York is change , then it is also re @-@ invention . &quot;
&quot; a revi@@ ved verb Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere . &quot;
coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old cafes , the owner and managing director of the new café . &quot;
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
&quot; when a client offered to provide funds for a new branch office , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot . &quot;
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els bought the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same lights from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
&quot; on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bacon and cheese , and there are gar@@ n@@ ishes such as cap@@ ers and sau@@ ced onions . &quot;
there are natural rice dishes .
&quot; the café serves no more beer , but there are fresh juices . &quot;
&quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers . &quot;
&quot; many old customers were also pushed by prices from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; recently , on a Sunday , Rebe@@ cca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer . &quot;
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg in former times and visited the club regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after she moved to Green@@ point , she would take the path . &quot;
&quot; after the verb closed , she gave up a cup of coffee for a while , she said . &quot;
&quot; it was clear to me that it was about coffee and culture in the club that I liked , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now she drinks coffee again , even though she ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coffee , which is another new addition . &quot;
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a loyal customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003 .
he went there before work and inv@@ ari@@ ably ordered the same .
&quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said . &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients in the menu .
&quot; nowadays Ros@@ enthal is still getting his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with bacon , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he didn &apos;t win a gru@@ dge about the fact that the soap business took the old business space .
&quot; in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered a special soap for verb with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of the café as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go on her offer , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional , Polish inhabitants Green@@ points have also accepted the café . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he preten@@ ded to exhibit them soon , so that his new neighbors will feel welcome . &quot;
the location also has other advantages .
local juice local wants to fill and sell the cold bre@@ wed coffee .
there is a chance that the café expands to an adjacent building .
&quot; for many customers , a new verb is enough to get their old favour@@ ites . &quot;
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed on the ground when the cafe closed .
&quot; when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee was felt like a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a rich meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his rise to the President , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roos@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
&quot; as a gourmet , President Roos@@ ev@@ elt had a fai@@ ble for refined delic@@ acy of Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water tur@@ tle soup . &quot;
&quot; its menu on that day was somewhat more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , potato pu@@ ree and as dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Bri@@ ck@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how to eat them . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
&quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; was about Chinese cuisine in the USA , while brick was told in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from the food perspective . &quot;
&quot; her latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will be published on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity as they meet with a re@@ porter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; brick , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive rolls , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with potato pur@@ ée and vegetable mixture ate . &quot;
&quot; when the re@@ porter ordered Hack@@ ers , this found the couple appropriate for a discussion about food in the era of Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; &quot; said Bri@@ ck@@ man . &quot;
&quot; there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread . &quot;
they were prepared from an ingredient and some cheap that stretches the ingredient .
imagine eating so many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ inning .
&quot; it must have settled in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an All @-@ You Can E@@ at Buffet . &quot;
&quot; teams of women cooked for male fel@@ lows and it was served freshly baked p@@ ate for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; records the ways in which the country was surrounded by no longer the land of land . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when food for the Americans became a central , ten@@ se theme , &quot; Co@@ e explained why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; the new budget was just as ten@@ se : mysterious food such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es became stap@@ le food , the K@@ asser@@ ol@@ le re@@ gained as a &quot; &quot; wonderful way to re@@ use food resi@@ dues , &quot; &quot; said Bri@@ ck@@ man , as coo@@ ks could hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a creamy sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dr@@ y@@ wall .
&quot; meat , which was the center of American cuisine for many years , became a rare ser@@ ene luxury . &quot;
&quot; strange mixtures were tried , as a calorie @-@ rich and nutri@@ tious satisfaction prevailed over taste or even wholes@@ ome kitchen sense . &quot;
&quot; during their research for the book , which also includes recipes , brick was made from this period , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular addition to lunch , &quot; Co@@ e says . &quot;
&quot; Ziegel@@ man continues : &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions don &apos;t fit together .
it was typical for many of the house recipes .
&quot; as never before or ever since , budget econom@@ ists - among them Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - have der@@ ailed eating habits of the country . &quot;
&quot; by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; house@@ keepers &quot; and the challenge of converting P@@ amp@@ e like creamy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a feast of historical treats .
&quot; in particular , the reports of the government &apos;s response to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ Cake @-@ Essen @-@ attitude . &quot;
&quot; while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa Far@@ ming cuisine of his kitchen , he spoke like the million @-@ million man of the world he has become . &quot;
&quot; he liked Continental cuisine as fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
he ate in an almost gilt dining room and wore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was a real stranger to reality .
&quot; President Roos@@ ev@@ elt might have committed the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to make an example with his stomach . &quot;
&quot; as described in the book , the hypo@@ cris@@ y of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors of Ms Roos@@ ev@@ elt suggested that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most controversial . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression that deal with food was dis@@ car@@ ded as soon as the country returned to the legs .
&quot; the legacy lies on our continued focus on calories and food , said Bri@@ ck@@ man , as well as how science was applied to food . &quot;
the couple admitted to the writing of the book the eating habits of Ziegel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law better understood - for example how they could not throw away food .
&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
&quot; brick was rec@@ alled , &quot; &quot; They really made people sick . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the wind@@ shield .
&quot; after the plates were removed from Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e produced a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert that President Roos@@ ev@@ elt ate at lunch . &quot;
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man , and added that it was a common trick to give modest recipes a chic name . &quot;
&quot; there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
&quot; each di@@ ved somewhat reluct@@ antly , a spoon in the t@@ amed , brown Gli@@ b@@ ber . &quot;
amaz@@ ingly it did not taste bad .
Co@@ E got three times a supplement .
&quot; like a Can @-@ Do Bud@@ get@@ ter , he said to his wife , &quot; Some chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
killed in bomb attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died even in a barrel bomb attack of the Assad regime .
&quot; O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil protection group that , according to Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved almost 60@@ ,000 people life . &quot;
29@@ 00 volunteers put their own life on the game to draw people from bom@@ bed houses and to help in the war area first aid .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
&quot; O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the civil guard , showing him during a 11 @-@ hour rescue of an infant from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 . &quot;
it made the Syri@@ ans a shining symbol figure in the horror of war .
&quot; but as a hero he never saw himself , he said al@@ oud : &quot; for me this is true ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I die , I think God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot;
&quot; shortly before O@@ mar himself attacked an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bombing ra@@ ids in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the helicop@@ ters have dropped four barrel bombs over the Al@@ z@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlorine gas . &quot;
&quot; a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from lack of breath . &quot;
&quot; we now eliminate the toxic rem@@ nants of the bomb , so that not children play with it , &quot; the picture c@@ ites his final words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest verteb@@ ra@@ e is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland hair usually occurs only in winter to the surface .
&quot; after an investigation on board of the S@@ anna , this shar@@ k was allowed to go back to the sea . &quot;
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks get offspring with 150 years of age .
&quot; lei@@ surely , the Greenland shar@@ k is floating along the bottom of the North Atlantic , at an hour it reaches just 1,@@ 220 metres . &quot;
&quot; only when it matters , the five @-@ metre @-@ long animal acceler@@ ates at a height of 2.6 km / h and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed . &quot;
&quot; this lifestyle , characterized by slow@@ ness , seems to be a god@@ parent for a high age . &quot;
&quot; Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science , &quot; at least one Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ hai who could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; ma@@ dness , &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein of the Max @-@ Planck @-@ Institute for Dem@@ ographic Research in Rostock , this life span , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot;
the evolutionary bi@@ ologist suspected that Greenland &apos;s hair would be a stone age .
only the evidence was missing .
&quot; Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks are hard to observe , after all , they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear only in the winter on the surface . &quot;
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland &apos;s hair .
their slow motion measured them when they equipped six animals with a transmitter from S@@ val@@ bard .
&quot; nevertheless , prey makes this sh@@ arks : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear . &quot;
&quot; they may hunt dor@@ man@@ t animals or pat@@ rol on the bottom of the ice cream , looking for cad@@ aver , which tor@@ ches from higher water layers . &quot;
&quot; Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues investigated 28 Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depths of the North Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long , while the biggest 50@@ 2 cen@@ timeter . &quot;
&quot; in order to determine the age of the animals , they analysed the lens core of the sh@@ arks with the carbon @-@ 14 method . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eye lens is already born before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained therein will no longer be renewed . &quot;
the two smallest sh@@ arks had notably much carbon @-@ 14 in the lens core .
&quot; therefore , after the early 1960s , their birth should lie as a nuclear weapon hunt larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in the third smallest animal with 220 centimet@@ ers in length , the l@@ enti@@ cular nucleus , on the other hand , contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the atomic weapons , so it should have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , all larger Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts in their l@@ enti@@ cular nucleus , resulting from cosmic rays in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock showed an age of 3@@ 35 years for a 4@@ 93 centimet@@ re long Greenland shar@@ k , while the record shar@@ k might be 3@@ 92 years old at 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; only then , if they are longer than four meters , Greenland @-@ shar@@ k @-@ females have been known . &quot;
&quot; now , the researchers were able to assign an age to the length . &quot;
&quot; since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ res probably stood on the threshold of sexually mature and its age was determined 156 years ago , Greenland &apos;s hair with the increase obviously can be at least one and a half centuries of time . &quot;
this is also likely to be a world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ em@@ es live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence .
&quot; the previous record holder , a 2@@ 11 @-@ year @-@ old Greenland whale , whose bacon at the neck was a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ poon tip , was caught before Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there often runs on spar@@ ring flames . &quot;
so they mature later - and age more slowly .
&quot; in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals often become particularly large . &quot;
&quot; because the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal loses heat . &quot;
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than at one gram of elephant .
another advantage : they have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives therefore more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many offspring as possible as possible , &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot;
&quot; a very big animal , on the other hand , should rather invest his resources into a long life . &quot;
building site in double pack
&quot; in the recent meeting , the Council of Ministers has focuss@@ ed on issues relating to building . &quot;
&quot; with relief , the panel conven@@ ed the announcement of Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; at last , the marketing of recently designated residential areas can begin . &quot; &quot;
&quot; after the land , plot and settlement questions were clari@@ fied and the applications for sur@@ veying could be clari@@ fied , the sale of the plots in the residential areas &quot; &quot; Straß@@ l@@ weg &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Schö@@ nau @-@ West &quot; &quot; ( area of Bin@@ der@@ straße - Sel@@ ection section 1 ) no longer stands in the way . &quot;
the Municipal Council is convinced that the construction areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schö@@ nau are appealing to young families and other sen@@ iors equally .
&quot; as it was said , construction will@@ s can report immediately in the town hall , and the municipal council is expected to advise on the allocation of the plots in its September meeting . &quot;
&quot; the municipal council decided to am@@ end the land use plan , which was newly created in the spring of this year , in order to establish new commercial enterprises , in addition to the creation of jobs . &quot;
&quot; in the area of Unter@@ zeit@@ lar@@ n , the business area already proven there will be extended by two par@@ c@@ els in the direction of state road 2@@ 112 . &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
&quot; according to the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg , the city on the Main has the best opportunities to attract new jobs and companies from London . &quot;
&quot; it is highly prob@@ able that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Bre@@ x@@ it vote , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of the I@@ W competence field , financial markets and real estate markets . &quot;
&quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether cash houses will continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot;
&quot; so far , it is sufficient for the so @-@ called EU passport to be approved in the UK . &quot;
that &apos;s what big US banks are using .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
&quot; the lob@@ b@@ ying association &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; reck@@ ons with 10,000 new jobs in the Main within five years . &quot;
&quot; for Frankfurt , such as the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the euro area , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance review E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk ratio ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its head office , but it is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks , as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; Luxembourg had a big fund sector , but also cut off at the infrastructure as well as Dublin . &quot;
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the big airport .
&quot; in addition , the city has light commercial properties available . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , it is not easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; on the Seine , the rent for first @-@ class commercial real estate is 50 percent higher than in the Main . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and less crime . &quot;
&quot; in a ranking of the management consultancy Mer@@ cer , the city on position 7 , Luxembourg in place 19 , Dublin is ranked # 33 and Paris in 3@@ 7th place . &quot;
&quot; even if quality of life is a question of preferences : &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European single market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; the I@@ W concludes . &quot;
&quot; but despite Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe , my economic researchers . &quot;
&quot; the correlation of forces : in London according to the figures of the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba , about 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry at the end of 2015 , in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2,500 . &quot;
Gilead gets legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a US rec@@ ti@@ fier ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to the reimbur@@ sement of legal costs arising from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ se C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
&quot; in June , Gilead was liberated from a claim for damages amoun@@ ting to $ 200 million for the violation of two patents from Mer@@ ck , which in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge uncovered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including the per@@ jury and other un@@ ethical acts . &quot;
&quot; when the law@@ suit was filed on Thursday , US Secretary Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to the expense incurred during the defense of the case . &quot;
&quot; Mer@@ ck is trying to equ@@ ate Gilead to the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines , which can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease . &quot;
&quot; the case goes back to 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck lay claim to each other and claim ownership in laboratory work , the Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ ckle underground , the active ingredient in the medicines of Gilead . &quot;
troops supported by the United States say that they have re@@ conquered complete control over Man@@ bi@@ j by the Islamic State
&quot; the United States supported the full control over the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border , after the last IS fighters in the city left them , said a group spokesman on Friday . &quot;
&quot; the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) are craw@@ ling after the extract of the remaining group of fighters who have dig@@ ged themselves within the city , currently the city . &quot;

clin@@ tons earn 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton announced on Friday its tax return for 2015 , which resulted in the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , Clinton &apos;s USD 1 million donated USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; the former Secretary of State Bill Clinton received an income of USD 3 million from Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster publishing house for her book about her term in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s candidate for the Vice @-@ Pres@@ i@@ dency , Senator Tim ka@@ ine from Virginia , published his tax returns of the last ten years together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton . &quot;
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; admitted Clinton &apos;s campaign assistant J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump is hiding behind false exc@@ uses and re@@ trac@@ ers regarding his previous promises to publish his tax returns . &quot;
&quot; it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns , although they are not obliged to do so by law . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers , as the reason for his refusal , have indicated a tax audit by the tax authorities . &quot;
&quot; they are on the move , &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s election campaign hel@@ per Ian S@@ ams on Twitter , referring to the release of the democr@@ ats &quot; presidential candidate . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ ump &apos;s Special Ad@@ visor , said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to release anything before the tax inspections were not completed . &quot;
&quot; critics , including the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate of 2012 , Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal questions in relation to assets , his donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business relations and various other connections , especially with Russia . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has already top@@ pled the issue and released a video on the Internet on Friday , in which high @-@ ranking Repub@@ lican Tr@@ ump asks to publish his tax return . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , she spoke on the subject during a speech about the economy in Mich@@ ig@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in recent decades , and to publish his tax returns . &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot;
&quot; politi@@ co announced that during the 1990s Tr@@ ump has paid no or very little tax for two years , and a business journalist of the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ers on Friday , claiming that this could still be the case . &quot;
federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett who would ensure that individuals who earn more than USD 1 million deserve a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka last week , Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial glomer@@ ate took his seat here , took Tr@@ ump into a meeting to exchange their tax returns . &quot;
Buff@@ ett said he was also subjected to a tax audit of the I@@ RS and Tr@@ ump got &quot; fear &quot; from the elec@@ tors and not from the tax authorities .
Clinton &apos;s campaign has released tax return until 2007 .
&quot; on average , the Clin@@ tons living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an effective federal tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , Clinton &apos;s tax returns showed that only USD 100 of their income were paid as a reward , unlike most Americans . &quot;
&quot; their main investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund , from which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and proceeds were tax@@ ed by USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 . &quot;

con@@ doms with Ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der ; fire@@ work bodies promote Tanz@@ ani@@ as elephant protection
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going to settlements inhabited by people - they throw con@@ doms on them that are filled with ci@@ lia powder .
&quot; the method proved to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , who had already had the idea , intensified its promotion together with the US natural protection , by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania , using a non @-@ violent four @-@ stage method to protect their homes and crops without viol@@ ating animals . &quot;
&quot; before that , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves . &quot;
Friday is the world telephone day dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the ... tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change in their attitudes within these communities , whereby they are more confident that they can keep the eleph@@ ants from their fields without har@@ ming the elephant in doing so , &quot; said the Managing Director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message . &quot;
the first two steps include the light of the elephant with a torch and the bubbles in a horn .
&quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Chi@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot;
&quot; mix the mixture with the earth together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , whose end is turned to the ignition line . &quot;
&quot; when lit , the con@@ dom bur@@ sts with a pop and spark@@ les fine dust in the air . &quot;
a breath is usually already out to chase the elephant .
&quot; a last possibility is a shi@@ py@@ ard , which shoots a gold fire fire@@ work in the air , causing a loud , bright explosion . &quot;
city council unanim@@ ously agrees : no ki@@ osk building at St. Go@@ ar@@ er Rhein@@ u@@ fer
&quot; normally , the St. Go@@ ar@@ er investment projects of tra@@ des@@ people with K@@ us@@ sh@@ and assume - particularly the retail trade in the core capital is considered to be considerably exp@@ and@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the City Council , however , rejected the request for the new construction of a sales ski on the Rhine river in the immediate vicinity of the Rhein@@ bal@@ kon@@ s , which is currently under construction . &quot;
&quot; in general , we welcome new tra@@ des@@ people , but at this location in exposed position on the bank of the Rhine , this ki@@ osk is not suitable , &quot; &quot; stated Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U faction . &quot;
Jewish director dis@@ integrates Berlin &apos;s hotel because Israeli pre @-@ election was removed after the &quot; Arab &quot; request - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media clock after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli pres@@ election as it would have requested Arab guests according to an employee .
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of Holocaust Docum@@ entation &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the country &apos;s list of countries . &quot;
&quot; however , the country was not listed among the countries which can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel has been eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
he wrote Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ inski Hotel B@@ rist@@ ol offers a possibility to select Israel via its own call center . &quot;
&quot; after an explanation , the director contacted the hotel reception . &quot;
&quot; the answer he received there , &quot; attracted him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the hotel staff stated that the measure was an &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot;
the reason behind this was even more fur@@ ious in the director .
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is er@@ ased , &quot; &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann was quoted . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great dis@@ grace , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and shocked by this event .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has taken place in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even greater shame .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; the incident triggered a rather large resonance on the internet , in which people called the whole thing a scandal . &quot;
some of them presented the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that there would have been the alleged &quot; re@@ for@@ estation of Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; shame you , &quot; &quot; he said in another post , in which it was pointed out that the hotel , which is located on the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is near a synagogue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly dismissed all alle@@ gations and called the incident a &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct instruction to &quot; not record Israel into the quick selection list , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung cited a spokesman of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
it adds that the country code has now been added .
police puts tear gas &amp; rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
&quot; on Thursday , students met with the police in Sa@@ o Paulo , Brazil , when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system . &quot;
the police put tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; the difficulties began , as police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , which led to the police inspec@@ ting rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas . &quot;
several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation on the plans .
&quot; according to the Gover@@ nor of the Federal State of Sa@@ o Paulo Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min , some less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are implemented to save money . &quot;
some of the prot@@ esters have seen gra@@ ff@@ iti against preliminary President Michel Tem@@ er to spray on walls .
&quot; the recent protests took place several days after demonstr@@ ators went to the streets in crowds to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been removed from office by a vote of the Senate . &quot;
trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trade turnover between Moscow and Teher@@ an grew by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , the interest in Russian companies has grown strongly in the country , distributed the am@@ bass@@ adors . &quot;
Russian companies are taking existing connections with Iran while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; of course , further trade expansion is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot;
&quot; he noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran rose by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent in the first five months of 2016 , compared to the same period in 2015 and was $ 8@@ 56 million . &quot;
&quot; in particular , Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the trade boom was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot;
&quot; for this year , D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan goes out of a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia . &quot;
&quot; last year , the Russian Foreign Repres@@ entative issued around 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , primarily travel visa , to Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Iran reached the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year were broken , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something that the ambassador expects that it will change . &quot;
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d to have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said . &quot;
witnesses sought : beverage market falling into Wald@@ br@@ öl
a rob@@ ber@@ y attack on Thursday evening on the beverage market of Re@@ we XXL was perpet@@ rated at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
&quot; under the support of a fire@@ arm , three dark @-@ dressed persons who had m@@ um@@ med their faces were the issuing of cash from the staff of the drink bar and then fled first on foot and then probably with a silver @-@ colored VW Golf . &quot;
&quot; how much money was captured , the police did not share . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ators should have been between 1,@@ 60 and 1,@@ 70 meters tall , so relatively small . &quot;
the beverage market is directly accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market and is poorly visible .
&quot; the perpetr@@ ators must be sc@@ anned in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and be wing@@ ed from the gravel car park situated opposite the car park entrance , possibly in the direction of B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) . &quot;
&quot; who made observations at the time of the crime ( at 19.@@ 45 o &apos;clock ) , which are related to the rob@@ ber@@ y , should urgently report to the police . &quot;
Nag@@ old : playing and fun at the time of summer
&quot; eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the Social Pe@@ dago@@ gical Day Group / Social group work of the child protection federation Nag@@ old with their car@@ ers on their summer break in Nuss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er . &quot;
&quot; during the first school holiday week , the joyful group was lod@@ ged in the secluded leisure area of Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle . &quot;
several full day trips were on the agenda .
&quot; on the one hand , it went to B@@ loo@@ dy with the visit of the pet@@ ting zoo . &quot;
&quot; to the other , to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guide in the world @-@ famous monastery . &quot;
the third excursion led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
&quot; in the Celtic Museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about everyday life and the food of the Cel@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; on the hot days , the group gathered at the Tiefen@@ see in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invited for jumping , swimming and plan@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; children and car@@ ers with their own prepared pastries , such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ er Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ Breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese were treated to culinary delights . &quot;
&quot; workshops were cur@@ ated , beautiful jewellery made of pearls and stones or made of wood a Roman mill game . &quot;
&quot; further highlights of the free time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; Bun@@ te E@@ ven@@ ing . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the day of departure , the sun was laugh@@ ed and the children and young people returned . &quot;
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the gates of mercy
the ministers from the pastoral care unit Ey@@ oc@@ al @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way to Freiburg on the way to Freiburg .
&quot; together , four stages were accomplished . &quot;
&quot; in order to bridge the time to the next Roman@@ esque pilgrimage of all the regi@@ stran@@ ts in two years , the Minister for Foreign Affairs of St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; various pilgrimage destinations were examined and one finally decided to visit the Ep@@ is@@ cop@@ al City of Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , a special pilgrimage destination was offered at Frei@@ burger Münster . &quot;
&quot; 16 Min@@ is , out of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , and Gru@@ ol , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and the holy rooms went their way . &quot;
&quot; in the evening before , Pastor Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgri@@ m crosses and shared the pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; from Hor@@ b we drove by train to the starting point of Vil@@ lingen , where there was also a Mu@@ en@@ ster Un@@ ser@@ er &apos;s wife , and so the Pil@@ gri@@ m was ki@@ cked off from Münster . &quot;
&quot; each day and evening individual day tours were framed by a brief impulse with different prayers , songs and written texts . &quot;
&quot; but also on the way , the Min@@ is on field crosses , chap@@ els or churches repeatedly made R@@ ast to sing together a song of specially assembled pilgri@@ m song . &quot;
&quot; for the overnight stays , the local parish priests of the local parish were available . &quot;
&quot; at the stage destinations , Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller were looking for a tasty and strengthening dinner and breakfast . &quot;
we continued on the second day on Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
&quot; the day after , the stage came to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting stretch of road , but had to be lowered at first about 500 meters in the heat of the heat and then climbed again . &quot;
&quot; in the evening , the deserved reward was a shared barbecue at the bathing pond . &quot;
&quot; after the morning pulse on the fourth Pil@@ gri@@ m &apos;s day in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter , it went to Freiburg on the final stage . &quot;
&quot; visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy , the Min@@ is met on Freiburg Min@@ ster in the late afternoon and walked through the gates of mercy . &quot;
with a small impulse God thank@@ ed God .
&quot; at the evening mass in Münster , the Min@@ is by Ko@@ operator Markus Ober@@ t , commented on the Pil@@ gri@@ m &apos;s goal . &quot;
&quot; after the divine service , pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar . &quot;
the next day was still time for the B@@ reis@@ gau metrop@@ ole .
in the afternoon we went back to Hor@@ b by train .
&quot; at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked . &quot;
Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ med home when Brit@@ on won gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner last night in the men &apos;s team spr@@ int in the Vel@@ o@@ rom in Rio for glory when the British Team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glas@@ gow took the anchor in which his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made himself E@@ igen . the legend hau@@ led the legend when he stor@@ med home to get a victory from the favour@@ ites of New Zealand .
&quot; four years ago England claimed a sho@@ cking victory , while Ho@@ y picked the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als . &quot;
&quot; they repeated the trick , after they held a modest sixth place in March at the World Championships in London in spite of Ho@@ ys &apos; res@@ ignation . &quot;
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie staff .
they did this in time as a hin@@ dran@@ ce .
Ho@@ ys retired creates a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Scot@@ sman that has now un@@ folded .
&quot; Hin@@ du , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y wins - and Sk@@ inner placed an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds , but in the standard rounds , the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; after his lap he was almost back , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it . &quot;
a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation that went down in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenn@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
&quot; Ho@@ y looked at his position as a BBC expert and fell on Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des , when they climbed onto the podium . &quot;
&quot; Glas@@ gow &apos;s 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner said : &quot; &quot; it is a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name .
&quot; in the final round , we set up an Olympic board and defeated the world champi@@ ons . &quot;
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; after the triumph in 2012 at the Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys side , Hin@@ du admitted that after a weak start he deliberately fell on the track . &quot;
he with@@ drew this statement later and there was no acqu@@ itt@@ al of England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
&quot; with such a great victory , this time there was no such problem . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; It feels like all the UK flags on the tri@@ bun@@ e like London . &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
we got so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics .
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , winning seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London . &quot;
if that is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months is that we expect successful five days in the cycle current .
&quot; with the shape of Kenn@@ ys , it is possible that he repeated Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic Gold Med@@ als in a competition . &quot;
&quot; that would be for Kenn@@ y - who was 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who also was born on March 23 ( a apparently holy date for British sports ; on the day also Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal . &quot;
that would be the same from Ho@@ y .
&quot; Kenn@@ y takes part in the spr@@ int next , which starts today and will go for more than three days . &quot;
&quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a little lonely to win alone .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; If he wins two gold med@@ als , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot;
&quot; it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England . &quot;
&quot; Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ bles qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ kilometer race . &quot;
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 42 .
&quot; the world record , which won Gold in 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 . &quot;
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held today on the second day of the competition where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety .
&quot; yesterday , he had argued with officials before the qualification , when they called him function@@ aries to measure his height . &quot;
&quot; in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , which will be continued and finished tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ el S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ ga@@ vie will be in the world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot;
the UK team is relying on his strong team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and take a crowd of med@@ als .
&quot; after a truly extraordinary portra@@ yal of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down . &quot;
&quot; Dra@@ mas played in the background , the res@@ ignation of Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton &apos;s technical manager in April in the middle of sex@@ ism and bul@@ b@@ ings as well as the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; however , if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom it looks like the now legendary reputation of G@@ Bs , which reached its climax at the perfect moment , will be repeated . &quot;
future of Port@@ land sm@@ el@@ ting due to the elimination of energy demand
&quot; the future of the aluminium melt from Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ stations of workers - are on the stake , as the system operator announced the energy supply contract and thereby abol@@ ishes all delivery contracts , as the energy company supplying . &quot;
&quot; this step followed the government &apos;s decision at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies for the operation of the plant . &quot;
a subsi@@ dy for 20 years runs out in November .
&quot; up to 2,000 jobs in the Al@@ coa plant in Port@@ land are at stake . &quot;
not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure .
&quot; in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects as the melt @-@ melt consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victoria . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Al@@ coa completed the point Henry Schmel@@ zer , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power station last year . &quot;
Al@@ coa &apos;s melt in Port@@ land loses money and risks a closure .
&quot; this step follows the years of speculation concerning the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , supplying the large aluminium melt with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three other owners will announce their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the facility is owned by a joint venture between Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p keep smaller shares . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity by the melt , &quot; said the company . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts were called &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging business &quot; , &quot; which should have entered into force from November 2016 . &quot;
the contracts have a 12 month notice period so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; therefore , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to the revenues , &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot;
all potential effects on the revenues to AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
&quot; AG@@ L announced that the value of the contracts had already depreci@@ ated in its annual subscription amount of $ 18@@ 7 million , in &quot; anticip@@ ation of termination . &quot; &quot;
Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts is the &quot; ability Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the melt or to ensure the electricity supply to the melt . &quot;
&quot; the US company said that in 2010 it concluded a 20 year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang , which should have entered into force from November this year , even if there is yet another explanation why it has res@@ igned from the contract . &quot;
analysts warn of the poor economic conditions in the industry prior to the possible closure of the Port@@ land melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
&quot; in reference to the analysts &apos; statements at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land uses around 600 meg@@ a@@ watts and Tom@@ ago around 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity every year . &quot;
&quot; if both systems should disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as a generating set , that wouldn &apos;t be good , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; more than just a kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an reality TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hy@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner C@@ lans Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vo@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador for Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and ran to Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on her Inst@@ agra@@ m account . &quot;
&quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover made me cry , &quot; &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all . &quot;
&quot; the cover of the cover was a bizarre ( or simply keeping up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans ) , a critical reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner family ( with the exception of the problem cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n ) , as they forgot the cover of their sister and ending with a classic turn : they all have planned a surprise party . &quot;
&quot; this represents the c@@ lich@@ é @-@ ha@@ iled plot almost every birthday episode of a children &apos;s programme ( Se@@ ac@@ enter brought the sentence , &quot; &quot; You thought we &apos;ve forgotten you ? &quot; , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to leave her other girls somehow in this publicity . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue , a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans has begun with certainty . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all &apos;s great sister Kim likes her , concerning the Vo@@ gue cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself . &quot;
the September issue is the most sold issue of the year for Vo@@ gue .
&quot; with a volume similar to an image book as a fashion magazine , the issue draws a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were from the 8@@ 32 pages of the tome 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) . &quot;
the un@@ v@@ eiling of his cover stars is expected to be so eag@@ erly awaited that in the last two years images of the magazine had been scrut@@ ini@@ zed before the official announcement .
&quot; women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in recent years there have been clearly more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties who are mod@@ eled &quot; as &quot; models , celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; on the cover . &quot;
&quot; Oscar Prize lau@@ re@@ ate and Di@@ or brand ambassador , J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence , was on the cover in 2013 , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour . &quot;
&quot; but even with the small chance that Mrs. Jen@@ ner , who is described as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - falls under the earlier category , she is in good company . &quot;
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers from today who know how to turn a good snapshot video ( even if everything is applicable to Jen@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
&quot; Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade . &quot;
of course J@@ enn@@ ers does not like success to everyone .
&quot; with their reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the fashion world has always been somewhat stra@@ ined . &quot;
&quot; in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed her and called her &quot; the mist@@ let@@ oes of the moment . &quot; &quot;
these feelings cooked up again when the news came out with the appearing J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue cover .
but lashing around on the mis@@ fortune seems to pass by at the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all her sisters sell you pictures of yourself on their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
she sold her made pictures of Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds &apos;s daughter to the magazine W@@ TV .
and in her free time she is to be seen in Reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
&quot; community centres show annually 160@@ ,000 people &quot;
&quot; more than 160@@ ,000 of the country &apos;s relief efforts are out@@ law@@ ed annually by the community centres , while the industry is preparing for the impact of further mid @-@ cuts to already over@@ loaded transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy people , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ o@@ gi@@ ances and the like - are rejected for free legal advice and legal assistance . &quot;
&quot; the municipality &apos;s legal services , which are already over@@ crowded , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; as of June next year , these legal centres will lose further 30 percent of its federal assets . &quot;
the director of the Que@@ ens@@ land James Far@@ r@@ ell community centres said that the last survey of the National Association of Community Centr@@ es revealed that thousands of people are rejected each year .
Far@@ r@@ ell said the situation would only be worse without the decision of the Federal Government .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s municipal centres are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , meaning that thousands of people are rejected by important services you need , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relationships , people with uns@@ ur@@ pass@@ able and oppres@@ sive debt , families released by separ@@ ations , workers who were un@@ ju@@ stly dismissed - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot receive the assistance they need . &quot;
&quot; the federal government will cut the funds by 30 percent as of June 2017 , meaning that thousands of hil@@ arious people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we call on the At@@ tor@@ ney General and Justice Minister and Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to delay these short@@ cuts immediately so that people can get the assistance they need in case of legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance on the national average . &quot;
&quot; it is now time to look at the needs of the community centres and their communities , and that the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k inv@@ ests in this important work . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump election campaign accused after collabor@@ ating allegedly fire@@ arm
&quot; new York : Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s campaign has been accused of alleged un@@ activity after it has been told that in February , her campaign manager for North Carolina raised a fire@@ arm on an employee while they were on the road in February in a je@@ ep . &quot;
&quot; the incident was described in an indictment , which was filed in the Charlotte State Court on Wednesday by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state . &quot;
&quot; ordin@@ i admitted to have waited for months for the matter to be regulated internally , before he realized that &quot; this would not happen . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the campaign leader , Ear@@ l Philip , drew a gun , put his right finger on the trigger , and ra@@ mm@@ ed the course in Vinc@@ ente &apos;s Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; he gave in his indictment . &quot;
&quot; after compla@@ ining at the local and regional campaign leadership , B@@ ordin@@ i realized that at least four other people had made the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he admitted to the indictment . &quot;
&quot; weapons must not be fired to cause damage , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the prosecution comes only two days after the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate triggered a tur@@ mo@@ il when he said a crowd in North Carolina to take action if his rival should be elected H@@ illary Clinton and appoint judges .
&quot; it was clear that the media would have torn out its words from the context , and that it would not inc@@ ite violence . &quot;
&quot; ordin@@ is complaint demands damages from the campaign for breach of duty of care and of Philip , for bodily injury and permanent mental damage . &quot;
&quot; for a statement , Tr@@ ump &apos;s press spokesperson Hope Hi@@ cks was not to be reached . &quot;
attempts to contact Philip also failed .
&quot; W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer employee of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; not responding to calls with his consulting company , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services . &quot;
&quot; the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate , Donald Tr@@ ump , has so far led a controversial campaign . &quot;

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before countries elections : losing SPD and CD@@ U
&quot; in the upcoming elections in the states of Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , significant losses for the SPD and CD@@ U government parties are notable . &quot;
this resulted in representative surveys by the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
&quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition in the North could continue to go@@ vern , this is not possible according to survey values in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both states , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue to stand the head of government . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD fell from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent to 24 percent five years ago . &quot;
&quot; according to the survey , the party was just short of the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 per cent again . &quot;
the third place is cont@@ ested between the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; the left would come to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the parliament . &quot;
&quot; despite slight losses of 6 percent ( previously 8.@@ 7 per cent ) , the Gre@@ ens again hes@@ itated in the Schwer@@ in parliament . &quot;
N@@ PD and F@@ DP are not represented in the Land@@ tag with 3 per cent each .
&quot; according to the survey , the SPD election of the Berlin Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties only came to 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) . &quot;
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
&quot; they were still behind the Gre@@ ens by 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left , 15 percent ( before 11.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
the Af@@ D would be represented at the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties with 14 percent for the first time .
&quot; with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , while the pirates would miss the arrival in contrast to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
&quot; e @-@ Mail and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago , the Nokia Communic@@ ator came on the market . &quot;
the success@@ ors dominate the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the unit weighed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was thi@@ cker and bigger , so it was not good in the hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was quite cl@@ ums@@ y . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in memory at the beginning was eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would now suff@@ ice for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ ytes .
&quot; the Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator came to the shops exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , into the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few Euros fans can still buy the devices on the internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age . &quot;
&quot; 20 years ago , however , communic@@ ator was a sensation . &quot;
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover as an &quot; office in the west pocket format . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received for those standards at that time : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax , the communic@@ ator was to be reached . &quot;
&quot; even the access to websites was possible via HTML browser , though tor@@ menting slowly . &quot;
&quot; a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar . &quot;
there was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
&quot; the price was quite proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , ie about 1400 euros . &quot;
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
nobody was able to suspect in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
&quot; since then , everything has changed . &quot;
smart phones are a success story even if not for Nokia .
&quot; the Finn@@ s &quot; mobile phone division experienced an unprecedented disaster , and was finally sold and handled by Microsoft . &quot;
today the market leaders dominate the vendors who came all much later than Nokia .
&quot; always and everywhere online , that is today for a lot of people &apos;s everyday lives . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide . &quot;
&quot; sold around 1.4 billion units , Samsung and Apple alone account for 5@@ 55 million units . &quot;
worldwide sales with the equipment are around € 400 billion .
this includes the well @-@ running businesses of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies .
&quot; in the meantime , an entire industry has been created around the smartphone . &quot;
&quot; the decisive breakthrough to the mass market was just beginning in 2007 , when Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the launch of the i@@ Ph@@ ones at the Mac World . &quot;
&quot; he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an internet communic@@ ator , all by touch screen easy to use . &quot;
&quot; Apple &apos;s triumph@@ al march started , even today the iPhone is the Group &apos;s most important product . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had the after@@ thought . &quot;
&quot; after all , they disappeared , Black@@ Ber@@ ry has to fight . &quot;
the Sa@@ ws now have Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung .
&quot; 20 years after his invention , the smartphone is a matter of course . &quot;
&quot; on average , every German now looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; we all need to learn to take the smartphone even away , &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in charge of the Siemens executive board . &quot;
permanent availability is now regarded as a curse and blessing .
England must steer the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
&quot; He@@ ath@@ row will bring renewal and prosperity not only in local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; for me this was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just as it was in 2012 in London , when we took a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games . &quot;
the Olympics brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and this will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; we already have 10,000 new apprentices@@ hips for our local communities , creating 40,000 new jobs and an end to youth unemployment in the airport . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who think that the challenge of the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row is too big . &quot;
I have been told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ aming ourselves on the world stage .
&quot; the doub@@ ters had wron@@ ged in 2012 , and they will lie wrong also at He@@ ath@@ row . &quot;
&quot; there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answers every question asked . &quot;
&quot; like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not single infrastructure projects . &quot;
&quot; expansion is a way to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 2@@ 11 billion in am@@ using growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment in both the airport and the UK . &quot;
&quot; we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , who has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from the T@@ 5 - the five year in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , until the T2 , which was built in the middle of the world &apos;s two @-@ bu@@ si@@ est cat@@ walks . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to deliver a third run@@ way , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment . &quot;
London &apos;s games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that He@@ ath@@ row &apos;s expansion will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .

&quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; &quot; K@@ atz and mouse game &quot; &quot; regarding ad blocking &quot;
&quot; according to one of the software manufacturers , companies who earn money with online advertising make attempts to b@@ ypass ad blocking , a &quot; cat and mouse game . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that there would block display cases on its desktop page , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program in order to once again block advertising on the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that his desktop page would change the encoding of its advertisements in order to make it difficult to recognise the recognition of which part of the advertising page is advertising . &quot;
but Ad@@ block announced that it found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
&quot; in a blog post , Ad@@ block Ben Williams &quot; spokesman wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her @-@ struggle has been underway between the announ@@ cing open source community and the b@@ ans since the invention of display block@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution . &quot;
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has embark@@ ed on the fight is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying indicator lamps have become for the industry .
&quot; according to a study from the last year of Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , around 200 million people worldwide use display blo@@ cker ; almost four times as much as 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 1.@@ 03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook about their mobile devices , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of advertis@@ ers &quot; ads . &quot;
&quot; the company has it based on ad block@@ ers on desktop PCs , as mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m , shared a spokesman . &quot;
advertising on desktop PCs accounts for a large share of revenues so Facebook appears to be worth the investment of such a step as worthwhile .
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update its &quot; &quot; ad preferences tool &quot; &quot; in order to have more control over them than advertising . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ Blocks would be wor@@ rying about new filters because they would also block content on the page that are not advertising . &quot;
&quot; this is not a positive experience for the users , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; said a spokesman for Facebook in an e @-@ mail message . &quot;
&quot; ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt tool , which is why we have focused on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences , in order to put more control into the hands of people . &quot;
woman in case of suspected suicide on Swiss motorway
the victim was lying in the middle of the night on the highway .
&quot; the police call on witnesses , after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday passed a suspected suicide of several vehicles on a motorway . &quot;
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
&quot; a woman laid herself in the dark &quot; &quot; in an act of despair &quot; &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a Swiss woman , at the age of 49 , who was taken over by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself . &quot;
she died on the spot .
&quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified , said the police , calling them and any witnesses of the incident to report . &quot;
&quot; an investigation procedure was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter shared the Le Tri@@ bun@@ e de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed . &quot;
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter . &quot;
two similar cases over the last five years show that drivers will not be held ac@@ coun@@ table .
&quot; in each of the two cases - in which a person was running in the dark on the highway , it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian is running in the middle of the night on the highway , as was called in the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; last year , a polic@@ ew@@ oman was acqu@@ itted of the neg@@ ligent killing after she had crossed and killed a man who was lying on the A1 in August 2014 near Pay@@ erne . &quot;
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and became unconscious in the street and took judgment .
&quot; the court found that the polic@@ ew@@ oman -- who responded to an emergency call -- was in a justified way , and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely extraordinary and unfor@@ es@@ eeable situation , &quot; the judge said . &quot;
&quot; anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges , should notify the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 . &quot;
NASA climate model : Venus was once hab@@ itable
&quot; according to the projections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was probably inhabited once . &quot;
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate researchers .
&quot; the model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere could once have er@@ d@@ war@@ like conditions . &quot;
scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation points out that Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ like atmosphere , and still slowly rot@@ ated . &quot;
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably referred to more dry areas as de Earth , but once had enough water and geographic vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protected from rapid evap@@ oration . &quot;
early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow rotation of the Venus exposed their daily side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; said G@@ ISS scientist Anthony D@@ el Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat . &quot;
the result is average temperatures which are some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus that resembles evolution previously suspected by planet researchers .
&quot; although it was probably hab@@ itable , Venus -- over the course of several billion years - exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light . &quot;
their oceans evapor@@ ated and their water vap@@ our was burned away from ultra@@ violet light .
&quot; as their hydro@@ gen , there remained only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a le@@ thal greenhouse effect -- the Venus , as we know it today . &quot;
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy joins A@@ val@@ an@@ che as Trainer of the A@@ val@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a trainer and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che and led to low co @-@ determination in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
&quot; alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately seek a new trainer . &quot;
&quot; over the last three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination . &quot; &quot;
&quot; during the summer , I have been thinking long and much about how I could improve this team , to give it more depth , and to bring it to a higher level . &quot;
&quot; to achieve this , the Vision of the Train@@ ers and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to those of the organization . &quot;
he also has to have a right to co @-@ determination in decisions that influence the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not met .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , who was hired by Roy on May 23 , 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team . &quot;
&quot; Patrick told me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot;
we appreciate all that he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future .
&quot; during his debut season , Roy has won the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as winner of the Jack Adams Awards as the best trainer of the league . &quot;
&quot; he introduced the club to 112 points and first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed the post @-@ season in each of the last two years . &quot;
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell by five points behind the game for a second wild card spot in the Western Conference .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with Montreal Canadi@@ ens and A@@ val@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ th@@ ee@@ pers resume talks and strike strike
&quot; the fight for wages for North @-@ sea workers will be suspended , while all the dispute parties sit at the table for a new round of talks , negoti@@ ators said . &quot;
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were spor@@ adi@@ cally carried out on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the resolution process of the present strike , &quot; &quot; it says in a common statement . &quot;
we will stop a few full @-@ day sessions in the next few weeks that will start at the beginning of next year to address the problems .
&quot; the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; this year , Wood Group has reduced rates to its contractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure . &quot;
the company &apos;s credit rating follows a 10 % decline in on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts to the company give the company the required space to come through the market down@@ turn .
shell has released for its part thousands of people and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas activities in up to 10 countries as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its mega @-@ merger with the British energy company BG Group .
&quot; due to the lower crude oil prices , energy companies are under pressure , an economic situation , which was strengthened by the British decision in June to leave the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the Scottish Parliament member , Dave Anderson , met with workers leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the greatest work disputes that took place in the North Sea for a generation . &quot;
&quot; the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said . &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea and across the country , we need an economy that works for many and not just for a few , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion are expected for new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of stars in the Stern@@ enh@@ aufen of the P@@ lei@@ ades
&quot; the latest mission , with the Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope , has helped astronom@@ ers to gather the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades . &quot;
&quot; the new data help astronom@@ ers understand why stars in the star cluster rotate to different rates , as well as in which connection the rot@@ ational periods are associated with the planet formation . &quot;
&quot; we hope that through comparing our results with other star enh@@ ouses , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the star @-@ run of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light @-@ years from the Earth .
&quot; many stars in this Stern@@ enh@@ aufen , which originated some 125 million years ago , are now reaching adul@@ th@@ ood . &quot;
they are now turning the fastest .
&quot; at peak rotation rates , these po@@ int@@ less stars rep@@ el large amounts of star winds . &quot;
&quot; as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star is age , its rotation rate begins to slow down . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sun@@ spots -- .
the newest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more massive stars rotate more slowly than a few massive stars .
&quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with larger stars on slower pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; Reb@@ ull said . &quot;
&quot; since the Stern@@ enh@@ aufen of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates . &quot;
&quot; the star @-@ run of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; we would like to learn more about how , when and why stars slow down their rot@@ ational rates and hang up their &quot; &quot; dancing shoes &quot; &quot; so to speak . &quot;
&quot; in three newspaper reports , Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported in detail about their latest analysis of the rot@@ ational rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal . &quot;

&quot; I &apos;m saying &quot; Goo@@ db@@ ye &quot; to join , &quot; explained the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star @-@ Game @-@ Parti@@ cip@@ ant of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was elected the most valuable player in the League , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot;
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract has been filing for $ 27 million annually since 2007 .
&quot; until the end of the contract on December 31 , 2017 , he will act as a consultant and youth coach - with full salary . &quot;
&quot; as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid for a long time with performance . &quot;
&quot; with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; &quot; R@@ uns &quot; &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es he managed to make some mil@@ estones . &quot;
&quot; with Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two more bas@@ eball players have similar values in the most important statistics . &quot;
&quot; however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old is not likely to be included in the rest hall of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls . &quot;
&quot; because so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; - was in the field , so controversial its appearance outside of the square . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , the super@@ star was joined by &quot; ES@@ PN , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 , to have accepted forbidden ster@@ oids . &quot;
&quot; in August 2013 , he was closed for 2@@ 11 games due to an involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis scandal by the end of 2014 . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered to be the main suspect for years through an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
&quot; after a legal dispute , the ban was reduced to 162 encounters . &quot;
&quot; the league might have done me a favor for 2014 , because I played for 20 years without a break , &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said at that time sweet . &quot;
even his farewell @-@ days do not run quietly .
&quot; while many bas@@ eball legends have once again received the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench . &quot;
&quot; my job does not include farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job involves trying to win any game , &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di . &quot;
&quot; at least , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and said to the circumstances with Pop@@ star Madonna and the act@@ ress Kate Hudson , was followed by the fans of Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ Erz@@ s@@ riv@@ ale Boston Red So@@ x . &quot;
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; sang the followers at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team . &quot;
&quot; Olympia 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases &quot;
&quot; caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing test , Wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland could not start in Rio . &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing events .
a wi@@ ped athlete had won almost a medal .
&quot; before the seventh day of competition , the first official dop@@ ing cases have become known in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter @-@ obstacle @-@ runner in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested and excluded - immediately before the start of the critically acclaimed Ath@@ le@@ tics competitions this news came to an end . &quot;
&quot; in Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de has been proven last Sunday , which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances . &quot;
the International Sports Court ( CA@@ S ) confirmed their exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon .
&quot; on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old had finished fourth in the final over 100 m Butter@@ fly , just 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en would have participated in the events over 50 m of Fre@@ estyle . &quot;
&quot; at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) , the opening of the B @-@ sample and a hearing has been applied . &quot;
&quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; &quot; very seriously and requires full co @-@ operation with the investigations &quot; , &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Criminal Court CA@@ S and will accept the judgement . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history , the IO@@ C is no longer responsible for the san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; also in the night of Rio , the news flew over the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on to the offensive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; said the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; she was innocent , &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be nutritional supplements , &quot; &quot; said the athle@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , it is said that the banned substance is the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ ova has been suspended for the time being , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample should also have a positive effect . &quot;
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ y@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v immediately spoke to criticism of the bul@@ letin .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes don &apos;t draw the right conclusions , &quot; he said : &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot;
&quot; thus , approximately all weight lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing @-@ laden nation are not allowed to participate in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the case &quot; &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; &quot; was also known , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested like his brother Tom@@ as@@ z three days earlier on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon . &quot;
&quot; both cover the intake , but both must not start in the class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; before the launch of the athletes , Dan@@ ek@@ ova &apos;s case is another serious blow for the reputation of the whole sport . &quot;
&quot; the IA@@ AF world association had prohibited the entire Russian squ@@ ad to any exception due to systematic dop@@ ing , even the Ken@@ yan nation produces numerous bad news in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the swimming @-@ sport , the earlier off@@ ences in China had also ensured fierce battles between athletes . &quot;
the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t har@@ sh@@ red the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Y@@ ang .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ el li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium above 200 m Fre@@ estyle , I want to hand over , &quot; Lac@@ our@@ t said in the French radio . &quot;
sun also focused on a confrontation with the Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing fraud , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; sun was positively tested in the Chinese championships in 2014 on the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but only had to sit down for a three month lock . &quot;
theft : so per@@ fi@@ de presses hack@@ ers their ran@@ som
program@@ mers of black@@ mail malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful .
&quot; according to a recent survey by malware defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes of 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the sur@@ vey@@ ed companies in the past twelve months were at least once , sometimes several victims of an attack with black@@ mail software . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , just under 20 percent of companies were already aiming for ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail . &quot;
40 per cent of the victims willingly paid the ran@@ som demanded by the perpetr@@ ators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data again .
the perpetr@@ ators speci@@ alize their black@@ mail software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes based on attacks in corporate networks .
&quot; if they are successful there , the potential to express ran@@ som is much higher than with private users . &quot;
&quot; we are currently watching a start@@ ling fast evolution of the malware , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most of the Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were designed to send advertising . &quot;
then the perpetr@@ ators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
&quot; only private users were the target , but the change to company attacks was sc@@ ary fast in recent months . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware works after a simple pattern : once active on a victim &apos;s computer , it seeks to search for recently changed files such as Word@@ - , Excel or database files as well as archives of pictures and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and cle@@ ars the origin@@ als in a sustainable way .
&quot; subsequently , the software presents the demands of the black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; to get the final key code to the files , the victims have to transfer money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currencies Bit@@ coin . &quot;
&quot; but where private users are using the personal photo database on the game , companies are about sensitive customer data or project databases , without which production is shut down . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the damage occurs when a ran@@ som@@ ware sl@@ ammed . &quot;
&quot; 22 percent of German companies affected reported net sales losses due to ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent had to break the business operation completely , in one case people were in danger of life . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , several hospitals already suffered from attacks whose patients can be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records . &quot;
&quot; we always say to the victims : don &apos;t pay , you only support the problem , &quot; says K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies pay their data again .
&quot; in view of a stand@@ still in operation , it is difficult for managers to reject the demand of the perpetr@@ ators . &quot;
hack@@ ers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
&quot; in a recent study , F @-@ Secure safety researchers investigated the use areas and contact with black@@ mail users and come to the result : the perpetr@@ ators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service in order to take more money . &quot;
&quot; they explain their victims by chat , how they can pay via Bit@@ coin , set free accessible support websites or de@@ code example files for free . &quot;
&quot; and if private persons are rede@@ emed for payments of a few hundred euros , companies have to negotiate tough and pay five @-@ digit sums to get their data un@@ encrypted . &quot;
&quot; in view of the potentially high and relatively low risk gains from Ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , hack@@ ers are becoming more professional and share the work , says safety expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the antivirus provider Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware within a week . &quot;
&quot; however , it is more likely that it is about three or four persons . &quot;
the program@@ mers then sell their malware in the form of a software modular system to the actual black@@ mail .
&quot; the malware kits were created by buying malware for themselves , advice and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; the scope of supply includes an adjustment tool , so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski says . &quot;
the black@@ ers then seek further hack@@ ers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service industry .
&quot; so , one logs in one of the forums in the underground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and instruc@@ ts another to install the software on as many PCs as possible . &quot;
payment is made per infected calcul@@ ator .
&quot; usually the criminals then instruc@@ t Sp@@ ammer with the dis@@ sem@@ ination , &quot; Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski explains . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the risk of ran@@ som@@ ware is known by many companies that better safeguard their data . &quot;
more than 50 percent of companies in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey trust Ran@@ som@@ ware to be able to rep@@ el Ran@@ som@@ ware by file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanner software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful en@@ closures , the perpetr@@ ators are threatened instead with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing cultures , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; this means that the damage potential is much higher than before , depending on the type of data . &quot;
&quot; in the future , too , the perpetr@@ ators could take completely new goals on the internet of things . &quot;
&quot; at the Def@@ con Hack@@ er@@ konferenz , security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the winter , the activation of such a blocked heating may well be worth a ran@@ som . &quot;
&quot; if the perpetr@@ ators then block a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
&quot; in the small HR @-@ V , Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é , and even the versatility of a mini van . &quot;
&quot; sound over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , really proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers in the first row and in the rear have a lot of space , it does not work in any place . &quot;
&quot; the interior materials are well finished and have a pleasant effect , only the upper side of the cockpit inv@@ ents something . &quot;
the HR @-@ V is much more versatile than comparable vehicles .
&quot; there is not only a trunk of 4@@ 53 l at high @-@ placed and 10@@ 26 l in folded back rests , but there is the &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like a cinema chair and offer storage space , which is up to 1.@@ 24 m high from the floor to the ceiling . &quot;
&quot; the luggage compartment can be loaded well , but the charging height is 650 mm higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm , the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp speeds up the HR @-@ V very power@@ fully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm . &quot;
&quot; however , his work should be somewhat qui@@ eter . &quot;
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is pleasing .
there is another mot@@ ori@@ zation : a 1.5 litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot;
&quot; the steering , however , should be a bit more direct . &quot;
&quot; in the tested top version , the equipment leaves nothing to be desired . &quot;
&quot; one of the safety systems is the City emergency braking system ( works by speed 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant . &quot;
the collision warning sometimes irrit@@ ates because it ass@@ esses many obstacles as &quot; approaching objects . &quot;
the remote beam assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent speed control responds to the traffic sign recognition and th@@ rot@@ tles the speed if necessary .
&quot; but the full connectivity is available only for the top features : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation device , App integration and more . &quot;
two USB and one HDMI sockets are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore a bit cum@@ ber@@ some to achieve .
&quot; the approximately 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine . &quot;
&quot; those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will get the gasoline engine from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emissions standard .
&quot; with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car . &quot;
airline is not liable : fall on passenger lift
an airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger lift bridge .
the Ober@@ landes@@ gericht Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that liability is only conceivable in the case of hazards that are typical of aviation .
&quot; during the fall , the pla@@ inti@@ ff had broken a knee injury . &quot;
&quot; however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it is a general risk of life , the court . &quot;
the airline had to pay no compensation for the man .
cases of disease : when paid the organizer
&quot; after their trip , sick vac@@ ation@@ ers will only get money back if the cause of the disease can be found without doubt in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; however , this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have shown the same symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the case , a family had suffered severe diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting on the second day of their ur@@ gency . &quot;
she spent almost the entire vacation in the room .
&quot; their illness brought the tourists back to a defective sewage treatment plant , which was supposed to contam@@ inate the sea@@ water . &quot;
the family considered that the trip was inadequate - and compla@@ ined of the organis@@ er .
&quot; in court , the pla@@ inti@@ ffs did not succeed . &quot;
&quot; indeed , the treatment plant was indeed defective . &quot;
&quot; however , the organis@@ er only learned about it shortly before departure of the pla@@ inti@@ ffs . &quot;
until then he had to assume that the sea water was fine .
&quot; so he did not viol@@ ate his duties , so judgment . &quot;
especially in the samples of water no im@@ puri@@ ties were found .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly due to infection - belongs to the general risk of living .
&quot; of 6@@ 91 guests , only 38 were ill . &quot;
&quot; according to the violence perpet@@ rated by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère said many people would have worried about further attacks . &quot;
the state must act sober@@ ly and decisi@@ vely at the same time to react to terrorist acts .
&quot; sure , our country will not answer the violence of the perpetr@@ ators with hatred and division . &quot;
we will not grant this triumph to the terrorists .
&quot; if offen@@ ders need to leave the country faster , the security and strength also increase the consent of the population for refugee policy . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère wants to achieve the implementation of the proposals until the parliamentary elections in 2017 .
&quot; he also announced further personnel strengthening of the security forces , &quot; &quot; in an average four @-@ digit order over a period of several years . &quot;
sympathy for terrorism must be under penalty again .
&quot; video surveillance should be improved , the ce@@ ase@@ fire is am@@ ended in such a way that the purchase of weapons on the internet is difficult . &quot;
the recently discussed sec@@ rec@@ y of sec@@ rec@@ y for physicians should remain in accordance with de Mai@@ zi@@ ères &apos;s words .
&quot; however , he wants to search for solutions in dialogue with the medical profession , how the endanger@@ ing of the citizens can be reduced , he said with regard to psych@@ ic ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; in order to counter@@ act the ra@@ dic@@ alization of refugees , the minister considers better social support necessary . &quot;
teachers need to be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mati@@ zed people .
&quot; to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the use of cover@@ t investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; SPD boss Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increase security . &quot;
it is important that the Minister of the Interior spoke clearly against Action@@ ism .
&quot; this was a sla@@ p for the sni@@ pers in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel told the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke media group ( Friday ) . &quot;
&quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union after a Bur@@ ka ban , and the abolition of double citizenship before . &quot;
it is un@@ constitutional to prohi@@ bit the general prohibition of full @-@ wearing .
&quot; you can &apos;t ban everything you reject , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; talk about rules , for example , in road traffic or for witnesses to court . &quot;
green boss Sim@@ one Peter accused the Minister of trying to simulate the act of action and act of action with a new anti @-@ terror package .
&quot; leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger , left @-@ wing party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger , said : &quot; &quot; fleet S@@ prü@@ che and a tigh@@ tening of the right to stay put people in this country no more safety . &quot;
better traffic flow at the motorway feeder
it st@@ umps regularly on the b@@ ypass road - here a picture of November .
but this should change : the legal remedy is to be extended .
this is good news for all car drivers who stand in traffic in traffic on the surrounding road every evening when they drive over the highway A@@ zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
&quot; on the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) , the road construction will be extended by 700 metres in the area between Hammer Street and Wes@@ el Straße . &quot;
drivers can then click on the right hand side of the hammer to the right .
&quot; the advantage : the traffic divi@@ des early on , whereby the overall flow rate is improved on the busy section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 . &quot;
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the District of the En@@ voy of Mu@@ en@@ ster @-@ West .
the train ride on the feeder anno@@ ys drivers especially between 17 and 7@@ pm .
&quot; on the week@@ days , the back@@ stage goes up to the bridge across the Alber@@ gh@@ er Weg and sometimes beyond . &quot;
the reason for this is the needle @-@ eye on the B 51 shortly before the exit Wes@@ el Straße .
&quot; from here , traffic is only ste@@ ered sing@@ ly via the motorway bridge . &quot;
the second lane had to be built in a three @-@ quarter years ago .
&quot; the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary load capacity , in order to record the heavy @-@ duty traffic in a double lane . &quot;
&quot; as long as this bott@@ len@@ eck and the associated week@@ day traffic will continue , the competent regional operation cannot say . &quot;
&quot; however , with years to be reck@@ oned with , the bridge has an official residual usage period of 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the legal remedy , the state company deliberately chose the slower time during the school holidays because with disabilities to be reck@@ oned with . &quot;
the traffic is carried out on Tuesday and Wednesday by a track on the construction site .
intercultural Travel : cultural Activities for Schools
the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the theatre play &quot; The invisible house . &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young theatre are planning a music project .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s enables young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule children &apos;s house has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning play &quot; &quot; The invisible house &quot; &quot; of the boy theatre Münster . &quot;
&quot; in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; initiated by the association N@@ ima &apos;s , 19 students visited the small house between eleven and 15 years . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee backgrounds , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster . &quot;
&quot; most young people of the class have come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 , including Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic images and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action , such as the press release of the Young Theater Münster . &quot;
&quot; the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tan@@ na@@ z West@@ er@@ berg from Spra@@ kel , and the young theatre will work together in the coming season as part of a music theatre project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December , teenagers with and without escape and migration background will be given the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music . &quot;
offers for children and families in theatre play and theatrical language mediation are in the planning phase .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural journey &quot; continues .
&quot; in view of the increased number of refugees , the association expects many classes to participate . &quot;
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for weather improvement
the weather has taken a stroke through the bill in the southwest of Germany in the southwest of Germany in the night of Germany - but there is still hope .
&quot; the night was bad for clouds and rain to watch the cel@@ esti@@ al spectacle , said the chairman of the Stern@@ warte Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning . &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather should be good , then we &apos;ll see lots of shooting stars in the sky . &quot;
&quot; the star @-@ shed is Per@@ sei@@ des , which with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour are among the fastest shooting stars . &quot;
they seem to have their name because they apparently come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us that goes up in the north @-@ east .
relaxing night : tips for sleeping disorders
&quot; in the evening , one is w@@ aking up for hours , at night , one is awake for hours , in the mor@@ nings there is no more sleep in the morning before the wake up rang . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; after all , one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about one quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not rest@@ ful . &quot;
how do sleeping problems or sleep disorders occur ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many causes for them , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eks , member of the board of the German Society for Sle@@ eping Beauty and S@@ leep Medicine . &quot;
&quot; what you understand for the time being , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , so there is a distur@@ b@@ ance and dor@@ man@@ t distur@@ b@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; as a result , many people feel uns@@ atis@@ factory or insufficient , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , member of the board of the German Home@@ Medical Association with practice in the Lower Saxony Var@@ el . &quot;
what &apos;s behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
&quot; organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors can be found behind them , but also medicines . &quot;
&quot; in@@ frequently , the sleeping disorder is an expression of another disease . &quot;
&quot; very early w@@ aking is often frequent in case of depression , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
and it can be that different factors damp@@ en each other .
&quot; for example , those who have a her@@ ni@@ ated disc can lie badly , wake up every two to three hours and possibly start to sal@@ ve about everyday problems and worries , there is an example . &quot;
&quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
when should I have sleeping problems to the doctor ?
&quot; if you do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and is com@@ promised on the day , you should go to the doctor , advises We@@ eks . &quot;
&quot; the impairment can look quite different : one is down@@ cast , tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulties with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical discomfort such as stomach or headache . &quot;
&quot; to allevi@@ ate sleep disorder , it is important to find out their causes . &quot;
&quot; treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or medications - classic sleep tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ quired . &quot;
&quot; Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , Head of the Inter@@ disciplinary Psych@@ ological Centre of Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin , has hardly been stressed in Germany . &quot;
&quot; in case of sleeping problems , one should first contact the family doctor , advises We@@ eks . &quot;
it can clarify whether the problems have a physical cause .
&quot; who should go to sleep , and what happens ? &quot;
&quot; for example , for snor@@ ing with breathing exercises , in case of disease fatigue , sleep trans@@ duc@@ ers or if one does not find the cause of a distur@@ b@@ ance disorder , Fi@@ etze explains . &quot;
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; just don &apos;t make a nap , &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
&quot; after turning , you go to bed at his normal time . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the electrodes on the body , one we@@ ars nose @-@ glasses , a chest strap and a fe@@ eler at the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera records the sleeping @-@ ends on the ceiling . &quot;
how can those affected get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of screws you can get for a better sleep .
&quot; she counts on : regular sleeping and standing times , not sleeping for too long , not sleeping on the day , not watching TV for falling asleep , avoiding alcohol and not looking at the watch at night - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that is quite and certainly not condu@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
what the jungle camp with missing med@@ als in swimming has to be
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler has expressed himself on Facebook for the dis@@ appo@@ inting cutting of the DS@@ V @-@ Team at Olymp@@ is .
&quot; in December 2014 , he took Gold for the first time at the short@@ wave world championships in Doh@@ a and at the same time represented his first world record . &quot;
&quot; now , the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ lete Markus Dei@@ bler via Facebook has protected his ex @-@ team @-@ mates in front of his ex @-@ team members . &quot;
&quot; in a country where an Olympic champion gets 20,000 € bonus and a jungle @-@ King 150@@ ,000 € nobody should be surprised about missing med@@ als , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page at night on Friday . &quot;
&quot; the transport system in swimming @-@ sport is bad , however , the dop@@ ing controls are very good . &quot;
&quot; with this , we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not see or even operate on the topic of dop@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t say that controls should be set here , &quot; &quot; he explained . &quot;
&quot; if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bel had to be registered nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot;
this is exactly how to keep it with countries .
&quot; whoever cannot be controlled for a certain time before WM / OS by independent controllers of WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not participate , &quot; says the election @-@ ham@@ burger , who meanwhile operates an ice cream par@@ lor . &quot;
airport : gang of porters arrested
professional thi@@ eves at Dus@@ sel@@ dorf Airport
&quot; on Thursday , the civilian flag of the Düsseldorf police managed to arrest two women and two men between 50 and 61 years . &quot;
&quot; as a band , the susp@@ ects had committed several hand@@ ker@@ chiefs and luggage ste@@ els . &quot;
&quot; at 9 : 30 p.m. civil servants in the area of Dus@@ sel@@ dorf recognized a gang , which was known to the polic@@ emen of past theft delicacies . &quot;
&quot; the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since the middle of July and have been involved in communal , labour @-@ friendly and particularly professional . &quot;
&quot; the specialists of the Criminal Com@@ miss@@ ari@@ ats 34 can demonstrate four acts to the thi@@ eves , who had been travelling to Germany for the purpose of carrying out criminal off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; they had captured a total of more than 15,000 Euros . &quot;
&quot; the Rig@@ a@@ er Strasse in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in does not seem like this at first sight , but the police are one of the &quot; &quot; dangerous places &quot; &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; if one goes along the road from east to west , one passes by play@@ grounds , a fres@@ ch@@ eted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ar . &quot;
someone has &quot; ugly ! &quot; spra@@ yed on the facade of a grey house .
&quot; compared to a Li@@ dl , which is to be demol@@ ished soon , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments is to be built here until 2017 . &quot;
&quot; however , articles about this &quot; trendy district , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in calls , will be bil@@ led with burning cars in recent weeks . &quot;
&quot; the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have rented lease agreements , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin interior designer Henkel has spoken several times for a hard action by the police against the project , the area called &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; on June 22 , the rooms on the ground floor , the ca@@ det s@@ mi@@ ths , were cleared with 300 police officers , pat@@ rolled sections of the street for three weeks , blocked parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94 . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the building workers were renov@@ ating the rooms on behalf of the unknown home@@ owners . &quot;
&quot; on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court decided that the evacu@@ ation was illegal and a day later , police and construction workers with@@ drew from sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon , the street works peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others talk pre @-@ L@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in the immediate vicinity of the house projects , there is a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens . &quot;
&quot; lef@@ tist violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has lived in the Kie@@ z since 1999 , and Jan@@ a * , who is here three children , are mainly anno@@ yed by the police presence . &quot;
&quot; with the residents of the house projects , they share the concern of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; it does not sound like a Kie@@ z , who wished for a majority of police protection against v@@ and@@ ali@@ zing left . &quot;
&quot; the tren@@ ch , which the Berlin interior sen@@ ator and the police make between house owners and their neighbours , apparently does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Friedrichsha@@ in in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional working @-@ class neighborhood , which today , compared to the rest of the city , has a low average income and a high risk of poverty . &quot;
&quot; in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost all the Mainz Road close to the Rig@@ a@@ er . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer had been evacu@@ ated under a large police charge in a down@@ right street battle , many of the projects in the Rig@@ a@@ er were leg@@ alized and partly inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the city district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and ball@@ ers from all over the world in recent years : with them , residents from East @-@ East and former home occup@@ iers share their neighbourhood . &quot;
this is also noticeable in the r@@ ents that have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are under attack as symbols for this development : they can be seen in win@@ ded pan@@ es or freshly painted fac@@ ades which were thrown with paint @-@ bags .
&quot; no other road was mentioned this year as often as &quot; &quot; left autonomous violence &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a reason for not all neighbours to view this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by the crime : crimes like body injury , according to statistics , are almost exclusively directed against polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; the majority of the off@@ ences make property damage , which tend to hit the newly built houses and newly renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a ten@@ ancy house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years , there can be no talk of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; in terms of violence , it is important : the people in the 94 are their neighbors , they are certainly not . &quot;
even the famous burning cars no longer exist in the Rig@@ a@@ er anymore .
&quot; for the architect , her street is not a criminal focus , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the street and gets more of each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliberately drawn into the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße - and remained .
&quot; that is why it was so important that residents get back their streets : from the police , politics and the media , which in July all suddenly claimed the direction of interpretation over the district . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away from them : uns@@ ec@@ ured new@@ buildings in former construction gaps that drive the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in the end , these are con@@ domini@@ ums that are not interesting for many here - people living here are more people who are not so well sto@@ cked , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; I cannot completely approve of violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should you do if you never listen to someone ?
&quot; there is fru@@ stration on all sides , including the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for bred horses that anno@@ y himself about color bombs : the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
&quot; those who come here should be aware of this - just like someone who moves to a pub area , can complain badly there about noise . &quot;

Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee officer
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in matters of integration and organis@@ er .
she is also a social worker on site .
&quot; since July , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es for Ur@@ bach . &quot;
the social pedago@@ gue supports the team of administration for Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; she sees herself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , working group refugee aid , administration , authorities and anyone else involved . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine customer of the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the egg @-@ cutting wool @-@ mil@@ ch@@ sau , which has above all a problem . &quot;
&quot; in this way , some - less ridi@@ cul@@ ing but rather on the multitude of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job . &quot;
&quot; searched for was an administrative force with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ term experience in the field of social work , just an egg @-@ cutting pleasure mil@@ ch@@ sau . &quot;
&quot; but administrative work is not its central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; above all , it is about organization , work with people on site and behind the scenes , as well as network activities . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent stake in three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time actors . &quot;
&quot; there are large and small problems , organizational , human and understanding problems . &quot;
&quot; soon , new containers are standing in the Was@@ en@@ straße &quot;
a serious problem has been for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been acknowledged .
the local authorities are responsible for the connection service .
they must accommodate the refugees in their own or hired living rooms .
&quot; the cost of the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the local authorities . &quot;
the responsibility changes from the administrative office to the Commune and the job center .
&quot; problem : there are free objects , but not every owner wants to offer his apartment . &quot;
the search has been very difficult for some time .
&quot; de facto , administration does not find private homes . &quot;
&quot; so far , it is not functional to rely on private apartments , such as Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , common apartments need to be ch@@ ased as it is so beautiful . &quot;
&quot; so , new containers will soon be placed in the Was@@ en@@ straße . &quot;
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; the point of view is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a permanent residence , there are intern@@ ships , apprentices@@ hips , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and employment opportunities for refugees and migrants who need to be gre@@ ased or set up . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building yard or help house masters , do non @-@ profit work - and that motivated and very neat , as reported by Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external action .
this is &quot; no occupational therapy . &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
&quot; the day needs a firm structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer . &quot;
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
&quot; so there are offers like sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses . &quot;
professional courses are rare .
&quot; so , here too , administration and honorary officials are jumping . &quot;
it is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; they must explain to the refugees that it takes time and can bridge the time wis@@ ely , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; who at some point develop the feeling that he can &apos;t help anyone in Ur@@ bach , don &apos;t work and be useless , he will never integrate himself . &quot;
the clear majority was motivated .
&quot; but there are also problem cases , says customer honestly , &quot; &quot; people with whom nothing works . &quot; &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
all this is already a &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task . &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : do the two have fear of ra@@ dic@@ alization , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine customer says quite clearly , &quot; &quot; what some nai@@ ve might call &quot; . &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these incidents are also subject to the refugees .
they would have the fear that the assass@@ ins would make them completely dis@@ credited .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so main and volunteers must look for activities on site and in the region .
they are always in the background that soon a new b@@ ump of refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need an upper limit ?
&quot; to answer this question clearly , the policy elu@@ des itself . &quot;
&quot; actually , it is unfair to put them on site . &quot;
&quot; in Ur@@ bach , we have not arrived where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; no new refugees , that would relax the situation . &quot;
Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bacher is already busy integrating the previous people .
&quot; these are about 100 people currently , mainly young men . &quot;
&quot; but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree . &quot;
&quot; the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers . &quot;
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : bur@@ gl@@ ars looking for helicop@@ ters
