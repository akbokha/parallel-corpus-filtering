<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">"at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Langer, with some colleagues, was looking for a bit of change with a ride on the beach."</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden Sportpyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">"after a few minutes the horses remembered their evening, they hunted back home in the fast gallop home to the feed troughs."</seg>
<seg id="7">"one kilometer at this pace, I was afraid."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," Langer says. "</seg>
<seg id="9">And then the equestrian career ended up again.</seg>
<seg id="10">Saturday was Germany's best golfer ever - 101 tournament victories - again close to horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">"he had his family run over the plant of the ALRV, on a horse he did not shoot himself for photo purposes."</seg>
<seg id="12">"long was the first time in Aachen, and thus also with the CHIO."</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German Sportsaid handed over to the man from Anhausen in the context of a small gala the Golden Sport pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is no lack of awards for the sympathetic athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silver Lorry leaf, Champions-Tour-Player of the year..."</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the Queen of Britain already adored him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 18th winner of the sports pyramid is long.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Aachen, he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday."</seg>
<seg id="20">"this award means to me a lot," says Langer, "because she is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment."</seg>
<seg id="21">"for decades, Langer has been fostering new offspring."</seg>
<seg id="22">"and so he continued the prize money of 25,000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="23">"with 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time US master winner was recorded on Saturday in the" Hall of Fame des deutschen Sports. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"the winners include the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Giengen, the fenders Peter-Michael Kolbe, the rider Peter-Michael Kolbe, the skipper Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumously the handball Erhard Wunderlich."</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of these sports cars came to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clintons and Trumps Economic Policy in Comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"not one thing is the two US presidential candidates, however, in tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the difference in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, rather philosophical difference."</seg>
<seg id="5">Of the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "Trump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warn that the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulation."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says."</seg>
<seg id="8">"he himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, says Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will massively return regulations, and he will be strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton, on the other hand, says: the state has to fulfil certain tasks; it has to open disadvantaged opportunities and needs money."</seg>
<seg id="11">"that is why taxes for the rich would increase, they say."</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in the need to invest, Trump and Clinton say almost word-like."</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate never announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in the infrastructure are classic democratic politics and are strictly rejected by the state-critical wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">"so on Trump, there could still be party-internal discussions."</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are more evident.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and drive coal mining again in the US.</seg>
<seg id="19">"oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas, which aims to terminate the Paris climate protection agreement."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Clinton, on the other hand, wants to extend the renewable energies with its investment program:" a country will become the superpower of clean energies and create millions of jobs. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"however, not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the transpazilian trade agreement, do not want to sign both."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, both of them do not want to isolate the US from international trade, but rather to better protect American jobs."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they should also be paid better, called Clinton."</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a famine.</seg>
<seg id="27">He wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must rise, then he says he must not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the large discussion of the coming months would probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand, Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens, is to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics believe that the budget deficit would only be greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand, Clinton, who wants at least from the rich, wants to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution either."</seg>

<seg id="1">Escape: "every escaped woman has experiences with sexual violence"</seg>
<seg id="2">Sexual violence is almost everyday life for women who are fleeing alone.</seg>
<seg id="3">"when they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized."</seg>
<seg id="4">A house provides shelter.</seg>
<seg id="5">Four women sit in a large kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="6">"each one has a baby, which is at most one year old."</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put her little son in her arms.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looks curiously in the room with big eyes.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother stares at the table-top.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until she notices that she is observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles and kisses the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene seems normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you talk with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"she is a division manager of Condrobs, a sponsor for social welfare services in Bavaria, and deals with the issue of women on the run."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are fowl.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the Munich North, they live in one of the few decentralised accommodations for single-minded women and their children in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="17">"in January, Condrobs opened the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Help."</seg>
<seg id="18">"recently, it was officially opened."</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are no men - not as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guard at the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who arrives here has had experiences on her escape with sexual violence," Bahr says. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they threaten torture or death, or because their families send them as hope carriers to Europe," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"in women, other reasons outweigh the flight:" many steal away secretly because they see no other way out. ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"in their homeland they have done experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, honors, slavery or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">This is what drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">"on the run, that goes on."</seg>
<seg id="28">"for example, that smugglers for a bottle of water demand a sexual act is not rarity," Bahr says. "</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone; they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">"who thinks that the end, as soon as they arrive in Germany, irre, tells Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="31">"here too, single-standing women in refugee camps are often regarded as inferior and at worst abused."</seg>
<seg id="32">"this means that about 90 percent of women living in the accommodation in the north of Munich are traumatized, they appreciate."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not born voluntarily."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are used to say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they don't dare to talk openly about the experience, because the shame is too big."</seg>
<seg id="36">"since they often don't know how to help, more accommodation needs only for them, calls Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees."</seg>
<seg id="38">"on the question of whether they knew about a similar project as in Munich in their sphere of responsibility, some answer with no."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, for example, there are not so many accommodations in the Governments."</seg>
<seg id="40">"in Schwaben alone, escaped women are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesman of the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Upper Bavaria, Lower and Middle Franconia, there are floors in some community shelters or their own houses only for single women and their children."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Lower Bavaria, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">The Committee "Rights of Women and Gender Equality" in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommodated separately from men.</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study published for the committee, it says:" it is very important that men and women are accommodated separately. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"if privacy is missing or if men and women are accommodated together, it may - perpetual - violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"above all, the washrooms should be separated and readily accessible to women, is in the study."</seg>
<seg id="47">"as the women feel this need for protection, one can read the rush that is available to the house in Munich."</seg>
<seg id="48">"since we have spoken about that there is, we have a long waiting list," Bahr says. "</seg>
<seg id="49">You could easily make a second house.</seg>

<seg id="1">Assistance doctors argue: demands for new work combat measures</seg>
<seg id="2">Assistant doctors have called upon their union to approve new work campaign measures in their dispute with regard to a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called for its entire Council to approve more work-fighting measures from the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC said that ministers had been accusing ministers to deal with the concerns about the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in July, assistance doctors and medical students voted on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA."</seg>
<seg id="6">He was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in a letter to the members published on Twitter on Thursday evening, the chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government was" persistently quiet "to problems, leading to the refusal of the treaty."</seg>
<seg id="8">"she said," "In view of this, the JDC Board has agreed to fully reject the proposed new contract and call for official new negotiations on all your concerns."</seg>
<seg id="9">"as an answer to the silence of the government, the JDC Board today announced a formal application for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve a running programme of escalating work combat measures that begin at the beginning of September."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the disputes led to the fact that assistance doctors fought six times this year, the first total outages in the history of the NHS."</seg>
<seg id="11">The head of the BMA assistance doctors Dr. Johann Malawana came back after the election for the rejection of the agreed contract terms recommended by the BMA.</seg>
<seg id="12">"he shared BMA members during the meetings, which took place before the vote by 54,000 assistant doctors and medical students, that the contract was beneficial and should be accepted."</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and to proclaim an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterparts in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I can't resist the impression that Ankara is most interested in this reconciliation."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was a handshake, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putin's smile seemed narrow, and he hardly radiated heat, even for his restrained relations."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke repeatedly of his" "dear friend" "Putin - according to a report full five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the next day, a newspaper describing that Erdogan had behaved like never would have happened."</seg>
<seg id="11">To me his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin's bright, sustainable cows showed that Russia's head of state had nothing to forget."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the downing of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was furious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin stated and accused Ankara to fall back to Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offense was even bigger as it was done by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Rebuilding the cousins will be difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months, the state-controlled media led a violent and unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks would blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">"most serious were the accusations from senior officials that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in the areas of Syria, controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He has denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology from President Erdogan, which he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia was able to book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are clearly obvious."</seg>
<seg id="27">"first of all, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after spending his last month in a failed coup d" état. "</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year."</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late season rush to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week, the state television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed to be allowed."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Vedemosti put it as follows:" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara furiously angered the West as it looked at its reaction to the attempt to take power as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"to this end, the persistent resentment on the snail-empo of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is eager to benefit from the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian head of state won a bonus for Ankara with certainty that after the attempted coup d'état he demanded support for the elected state organs.</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is a matter of course for Moscow, a matter of course, which even has a deep fear of regime change."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit in this splendid palace by the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to present an" "alliance of outsiders" "to me as an analyst once described an" "Alliance of outsiders" ": two countries that feel ill-treated by the West and are now fading."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave itself the role of peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be significant that after almost three hours of first talks, both presidents at the press conference said they hadn't even touched the issue."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the president of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize it."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a complete disaster, when NATO member Turkey fired the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders talk at least once again."</seg>

<seg id="8">"born in 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo."</seg>
<seg id="9">"on the Kremlin's website, it is called (in Russian) that he was later Chief of the Administration and Chief of Staff of the Government."</seg>
<seg id="10">"he said to Putin about his appointment:" "thank you for your trust."</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it's the main task of the government to support your work as head of state with regard to bills of law and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin informed the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov was asked to leave his post and recommend Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Are smiling faces convincing?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow enigmatic.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Sergei Ivanov, for a long time, was one of Vladimir Putin's closest confidants and works like him for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB."</seg>
<seg id="16">"as Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country."</seg>
<seg id="17">"at a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigns at his own request."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but despite the smile for the cameras, only a few are convinced, especially now, just before the parliamentary elections."</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the consequence of a sort of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this right now.</seg>
<seg id="21">"but the official claim - that a man who once toured as a potential president, wants to lead the Russian environmental policy once more - pushed to great scepticism."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in his remarks to Putin quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said," "It's true that I asked you at the beginning of 2012 in a conversation, to me this very complicated post - you could almost say - trusting posts for four years."</seg>
<seg id="23">"as it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months."</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Before that he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of the State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the late 1990s, when Putin was Chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy."</seg>
<seg id="28">"when Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people whom he trusted most."</seg>
<seg id="29">"once it was assumed that after Putin's second term, Ivanov could become President of Russia, as a third term of office had violated Putin's constitution."</seg>
<seg id="30">"but this post was taken by another, close ally to Putin, Dmitry Medvedev."</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he became president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="1">Crossing: bridge now connected with Fife</seg>
<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the northern deck of Queensferry crossings to the Viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is the first of four closures of the" "cover blower", "which approach each of the three towers of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 incline cables."</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Economy Keith Brown made a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he said," "This is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry crossings."</seg>
<seg id="10">"we are all witnesses of an engineering skill of a truly epic measure in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="11">"despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a tricky activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for the fit."</seg>
<seg id="12">"all in all, nearly 79% of the total bridge deck is at its place and the last section of the deck gets a gongg for the deck in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Michael Martin, Project Manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" the first closure is a significant milestone in every bridge project. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"in this fantastic project, the closure is a trend-setting high-rise and civil engineering."</seg>
<seg id="15">"after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the Nordturmdeck, which is located in the expansion, we had to close the still existing gap on the north or east side."</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">"massive, since the viaduct is 222 metres long, about 6,000 tons, and had to be pulled upwards at an incline of about 3%."</seg>
<seg id="19">"because the tolerances on which the team were working, they were tiny - on each side they rudled only a few millimeters."</seg>

<seg id="1">Who is building Braunschweig cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="2">The SPD and the Greens mean: investors should be taken into duty much more strongly in the future.</seg>
<seg id="3">How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">The SPD is proposing a "housing concept" at the next meeting.</seg>
<seg id="5">But dispute is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost it is about the question: who should build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"s & D Group president Christoph Bratmann believes:" "we agree with the Greens: those who want to build urban areas will have to exhibit 20 percent of all apartments as social housing in future."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the favorable apartments, however, can also arise in the continuance."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the main point in the town hall is, however, Bratmann:" how can you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces? "</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want investors to build on such areas at least 10 percent, but as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing as possible."</seg>
<seg id="12">"a new urban housing development programme, which will cost millions and still needs to be financed, should provide incentives."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the problem, so Bratmann:" there is no agreement between the factions at the moment. "</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make investors as little as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants to impose tougher constraints on investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">"regardless of this, viola, a tightening of the situation is on the housing market."</seg>
<seg id="17">"if the concept of action is implemented, it will take care of additional tasks in the building management."</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but the programme is not complete: the 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway."</seg>
<seg id="21">But how do you compare the loss of more around 1300 beneficial apartments whose funding will expire in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">"by 2020, there will be 500 apartments."</seg>
<seg id="23">"in order to prevent this, the planning policy spokesperson Nicole Palm should be bought from the city now."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in addition, it would have to be thought to bring back apartments back into the price bond."</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in Weststadt.</seg>
<seg id="26">"at one stroke, the problem could be solved."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the end of the year, Frists will be running in Weststadt."</seg>
<seg id="28">"about 1800 apartments, one could get back to the price binding for cheap apartments."</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: this does not mean the owners who do not have housing associations.</seg>
<seg id="30">"because the number of social housing in the western city is dramatically increased, the goal of the so-called mix-up will be removed."</seg>
<seg id="31">There should be no more concentration of socially disadvantaged in just a few districts.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens reckon that there will still be movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Mr Herlitschke said:" "the CDU must be in the boat for a broad majority."</seg>
<seg id="34">I concentrated on more construction sites for single-family homes.</seg>
<seg id="35">But what does not mean that a compromise can not yet be found.</seg>

<seg id="1">"Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that pays off"</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to watch how the world is changing.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the fact that teenagers and children don't go outside to play anymore, but rather prefer to spend their free time playing on screens has been complained by many in the last decade."</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">"the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then on video games and last on smartphones."</seg>
<seg id="6">So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">"of course I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters created for the video games in the 1990ies (later created a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs)."</seg>
<seg id="8">"like many pop culture phenomena, the interest in the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand declined somewhat at the beginning of July."</seg>
<seg id="9">Market launch in other countries has been postponed by the massive demand that overburdened the servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">"within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">"in short, the players go out with their smartphones outside and search for Pokémons, which are followed by a GPS and once they were found," photographed "(via a screenshot on the phone) or" captured. ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"a generation that played the game, when she was younger, joined the tram and jumped for the search of the sofa."</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the United States, the game resulted in a considerable increase in steps that the" average "person withdraws every day."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, which follows 35,000 users, announced the Washington Post recently that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of follow-up people, who exercise every day 30 minutes, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent."</seg>
<seg id="16">The company doesn't know who plays Pokémon Go - it merely looks the raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to get" "30 minutes of time", "" "come from the sofa" "and" "be active every day", "because many public messages for health are boring and coming from people who look miserable."</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overvalued."</seg>
<seg id="19">"those who regularly exercise sports, reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression."</seg>
<seg id="20">"physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here."</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderfull thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">"thus three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close new friendships.</seg>
<seg id="24">"as always, there are gruesome game spoons that always have to complain about something."</seg>
<seg id="25">"and yes, someone could run against a door."</seg>
<seg id="26">What is it supposed to do?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough occurred.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even if smartphone apps like Fitbit were already able to track down our activity earlier, they didn't give us the reason to play sports as it does this game."</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will be recreated with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, due to poker's success, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with the active in the real world and help many people in hunting to be more active, fitter and healthier."</seg>

<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast kicked off on Thursday for the multi-competition title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Their overall result of 62.198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and "Final Five" team mate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">"the Americans Simone Biles turnt on the floating beam during the individual multicampaign of women during the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Bilo is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a multi-competition title, and in total the fifth, while holding her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all."</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears when her end result was shown and her long journey at that moment found an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">"this achievement puts them in the same league as unique athletes, such as Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:"</seg>
<seg id="16">"it has won the last three years of its sport, 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic Champion of 1984 said she is" the best gymnast I've ever seen. "</seg>
<seg id="17">"she was expecting a final exam in Brazil, a competition not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations."</seg>
<seg id="18">"not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas would be regarded as disappointment."</seg>

<seg id="25">"since the summer of 2013, it has not lost any competition competition, a series of victories that will last as long as it wishes."</seg>
<seg id="26">"even if Mustafina was slightly led by two turns, the picture was deceptive."</seg>
<seg id="27">Floating beams and floor plans - in which Biles holds the title of the world - was lurking.</seg>
<seg id="28">"she recovered again with 15.433 on the floating beam - and, with a 15,933 on the floor, she added another."</seg>
<seg id="29">"Raisman embraced her gently as she expected her ensign - a pure form of formality - and tears poured out brilliantly red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her collection book."</seg>
<seg id="30">"the performance of Raismans was vengeance for the last time four years ago, when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a Tiebrake."</seg>
<seg id="31">"this time the 22-year-old team captain, which is called" "Grandma" "by the Americans, had a lead."</seg>
<seg id="32">"after their ground exercise, she cast down kisses to the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes appeared dubious."</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were killed, who died in one of the deadliest attacks for a decade in the first serial killer of Phoenix, while they chatted in the car and heard music."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis's daughter Maleah were shot on June 12 while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the perpetrator fired eight shots from a firearm while he was standing on the passenger side of the car, and then fled with another vehicle, is to be read in the report."</seg>

<seg id="9">"in the south of Alabama, a flood warning system was used on Friday, while it was still raining in the mobile area."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the river Comite near Baton Rouges and the river Amite near Denham Springs, which are both located in Louisiana, will probably reach record levels over the weekend."</seg>
<seg id="11">The metereologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many houses near Baton Rouge.</seg>
<seg id="12">"he also said that a downstream flooding in Ascension Parish is a danger, as these rivers flow slowly into the Lake Mauretas via the trodden rivers."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the river Tickfaw, south of the Mississippi border in Liverpool, Louisiana, already reached the highest level at 09.00 on Friday, which was ever recorded."</seg>
<seg id="14">Rescue teams still shrank people from flooding water in the districts of Amite and Wilkinson in the Southwest of Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Leroy Hansford, his wife and his stepson were among those who were rescued by Gloster on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house, grew strongly overnight."</seg>
<seg id="17">He said that another stepson who lives nearby would have warned him.</seg>
<seg id="18">"we woke up and the water flowed and flocked in," "said Hansford."</seg>
<seg id="19">It reached my waist.</seg>
<seg id="20">"his wife told Hansford that in the 48 years she lived there, she never saw such a high level of the river."</seg>
<seg id="21">Hansford said he and his family members would have all disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Hansford said that emergency helpers would have saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Gloster, where they stayed until Friday."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Krautmann said that the flooding had" "spread rapidly", "as there were still heavy rainfalls and that the authorities considered evacuation instructions."</seg>
<seg id="24">"according to Krautmann, an observer reported near Livingstone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.75 inches rain."</seg>
<seg id="25">Krautmann said that the soil was completely sucked by the rainfalls since Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="26">The authorities indicated that heavy rainfalls and flooding floods caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa parish and school failure in five school districts.</seg>
<seg id="27">The CBS affiliate WWL reported that an ordinate in Tangipahoa took over 200 flooded houses.</seg>
<seg id="28">"the inhabitants were evacuated in two churches, both flooded now."</seg>
<seg id="29">"the leader of the municipality of Robby Miller said that the authorities had rescued 72 people and seven domestic animals, which were rinsed by floods."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in the towns of Amite and Hammond, emergency shelters were set up to accommodate the evacuates."</seg>
<seg id="31">"as soon as the water starts to go back, they will be able to return to their homes," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="32">"in the town of Hammond of the commune of Tangipahoa, almost two dozen roads were closed down due to the high water and sandbags were provided for the residents, hoping to keep the water from their houses and shops."</seg>
<seg id="33">"the last big flood we had was in March," "said Lacy Landrush of the city administration."</seg>
<seg id="34">This seems to be a similar incident.</seg>
<seg id="35">"in Mississipp, the emergency manager Rupert Lacy of Harrison Countys said that it was raining on the Gulf Coast."</seg>
<seg id="36">"according to his statements, a handful of houses were reported to be inundated on Thursday, but on Friday no reports were reported."</seg>
<seg id="37">"Keith Townson, Manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years."</seg>
<seg id="38">"I have seen water in places where I never saw it before," said Townson, "and it still comes."</seg>

<seg id="1">"why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie"</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I present under the Women's Olympic Cup in the Turns and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">"first, I've been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant."</seg>
<seg id="4">"and secondly: this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren" Laurie "Hernandez, inspiring for many young girls of other skin color."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewish is and Madison Kocian, the Catholics, rounds off, makes everyone proud."</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in the last four years, the number one among female gymnasts was an Afro-American woman."</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">That shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">"at the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America cheered."</seg>
<seg id="12">"now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected, yet masterly gynastic routines."</seg>
<seg id="13">"on Thursday Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won gold in an individual multi-campaign event for women."</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">"we experience the top of this sport, but they don't look like sports classes throughout the country."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Simone, Gabby and Laurie all beat the same way as Aly and Madison to put it into the olympic team."</seg>
<seg id="17">"they are the" Last Five, "because the next Olympic team will only have four female gymnasts in the team."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but the reality is that Turns are a more expensive sport and Turner primarily in private sports clubs, which are maintained by parents who are responsible for training, training, travel, clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnasts and families)."</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these clubs are in wealthy suburbs which can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in these clubs, the Turner will receive their entire training and that is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, both trained their athletes, since they started with the gymnastics."</seg>
<seg id="22">"we have to give the churches aun countless, young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a more affordable and easily accessible gym workout."</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gymnastics foundation for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">"during my events, we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban young people (mainly black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners."</seg>
<seg id="25">"in September we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to offer the youth high-quality gymnastics, which deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport."</seg>
<seg id="26">"gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind."</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">"it is the inspiration of this team, who bring thousands of young girls to interest in the gymnastics and that's great."</seg>
<seg id="29">"it is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls."</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">"thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this genuine presentation of" Girl Power "by holding the Olympic Team golds and thank you so many young girls with different backgrounds motivated to get their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women."</seg>

<seg id="2">"the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistance doctors voted against him."</seg>

<seg id="4">"the first assistance doctors are to receive a new contract, which includes changes to night and weekend packages to improve the care of times and times."</seg>
<seg id="5">"Dr Ellen McCourt, the chairman of the BMA Committee for Assistance physicians announced last night in a message:" "assistance doctors have still raised serious concerns on the proposed contract, in particular that it will heat up the current occupation crisis and it will be used to treat all physicians appropriately."</seg>
<seg id="6">"with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress has to be made and the time runs out."</seg>
<seg id="7">Efforts on the part of the Federal Ministry for resolving disputes caused by talks have appealed to the government for reluctance to participate and sometimes deafening to deafening silence.</seg>
<seg id="8">"this happened to a promise made by Jeremy Hunt just last month, that his door would always be open."</seg>

<seg id="14">"Daniel Mortimer, General Director of the NHS Group, called on the assistance doctors to stop the strike."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Mortimer said:" "work combat measures do not achieve anything that is little, but already burden overloaded teams and service providers and prepare patients, carers and their families only worry, need and interruption."</seg>
<seg id="16">"over the last two months, we talked to the committee of assistance doctors and responded positively to the concerns regarding the guardianship and whistleblowings with the Ministry of Health and other ministries."</seg>
<seg id="17">"employers hoped that continued positive engagement on other important topics - such as posting, flexibility in training courses, training courses, mutual recognition of the curriculum, continuing education and the Ministry of Health regarding the compliance with the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May."</seg>

<seg id="1">The Culture of Political Correctness lets election fraud flourish in Muslim areas</seg>
<seg id="2">Former Mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutsk Rahman was removed from office last year due to corruption from office.</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of Political Correctness has led to the fact that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is knowingly ignored as a devastating government report today.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks the police, election observers and town halls to ignore evidence of misuse due to" hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion. ""</seg>
<seg id="5">"the former Minister of Integration and Municipal Government, who is now an antagonist, said that the intimidation of voters from religious reasons would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off shut-off tapes outside of polleners to protect intimidated voters."</seg>
<seg id="6">"he recommends that voters should lead an identification with themselves, in order to prove their identity in elections."</seg>
<seg id="7">"at present, a voter simply needs to call his name and address."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the report proposes to apply unremovable ink to a person's finger when they leave their vote, in order to prevent someone to choose twice."</seg>
<seg id="9">"whistleblowers should get more protection, says Sir Eric."</seg>
<seg id="10">It demands that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions from non-official committees or workgroups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this is not only for electoral fraud, but also to protect the municipal government from the broader corruption and finance culture that is associated with it," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was arranged by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlet election scandal in the east of London.</seg>
<seg id="13">"last year, a special electoral court ruled that the incumbent mayor Lutsk Rahman should be dismissed after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the Court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community" "in a cynical way" "and that he would silence his critics with racism and Islamophobia accusations."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Rahman should" "have led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious obligation of Muslims to choose it."</seg>
<seg id="16">Up to 300 voices were either doubtful or the result of imitation in which one person was chosen as someone else.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said that there were evidence throughout the country for fraud.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in particular, he voiced alarm to the fraudulent choice of letters - in which older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to elect a candidate of their choice."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean out the electoral system, including guiding evidence to prove the identity"</seg>
<seg id="20">"in his report it says:" "proving that pressure has been exerted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, in accordance with the will of the elderly, in particular communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi background."</seg>
<seg id="21">There were concerns that... State institutions had unknowingly ignored such behaviour as a result of "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Sir Eric addressed 50 recommendations to clean the system, including the prohibition that political activists work letterdial documents in order to stop" reaping. ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"the report, which is considered by Theresa May, also requires tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral directory to be used for immigration and social fraud purposes."</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID.</seg>
<seg id="25">Do not use removable ink on a person's finger as soon as she left her voice to prevent someone to choose twice.</seg>
<seg id="26">Conduct systematic reviews on the nationality of a person to ensure they are eligible.</seg>
<seg id="27">A three-year limitation on applications for an automatic letter code.</seg>

<seg id="30">A change of the law which facilitated an indictment for intimidation in accordance with the 1983 Representation of the People Act 1983.</seg>
<seg id="31">Photography ban on election stations.</seg>
<seg id="32">Requirement that only English may be used in the voting stations (except Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">"intensification of the training, in order to ensure that employees generally enforce that voters go to the polling cabin on their own."</seg>
<seg id="34">Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that after the Tower Hamlets case there was no criminal complaint.</seg>
<seg id="35">"the electoral court has declared Lutsk Rahman and his deputy for a ban on corrupt and illegal practices as unsuitable," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="36">"due to a number of reasons, he was found guilty for a number of reasons - according to the high requirements of criminal proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="37">He also criticises the ineffective "check-up" of the election registration departments of the town halls.</seg>
<seg id="38">"Sir Eric said," The Supreme Court in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal. "</seg>
<seg id="39">"our country carries a proud legacy as the mother of parliaments, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation."</seg>

<seg id="2">"the world outside is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com could make it a bit safer for you."</seg>
<seg id="3">"we talked to Rhone Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Confederation in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close distance."</seg>
<seg id="4">"regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from behind, this video will show you how to rotate the skewer for your robber."</seg>
<seg id="5">"when you approach you from behind, you should turn around as first, so that you can see your attacker and get out of the shooting line," says Mizrachi. "</seg>
<seg id="6">Then take the weapon between your forearm and shoulder before you face it with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">"then beat him with his knee to the bar and twist, while the attacker combats from pain, the weapon of his hands. hit him with the barrel and move backwards while holding the weapon on him."</seg>
<seg id="8">"with attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body from the shot, grab the gun and twist it so that the attacker can't shoot."</seg>
<seg id="9">"at the same time, shift the weight to the weapon and hit the attacker on the chest, then twist the weapon from its grip, before moving backwards and straighten the weapon on it."</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveler Ian Wright schabt for a guide his tongue at the dirtiest places in Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveller underlined his immune system and sausage-lex of a serious test by leaking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk shot his course on a euro note, a handrail at Piccadilly Circus, a rinsing knob of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"before leaking any object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he is going to get involved."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, which was filmed under the title" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "brought some surprising results to daylight."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought of leaking the rinsing knob of a pull toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact, in a kitchen sink, there are more bad bacteria."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"fortunately, nothing left he leaded, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his bowel by traveling through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public money to railway stations to rinsing knobs of toilets, the task put down his immune system under a test"</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the film he said:" as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the film, he got up to his reputation in any case."</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His test sample showed a luminometer number of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"compared to that, the luminometer number of freshly washed hands is less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to lick after their luminometer number was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands exhibit one of less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film he says:" "this comes close to the worst I have heard in a toilet."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more mutable than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not stop here because it is disgusting here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">"the company equips Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the extraction of intestinal bacteria and the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="23">"valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" we wanted to offer consumers something new. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We performed crazy brainstorming that ended up saying "Let's call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">Growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added:" let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had tasted some of the things I had told him, like the ecclesiastical Russian toilet, which is shown in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to lick it, and others where this was quite difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad that we recorded some of these dirty goodies on film.</seg>
<seg id="33">"in a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 percent of respondents reported lactic acid bacteria, especially with the well-being of stomach and intestines, and 58 percent said that they at least occasionally use products containing included lactic acid bacteria."</seg>

<seg id="2">"an asozial family left their social housing after a delogiation with a damage of £50,000 because they had terrorized their neighbors."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Treportcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall."</seg>
<seg id="4">"after being forcibly removed from their property, the employees of the housing cooperative found their property in an irreparable state."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the walls pointed holes, wooden planks were torn up, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated to the walls."</seg>
<seg id="6">The family was resettled and it is assumed that she now lives in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">"Donna McEvoy, who works for home administration at Cornwall Housing, said they feared that the apartment was no longer repaired."</seg>
<seg id="8">She said: "it was an absolute nightmare for people here and I think people don't have to live this way.</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider since this property is thought to be considered not as beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and their reputation is likewise.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inflicted was street fighting with baseball bat, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screams, strikers and floods."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Skeldon, 47, whose name stood on the lease, got an arrangement for anti-social behaviour in June."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in some rooms of the house, which may be torn down under certain circumstances, old trash was found"</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the estate where drugs were trafficked in the past, the wood legs were torn up"</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbors said they saw her fighting on the street and regularly called the police.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing delved her and her partner this week forcibly from the property after giving them an extended deadline of 11 weeks to volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="17">The delogiation was cheered by lightened neighbors who said their lives were made to hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">"one said," "They didn't care for anybody."</seg>
<seg id="19">We lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad.</seg>
<seg id="20">The countless times we say the police here are incredible.</seg>
<seg id="21">"this morning, we couldn't sleep."</seg>
<seg id="22">We stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to that!</seg>
<seg id="23">"now, where they are finally gone, it will be nice."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it would have arranged the family to cooperate with local authorities."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the family lived in the house, to which the police was called at regular intervals, for 20 years."</seg>
<seg id="26">"on the overgrown side of the community house, garbage and old toys were thrown down"</seg>
<seg id="27">"he added:" "it is a shame that the tenant has given an appointment to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and their family since a delogization is always the last step into consideration of Cornwall Housing."</seg>
<seg id="28">"this was a very difficult case, because the behaviour was extreme and their deeds had to be horrible for their neighbors."</seg>
<seg id="29">"I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall as well as members of the community who have boldly approached us and have provided us with the information."</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will give some comfort to some neighbours and the message conveys that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house, but that they were all over 20."</seg>
<seg id="32">A dirty mattress that is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after delogiation on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="33">Workers of the house administration will have to sweep away garbage mountains that surround the house</seg>
<seg id="34">"in 2014, the police carried out a raid in the house and found over 70g of cannabis as well as scales, paraphernals and cash in the amount of £1,700."</seg>
<seg id="35">Skeldon received a fine after she pleaded guilty to the possession of a drug of class B in commercial law.</seg>
<seg id="36">"she claimed that the money was for a tombstone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013."</seg>
<seg id="37">"after they were homeless, Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth."</seg>
<seg id="38">Many interior walls of the house were graffiti hammered.</seg>
<seg id="39">The police say they are lesbians that do not cling to the house rules</seg>
<seg id="40">"Angela Crow from the police of Devon and Cornwall announced that the delogiation was a clear warning to the other tenants, who do not adhere to the house rules."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this goes to those who think that they can behave without self reproaches, as well as those who have been harmed by such behaviour," "she said."</seg>
<seg id="42">The police of Devon and Cornwall will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.</seg>

<seg id="4">"after a fraud attempt at a doping control in the Olympic village, Kenya sent a trainer home."</seg>
<seg id="5">The International Olympic Committee decided to immediately set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case.</seg>
<seg id="6">"a Kenyan functionary told the former Sprinter and current coach, John Anzrah, in the Olympic village a urine sample under the name of the 800 meter runner Ferguson Rotich."</seg>
<seg id="7">This was reported to the team leadership of Kenya by the doping controllers.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the IAAF world association has requested the IOC for information about the case in order to establish its own investigations, an IAAF-speaker shared."</seg>
<seg id="9">"depending on the results of the investigation and subsequent measures taken by the IOC, the IAAF will make an assessment," he said in an IAAF statement. "</seg>
<seg id="10">"he (Anzrah) went to the doping control station and turned out to be Ferguson Rotich, the rehearsal and signed," explained Kenias boss de Mission Stephan Arap Soi. "</seg>
<seg id="11">He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete who stood on the list for training controls of the world anti-doping agency.</seg>

<seg id="2">"anyone who doesn't care and praises Erdogan is sitting on packed suitcases," says the Chairman of the Gülen-near Foundation Dialogue and World, Ercan Karakoyun. "</seg>
<seg id="3">"in short, the Kurd community of Germany expects tens of thousands of protection-seekers fleeing from Turkey to Germany."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in the medium term it might even be" "some hundred thousand", "the chairman Ali Toprak believes."</seg>
<seg id="5">"due to the toughness of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurdish congregation of Germany is expecting a mass flight to Germany."</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the short term, I reckon with tens of thousands, in the medium term with some hundreds of thousands of protection seekers from Turkey in Germany, if the Erdogan regime continues to fight minorities and the democratic opposition," "says the chairman Ali Toprak of the" "World" "of Friday."</seg>
<seg id="7">"because the government has already passed Kurdish strongholds with road facts several months ago, 500,000 Kurds in Turkey are fleeing."</seg>
<seg id="8">"after the desperate putsch, secular and oppositional ethnic Turks would be added."</seg>
<seg id="9">Many will want to start anew in Europe if they are further suppressed in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="10">"it cannot be that a state that receives refugees, produces refugees in their own country," Toprak said. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"the chief of the association mourned the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in alevitical cities."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in this way, Erdogan hopes to increase the outlying pressure on the remaining Kurds."</seg>
<seg id="13">"they are the last major minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have been eradicated or distributed over the past hundred years," Toprak said, who is also a CDU member. "</seg>
<seg id="14">The chief of the association demanded that the German government positioned itself "as sharp as Austria against Erdogan and its supporters."</seg>
<seg id="15">Also in Germany there is a "witch-hunt" against Erdogan critics.</seg>
<seg id="16">"for the first time in recent months, I am no longer feeling safe in Germany."</seg>
<seg id="17">The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad.</seg>
<seg id="18">"more Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and Oppositionists."</seg>
<seg id="19">The brand name as Gülen-trailer destroys teachers and other academics the professional existence.</seg>
<seg id="20">"he who does not adapt and praises Erdogan is sitting on packed suitcases, by the way also the Kemalist and Säkularen," said Ercan Karakoyun, Chairman of the Gülen-near Foundation Dialogue and Education, the World. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"as reported by the newspaper, on appeal to figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the Turks have already set up the largest group of asylum seekers who have been recognized for political persecution in Germany before the coup."</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals won't get anything from the summer campaign - and the vacationers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country's day.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">"2021 will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament already decided at the beginning of the year."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there is nothing more stupid than so far: summer holidays, heat and day-to-day election campaign - that bites."</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals who are supposed to be convinced by the electoral campaigners are on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="7">"most of the vacationers who are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so you are not allowed to choose the country's day."</seg>
<seg id="8">"practical problems include: helpers, posters hang up, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and enumerate voices at the end, only laborious."</seg>
<seg id="9">"until 4 September 2016, the election and last day of the holiday, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania must once again pass elections close to the people."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the hot phase, if you can say that at all, just started."</seg>
<seg id="11">"and it's about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition, must be afraid of his office."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys."</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting is how strongly newing AfD cuts off and what remains at the end of coalitions.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost inconspicuous election campaign, one can see from his big posters."</seg>
<seg id="15">"he travels through the country, disperses roses and chats a bit with the people, as he did his legendary wormful predecessor Harald Ringstorff also."</seg>
<seg id="16">"otherwise, Seelering has got cold feet and gives chancellor Merkel to blame for the blossom of the AfD."</seg>
<seg id="17">"your refugee policy, you" "We create this" "has speeded up the rise of the right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful office."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the CDU, with its leading candidate, the Minister of Interior Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is, if at the wrong time it is the right place for election campaign."</seg>
<seg id="19">She was invited twice Chancellor Angela Merkel to large-scale demonstrations; Merkel's federal election circuit is located in the north-east.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Western Pomerania."</seg>
<seg id="21">"there was probably the majority of other federal states," "said Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in NDR."</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's not a shame to anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once.</seg>
<seg id="23">"apart from that, the Nordost-CDU largely waives the usual election campaigns on marketplaces and in front of shopping centres with umbrellas and balloons."</seg>
<seg id="24">"this, according to Kokert, only plays a" subordinate role. ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Union also noted that, in the country, the base is crumbling, that it has to make a lot of effort to find a wire to the people again."</seg>
<seg id="26">"you see it as the left, the SPD, the Greens: there is hardly any available in the pages of the country."</seg>
<seg id="27">"the advice of the CDU electoral campaigner cocoises to his comrades, however, also self-exposing:" "they have to go where it hurts, namely, where people are: Dorffeste, Golden Weddings, birthday party must be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">"because much is at stake, Sellering has now called his SPD to a particularly committed campaign."</seg>
<seg id="29">"in polls, the Socialists and Democrats were last with 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and just just ahead of the AfD (19)."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in the election of 2011, the SPD had clearly won 35.6 percent before the CDU (22)."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the Greens, a small party with seven percent in the polls, are likely to make the leap into the country's day."</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue out of their vacations and relocate their campaign largely to the internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"online election campaign," says the president of the country, Claudia Müller. "</seg>
<seg id="34">"otherwise, green election campaigners embark on trace search for native voters among vacationers."</seg>
<seg id="35">"Silke Gajek, the top candidate, just curvt with a houseboat through the Mecklenburg lakes and also finds it nice."</seg>

<seg id="1">B27 rehabilitation: restaurants suffer from blocking</seg>
<seg id="2">There is nothing to complain about at the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="3">"for those responsible for the construction work, which start at 5.30 am and end only at 8pm, there are always praise."</seg>
<seg id="4">"they made everything quite jagged," "says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet fuel station."</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a superteam.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is no delay either.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the construction site could be relocated to the south at the beginning of the week, until the end of October everything will be ready."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it will also be praised for those responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to the establishment of makeshift cruises."</seg>
<seg id="9">"since the construction site was moved to the south on Monday and the closure of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen was lifted, and therefore the connection to Rottenburg again exists, the traffic situation within the place has relaxed."</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now drive from Ofterdingen to the B 27 on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">Passing traffic through the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there were partly significant complaints," says the Deputy Chief Executive Officer Florian King, responsible for the transport-related management of the rehabilitation. "</seg>
<seg id="13">"the residents of Bacherstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise, because many of the crews were looking for and rather familiar with their navi than the signage."</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that some trucks in residential areas were franking.</seg>
<seg id="15">"as the speed limits were not complied with, the municipality demanded more power from Mössingen."</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were considerable exceedances," "says King, who made himself informed on the spot himself."</seg>
<seg id="17">Two to three per minute have been scored.</seg>
<seg id="18">The quickest was on the road with 77 kilometres per hour in the Tempo-30 zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">"since the construction site has moved on, it has become quieter."</seg>
<seg id="20">For the business people at the B 27 it is only a small consolation that for customers from Rottenburg the road is open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the fact that the B 27 refurbishment has led them to drop in revenue lets everyone look through.</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, some are more and some less affected."</seg>
<seg id="24">"those who have less to do with the" end customer "are produced for other companies, for whom the refurbishment has hardly any consequences."</seg>
<seg id="25">"also at the dealership Maier Thomas Sulz speaks of a" "most slight drop", "but also admits that" "the running race is missing." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The most heavily exploited are the restaurants along the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">"J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, former crown, finds clear words."</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already existential.</seg>
<seg id="29">"not only did it, but all the restaurants have" hit hard. ""</seg>
<seg id="30">"the customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing."</seg>
<seg id="31">We must be glad about every euro turnover.</seg>
<seg id="32">"the sales revenue is more than 50 percent." ""</seg>
<seg id="33">"the renovation of the streets has been discarded" "by two years."</seg>
<seg id="34">Half of his employees have to be dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="35">"if I had a company with 4,000 employees and half would have been fired, politics would have reacted differently."</seg>
<seg id="36">"instead, government president Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request from Göhner if there could be a financial compensation, with the hint that the restaurant would benefit from the advantages of the situation at the B 27."</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties where something more generous has been handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">"with all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue."</seg>
<seg id="39">"after all, the family business has been here since 1715, pointing to the long history."</seg>
<seg id="40">"that other regular guests are now less frequently visited, because of the complicated transport management, he can understand."</seg>
<seg id="41">"if you can't drive, it's also elsewhere nice."</seg>
<seg id="42">"after the renovation work, Göhner has no doubts."</seg>
<seg id="43">"despite the crises with BSE and bird flu, Göhner considers the impact of the B 27 construction work on his clientele for the biggest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its long-standing history."</seg>
<seg id="44">"six months of construction work, which is already brutal."</seg>

<seg id="1">It is constantly being screwed in the name of the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="2">"after the latest attacks, Maizière's Interior Minister now presents a thick security package."</seg>
<seg id="3">But what has a state of tolerance to do with terror?</seg>
<seg id="4">And what does the coalition partner say to all this?</seg>
<seg id="5">Thomas de Maizière gives the serigner.</seg>
<seg id="6">"all his proposals are politically acceptable to the coalition partner," "says the Minister of the Interior in the presentation of his new security package."</seg>
<seg id="7">They do not challenge anybody.</seg>
<seg id="8">"other, more detailed points would initially be discussed within the parties."</seg>
<seg id="9">I also took part in it.</seg>
<seg id="10">"but as Minister of the Interior, however, he was placed on results and at a" "achievable consensus" "within the Coalition."</seg>
<seg id="11">"after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, de Maizière did a little time before he presented his conclusions for security in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="12">But they are all the more extensive.</seg>
<seg id="13">"a lot is already known, announced, announced, that a new security authority is to take care of the crack of encrypted communication is not new."</seg>
<seg id="14">It is also not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU regulations on passenger data and weapons law.</seg>
<seg id="15">The call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is not surprising as well.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in part, de Maizière starts a second approach for proposals not to be made with the SPD: he wants to raise sympathy for terrorist groups and knock jihadists with double citizenship to the German passport."</seg>
<seg id="17">"this will be difficult points for the SPD," states the CDU man. "</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, he still considers this to be reasonable and also demands nothing that has no chances at the coalition partner anyway."</seg>
<seg id="19">A few new ideas are presented de Maizière too.</seg>
<seg id="20">They partly have it in themselves: he is planning a quick procedure for deportations and more possibilities for incarceration of people before deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees who are targeted in the country should check their smartphones and disclose social media accounts for a security check.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the case of tolerations for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some even worse than previously - such as committing crimes or deliberately throwing their papers away in order to mask their identity."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of it is political and legally sanctioned.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some of them seem to have a bad effect and leave questions open.</seg>
<seg id="25">"and at some points - in the imtreatment of patients for example, the question arises: what does this have to do with security and terror?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the subjects of refugees and terror."</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be said that the attacks of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">"in addition, many people worried about security in the face of the high number of refugees."</seg>
<seg id="29">And things that people profoundly dealt with could not be classed in election times.</seg>
<seg id="30">Inner security has moved enormously into the focus.</seg>
<seg id="31">"first the stops in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice."</seg>
<seg id="32">Then the attacks in Wuerzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">The uncertainty is great.</seg>
<seg id="34">"and yes, there are election campaigns."</seg>
<seg id="35">"on the subject of internal security, the Union and the SPD are increasingly turning into position."</seg>
<seg id="36">"over the past few days, it was between the two parties."</seg>
<seg id="37">"only a garrisky argument about the equipment of the Federal Police, then about a security policy collection of some Union interior ministers, in which the resort chiefs also demand a Burka ban and a return from the double nationality."</seg>
<seg id="38">"also here, de Maizière is struggling to reconcile irreconcilable sounds."</seg>
<seg id="39">He doesn't think of a return from the double pass.</seg>
<seg id="40">We have fixed the discussion in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="41">To re-stop it is not useful.</seg>
<seg id="42">"and with a Burka ban, he has constitutional objections."</seg>
<seg id="43">"whether its own package is constitutionally unconstitutional and whether it is actually" reasonable "for the coalition partner, it has to be shown."</seg>
<seg id="44">There's a lot of things to worry about.</seg>
<seg id="45">"however, the SPD is currently trying to benefit from internal security issues."</seg>

<seg id="18">"in this period, Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles worldwide, 5.904 million worldwide."</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who actually buys records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely middle-aged men love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">"before you go to the comment section, to oversee it under the pseudonym Non-Alleculation Men's middle age with rough insults, this statement derives from current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the re-emergence of vinyl records is not attributable to a boom in millennials who want to welcome the novelty of physical objects, but to mid-life nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently purchased a record are all foresight at the age of 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hordes by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older turntables retain their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog was a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, a modest gray suit and wildly stuffed before I stop, hold my hands and say something intimate like:" so, let's take a closer look at it. "</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">"even though the heart of Soho is slowly forfeiting its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices fill the buildings where once independent vendors were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialty stores."</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, from Sister Ray (Number of people: two young women, three men of middle age) to Reckless Records (Number of files: eight men of middle age, one woman, probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">"is he a collector, do I ask?"</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 slabs."</seg>
<seg id="17">"these records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him home), dress the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason he has such a considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford than they appeared and again bought items he sold when he was young and broke."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70's, which appeared when I was 11 or 12."</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees that those who buy records are more introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds:" I don't smoke and I don't drink much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">"WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers whom he meets will apply to the YouGov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, he has also noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media group, people who have heard about the comeback and are forced to buy their old records again."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from the conversations I have led, people tend to get rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their records to buy their CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom on trailers of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a business like Phonica to recognize that record stores offer a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to Wez, some of the older customers responded to the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some plate fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to get back to the stability of familiar vinyl covers, from objects that wake up happy youth memories."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or property of material possessions as a kind of consolation," says Wez. "</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It's a simple way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "we are like their social workers!" "an employee flicks off a panel stack."</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey by ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to them.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record have no record player."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at this time of the news report, I would probably look very concerned as I scatter on a pile of Bossa Nova compilations."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works at sounds of the Universe (number of people: three men of middle age) has noticed a" "trophy aspect" "of the revival."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone just came in here and said," I don't own a record player, but I would like to buy a Radiohead disk so I can put it on the shelf, "he says."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens."</seg>
<seg id="41">"more product-proof, less music-class."</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I don't have a record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not older ones, who only slowly enter."</seg>
<seg id="44">"Fopp, dedicated to the records of almost a whole floor, has a colourful audience when I go in."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women."</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts New Year's newest synthesize and sexery pop instead of experimental jazz groans from the loudspeakers - it's good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them looks strange, but nailing psychological trauma is hard to detect if you stand beside someone for 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, has been running in business for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">It makes a window bumblebee as a big shopping.</seg>
<seg id="50">"it doesn't deserve much, so collecting boards is not a real option, she says."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in another way, but the beauty of records is..." "</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of plate lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I look at the jeans pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls, who are grouping themselves around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and daughter think about buying a Crosley record player."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left is a staircase, a wall full of panels of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"no one looks at them - perhaps, because they are only purely decorative, some so far up that it is impossible to touch them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that any attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and some customers could send in the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain about."</seg>
<seg id="60">"it is no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even if my research shows that the results of YouGov vote, they leave, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors, who exist in reality, record stores and online forums."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they spend their thursday tomorrow with security not with the bumble through record shops of Berwick Street and the sheets through records, while avoiding the staring gaze of an uncanny, 30-year-old false presenter who shakes no clustering men of middle-age over the shoulders."</seg>

<seg id="2">"a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Calais jungle in which thousands of refugees live."</seg>
<seg id="3">"in a trial hearing this week, the authorities argued in Calais that the state should be authorized to sell 72 provisional businesses in which individuals within the bearing sell goods, cigarettes to Energydrinks, sell, offer hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the Calais prefecture has argued that these places should be demolished, because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid, and that have a fire and health risk."</seg>
<seg id="5">"humanitarian groups told the court that shops and restaurants were important, as the free meals offered by the state-supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="6">They also concluded that temporary shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">"a court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who operate the 72 provisional businesses, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were absolutely understandable."</seg>
<seg id="8">"judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than merely feeding people living in extremely precarious conditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">"one of the places that was threatened by the decline was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the Camp, which is operated in vain and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as a consultation on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="11">"more than 170,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in a letter to the Guardian, it was said that the closing" "for these children would be a catastrophe, of which the youngest eight years old are."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the two aid organizations" "Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants" "estimated on Friday that the number of migrants in the Dschungellager rose to more than 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in new arrivals during the summer."</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Britain at the 7-er Rugby came to an abrupt halt on Thursday evening at the final hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were struck here in Rio with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Fiji distributed a master class in handling, side-stepping, back-back, line and roher power to win gold - her first Olympic medal of any color."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the defeat was lost due to the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall on them in the final."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but regardless of this, Fiji would have struck a 15-man team in the form of this form."</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for GB - but will probably not - that at least one Brite tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon. "</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind it.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago they lost each game at Adelaide Sevens under Ryan.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they only lose one.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this hatch will hurt, but progress is amazing."</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started wonderful and left the attacks GBs out of fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">"the World Series winners went 5-0 upwards, when Osea Kolinisau moved in the corner."</seg>
<seg id="14">"after four minutes of playing time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner, which he converted."</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">"a hack of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Sierra Leone Nakarawa to achieve a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji."</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute there was a touchdown in the right corner and there was 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new whistle and there was still a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou competed by further weak Tacklings of the UK team and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">"it's like Fiji was born to play 7, while GB is still learning."</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">"GB introduced fundamental changes to the half-time and closed the fijian gap... for a whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua Tuisova went through to a brilliant intermediate play of Fiji."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went for a long time in favor of the South Sea sulphians, whose fans cheered, flags and danced on the tribune."</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire Fijis's playful approach.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">"the whistle sounded, the Fijis embraced and GTC kicked crushing into the grass."</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the day Fiji Japan defeated Japan in the semifinals with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa in a tight semi-finals match from the race - Britain's conversion of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Kyle Brown brought the Boks to the front in the first half, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive footwork and scored a score among the posts in the second half."</seg>
<seg id="30">"a brilliant late Tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team secured the win - and thus the silver medal."</seg>

<seg id="3">"from the first rudder to the last, 220 Hard Hieve who enter the story, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning at their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa."</seg>
<seg id="4">"even though there were only those who sat at the helm, there were three voices in the boat."</seg>

<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer that is operable and they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">"if you do not do that, it spreads everywhere."</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a bit the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the trio was lucky that he was able to begin treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if that is the right concept at all."</seg>
<seg id="15">"I needed money, so I had to get better soon."</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">"I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice."</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it starts.</seg>
<seg id="19">"rowing in itself is a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one."</seg>

<seg id="21">"panning, which was a captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, said" "I was an emotional wreck this week. that's a bit extreme, but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">It only repeats how much I and Helen and Robin have worked for.</seg>
<seg id="23">It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">"without Robin we would be no one, so a massive thanks goes to him. he is the best coach in the world."</seg>
<seg id="25">I couldn't have wished for a better person for training or a better coach.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning lost no race over the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to close, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve."</seg>
<seg id="29">We were caught very at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Helen called" "stay in the process, stay in the process." ""</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important not to let yourself be carried away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not looking forward to doing something great.</seg>
<seg id="33">"today we didn't want fireworks, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race what we did."</seg>

<seg id="35">Glover has to appear next week on a wedding in her own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that it was my last race.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have meant too much pressure.</seg>

<seg id="5">"some time ago, it meant that the original sound was part of the Bayerischer Rundfunk's contribution."</seg>
<seg id="6">Little later the water forum of the government of Unterfranken strangled the association.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the work of the Veitenstein group was" "Bavarian" "as exemplary."</seg>
<seg id="8">"behind all this, Rupert Göller, who was a member of the Zweckverband employee for 31 years, was 28 years as managing director."</seg>
<seg id="9">Now he was retired at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="10">"the drinking water-purpose association of the VeitensteinGroup, based in Kottendorf, municipality Breitbrunn, promotes annually about 150,000 cubic metres of water and provides 32 locations and hamlet with approximately 5500 inhabitants."</seg>

<seg id="14">"his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organisation activities, budget planning, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends," said the chairman. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"as outstanding events, it called the inauguration and inauguration of the new wells (1994), land purchases in the area of the new wells (1998) and compensation for farmers, the refurbishment of a central computer control (2004), and the renewal of water pipes."</seg>
<seg id="16">"there has been no standstill, and you have always added innovations, because water is life-consuming and drinking water is the most important food."</seg>
<seg id="17">"in her laudatio, she praised Göllers loyal, reliable and correct service for over 31 years."</seg>
<seg id="18">He has worked with a lot of heart blood for his water-purpose association and he has lived the water-purpose association correctly as if it were his own company.</seg>
<seg id="19">"a few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the VeitensteinGroup on nitrate lowering in front of the water forum of the Lower Franconia district."</seg>

<seg id="21">"Rupert Göller, for his part, praised Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years."</seg>
<seg id="22">He is the best water man and he was a faithful boy.</seg>
<seg id="23">Together we were an unbeatable team.</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - flashlight for German steel industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-packed and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared by additional costs in millions of dollars.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens threatened by the industry from green electricity production are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it remains at the release of the Renewable Energy Transition in the existing plants for so-called own electricity production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the" Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung "(WAZ, Friday edition)."</seg>
<seg id="5">I'm really happy that we could finally reach that after two years of tough negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="6">"accordingly, the European Commission had initially planned to ask the steel producers to use the gases from the blast furnace for electricity generation for their own consumption."</seg>
<seg id="7">"according to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year."</seg>
<seg id="8">Gabriel told the WAZ that there is now a basic agreement with the EU Commission after talks with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">"only when generators are replaced in the steel plants, an EEG conversion rate of 20 percent is required."</seg>
<seg id="10">But also this will not be levied in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the European Commission for self-power production.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in this way, the status quo of the previous regulation will be largely written."</seg>
<seg id="13">Gabriel's successful efforts are of particular significance for the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="14">"with regard to our campaign" steel is the future, "this is a first step."</seg>
<seg id="15">"more must follow." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"also in the reform of the emissions legislation, climate and employment targets are to be weighed," says IG Metall-CEO Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt. "</seg>
<seg id="17">The steel industry in Europe has suffered overcapacity and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the past year, the situation escalated further, when the world's largest producer of electricity produced massive steel on the world market in view of the weakening domestic demand."</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers are throwing price dumping into Chinese steel companies.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the course of this spring, the situation has somewhat relaxed."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on the one hand, flawed import duties on import steel effect, on the other hand, the economic prospects in China have risen."</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how sustainable the price pick-up is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry leader Thyssenkrupp was cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">"last but not least, the prices had rather stagnated."</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">"at the end, ThyssenKrupp also did not want to exclude the closure of individual works."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the German steel industry, around 86,000 people were employed at the end of 2015."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in July, despite rising prices and increasing orders, German steel manufacturers remain cautious."</seg>
<seg id="29">"with 3.4 million tonnes, they produced good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year, as the Steel Business Association announced on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="30">"after a short increase in May, the quantity produced now went back to each other for the second month."</seg>
<seg id="31">"since the beginning of the year, production has fallen by two percent below the previous year's figure."</seg>

<seg id="1">"community, spirit, health: singing is good for seniors"</seg>
<seg id="2">"singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp for her whole life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, in the Lehramt study she occupied the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors choir."</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing inspires me emotionally and physically," she describes. "</seg>
<seg id="4">"after a rehearsal she feels balanced, cheerful and more alive, she says."</seg>
<seg id="5">"by the way, she does something good with her health and spirit."</seg>
<seg id="6">"singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler from the German senior league."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, describes Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="8">"through regular meetings, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts."</seg>
<seg id="9">Often social and family structures dissolve in old age; a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" to speak and organize, to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"singing can be strenuous in the positive sense, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="12">"for doing so, seniors train deep and controlled breathing."</seg>
<seg id="13">Anyone who regularly demands his lungs doesn't get out of the box too quickly in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">"even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice in age, singing is an optimal hobby."</seg>
<seg id="15">"elderly people often have a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Labour Association of the Seniors Organizations."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the older generations, joint singing had a much higher significance, it was part of everyday life, both in school and leisure time."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs awakes many memories in older people, often associated with positive feelings of her youth."</seg>
<seg id="18">"through lyrics and especially melodies, people with dementia care about long-lying events."</seg>
<seg id="19">"when singing, a special performance is required for the head, Lenz explains."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, concentrate on one's own voice and a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge."</seg>
<seg id="21">"especially older people, who live alone, practice so not only to concentrate on themselves."</seg>
<seg id="22">"another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Also the self-esteem grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">"to show oneself: if I practise for a long time, I get better and alert beyond me - this experience strengthens."</seg>
<seg id="26">"good reasons to start singing, so there is enough."</seg>
<seg id="27">"those who want to try out a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks they have little talent, Lenz advises."</seg>
<seg id="28">"you don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who can hear when a sound is next to it?"</seg>
<seg id="29">"looking for the suitable offer, senior citizens have different options, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="30">"when someone sings of the circle of acquaintances in a seniors choir, one can simply connect."</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer views of choirs in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or the church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">"if you don't have access to the Internet, your family, friends or neighbours can ask for help with Internet research."</seg>
<seg id="35">"if you want to sing, you should necessarily join a choir, advises Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing is good for the soul and has something liberating - that is true for any age.</seg>

<seg id="8">She is the author of the study published on this Friday in the magazine "BMC Evolutionary Biology."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in a previous investigation, the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the kittens cries out with the urgency of their neediness."</seg>
<seg id="10">A total of nine adult males and eight queens were observed from the animal husbandry of the MHH.</seg>
<seg id="11">They were played for a call of small children who were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and separated from the mother and siblings.</seg>
<seg id="12">"on the other hand, they were confronted with screams of more excited kittens, which were raised in addition."</seg>
<seg id="13">"despite the small sample, the researchers keep their results meaningful."</seg>
<seg id="14">"all females, even those who did not have their own offspring, reacted differentially to the screams," Konerding said. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"they turned faster to the loudspeaker, when this reputations of the more excited kitten played."</seg>
<seg id="16">This ability may be congenital or develop with sexual maturity.</seg>

<seg id="5">"it is still unclear whether the further explosions on holiday island Phuket and in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chomphe are also affected by Austrian citizens."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities, such as Schnöll."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the Hua Hin, located approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok, initially exploded two bombs on Thursday evening in a life quarter."</seg>
<seg id="8">"according to the police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, among them the Austrians, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians."</seg>
<seg id="9">"on Friday morning two explosions went up again, and another man was killed according to the authorities."</seg>
<seg id="10">"even from Phuket, a bomb explosion was reported in the morning."</seg>
<seg id="11">"at Detonation near the popular beach of Patong, a taxi driver was injured after police instructions."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in Surat Thani on the south-east coast of the country, another bomb exploded, killing an urban employee."</seg>
<seg id="13">"according to the authorities in a flower beet, the explosives had gone to the air in front of the precinct of the coastal police."</seg>
<seg id="14">"finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-west coast and in Chomphe on the south-east coast demanded several injured."</seg>
<seg id="15">"one goes from a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, called it."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the bomb attacks carry the same handwriting," "said army general Danai Kritamavee Friday morning to journalists."</seg>
<seg id="17">We assume that it is a coordinated attack.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it is too early to express themselves to possible motives, but probably it is a matter of the actions of Muslim rebels."</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to recognise a pattern typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not related to the Islamist insurrection or international terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is only local sabotage, limited to limited areas and provinces," said a spokesman in Bangkok. "</seg>
<seg id="22">Rather they assume that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military junta were laid.</seg>
<seg id="23">"in recent days, the authorities would have kept secret references to upcoming attacks in the south of the country, but they were not informed of the exact time and places."</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">"the police instructed their officials across the country to strengthen security around important government buildings, airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in Thailand, there are still smaller bombings again, but mostly they do not address tourists."</seg>
<seg id="27">In Hua Hin is a palace that was used over years by Thailands king Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">"according to the current bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends its homepage to follow the instructions given by the Thai security authorities."</seg>
<seg id="29">"high security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and surroundings."</seg>
<seg id="30">"after confrontations between security forces and Muslim populations, the necessary trips to these provinces will be cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="31">Increased safety risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday were made a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution issued by the junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This gives the military great influence over the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="34">"Junta boss and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the bombs were an attempt to create chaos, while the country is moving towards stability, improving economic conditions and tourism."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the military unta, who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody unrest, would benefit himself to restore the kingdom to stability and order."</seg>
<seg id="36">"however, it is not possible for the military to get a grip on the uprising of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years."</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6500 people were killed in the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="38">"just about a year ago, in Bangkok at an attack on a popular Hindu shrine, 20 people were killed - most of them foreign tourists."</seg>

<seg id="20">"it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - by certain persons who are extremist, will change their direction and become so extremist."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the decisive factor, therefore, is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party."</seg>
<seg id="22">This is not recognizable.</seg>
<seg id="23">"with a view to the marked increase in legal offences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugees, Maate said he would not yet speak of new right terrorism in this regard."</seg>
<seg id="24">But over the past few years we have found that there can be justifiable structures.</seg>
<seg id="25">There was the group 'Old School Society' or the free group.</seg>
<seg id="26">"it may well be that other right-wing groups or small groups are planning attacks against asylum seekers, against refugee camps or attacks from other right-wing extremist motives."</seg>
<seg id="27">But a nationwide or Europe-wide control of right-wing terrorism is not recognizable.</seg>
<seg id="28">The previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="29">"worried, Maate expressed that many attacks went to the account of people who did not appear in the right scene before."</seg>
<seg id="30">This is worrying.</seg>
<seg id="31">"many of the suspects on asylum accommodations have not previously been known as criminals, politically motivated offences or followers of the right scene."</seg>
<seg id="32">"so many people have committed crimes that have had nothing to do with right-wing extremists who might have been politically indifferent or elected for example, CDU, SPD or left, which, however, have become radicalised by right-wing extremist moods."</seg>

<seg id="2">The Olympic Games or World Records do not always determine the headlines at the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">This shows the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">"at the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmers from Ethiopia slowly swam so slowly that it was temporarily no longer visible in the TV pictures."</seg>
<seg id="5">It simply disappeared - no matter how far the neckline was selected.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in social networks, Habte became a viral internethite."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in fact, the 24-year-old finished his race with a return of 48 seconds and finished the 59th place of 59 starters."</seg>
<seg id="8">But it was rather his not just sporty character that attracted the attention of the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why does the 24-year-old still participate in the Olympics?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian got a special startright from the international swimming association.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to make swimming in underrepresented countries more well-known.</seg>
<seg id="12">"since most athletes are running in Ethiopia, Habte wanted to do something different."</seg>
<seg id="13">Preparation is everything: ROBEL Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.</seg>
<seg id="14">Quickly the first nicknames made the lap.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some media referred to him as "robel of the whale."</seg>
<seg id="16">"based on a" "prosperity" "the English tabloid" "The Sun" "made fun of him with" "Dad Bod". ""</seg>
<seg id="17">"his time, he only struck a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter Freestyle, played no role."</seg>
<seg id="18">Comparisons with Eric the Eel were also drawn.</seg>
<seg id="19">"at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Eric Moussambani took care of media attention."</seg>
<seg id="20">"unforgettable was the appearance of the swimmers from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to stand alone in a pre-race over 100 meters of Freestyle."</seg>
<seg id="21">Moussambani was fired at that time.</seg>
<seg id="22">The 22-year-old learned to swim only eight months before the Olympic Games and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.</seg>

<seg id="7">The Chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board Arno Mahlert already leaves the Supervisory Board with effect on 12 September.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the management board of the Executive Board already handed over the previous board member Gerhard Hausruckinger on September 1, 2013."</seg>

<seg id="1">"as of October 1, 2016, the fees per cubic metre of wastewater amount to 2.10 euros for the area of the sewage plant Neudorf / Reuth / Welfare 3.36 Euro (previously 2.26 euros) and for Azendorf 3.64 euros (up to now 2.18 euros)."</seg>
<seg id="2">"at the plant in Azendorf, the wastewater fee will then increase again at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are necessary."</seg>
<seg id="3">"after an overdose calculation, the wastewater price in Azla will then be at 4.37 euros per cubic metre."</seg>
<seg id="4">"as Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, in the approval of the household by the District Office Kulmbach, it was found that subcoverings run for these sewage systems."</seg>
<seg id="5">"due to legal foundations, the market of Kasendorf is obliged to operate the equipment cost-effectively."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as of October 1, 2016, citizens and trade and industrial companies from Welfare, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to intervene more deeply into the purse."</seg>
<seg id="7">The fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">"as Head of Administration Herbert Schmidt showed the committee, a new calculation of fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- and underwear from the previous calculation period were to be compensated."</seg>
<seg id="10">Schmidt explained the serious fee increases that there are relatively small establishments with a very low waste water attack in all three sewage plants with a very low waste water attack which is between 6800 and 12000 cubic metres per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">"as a result of the low distribution basis, for example, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have serious effects."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in addition, the wastewater volume in all three plants is slightly declining."</seg>
<seg id="13">"furthermore, due to their age refurbishment and repair expenses, there was a significant increase in the underlying calculation period for all three plants."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the plant in Azendorf is nearly 30 years old, the plants for Welfare, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years."</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced on the basis of a damage in the sewage plant in Azendorf.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the pumping station Welfare, the almost 20 years old conveyor systems had to be overhauled from the ground up and the first sewage pond had to be dissipated after nearly 20 years, the sewage sludge disposed of and an additional ventilation facility had to be installed in order to comply with the water-legal requirements in the future."</seg>
<seg id="17">Schmidt: "these extraordinary expenses resulted in the continued supervision and maintenance costs that have to be taken into account in the new calculation period.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the same applies to electricity costs, which were significantly below the current level during the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012."</seg>
<seg id="19">Stone houses made it clear that in the low waste water supply in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance were completely smashed.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in doing so, Schmidt, the market community of major entertainment costs in the wastewater facilities in the past 20 years, has been spared."</seg>
<seg id="21">"after the view of stone houses, the situation for the mentioned plants will continue to remain precarious, especially since the supply area of the Friesenbachtal sewage-purpose association could not be extended because it is a deficit."</seg>

<seg id="2">"snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say that it is insensitive to races."</seg>
<seg id="3">"with its filtering tool, Snapchat allows around 150 million daily users to change the reality and to play with identities in such a way that already borders the absurd."</seg>
<seg id="4">"you can transform yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the filters are blended, self-rotating tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day."</seg>
<seg id="6">All missteps arrive to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">"snapchat filters have drawn criticism in the past, in which they were charged that the app would promote black face promoting or white skin as a beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="8">"as this week some users suggested a filter which gave them slotted eyes, false teeth and bloated cheeks, some critics called a racist caricature of Asians -" Yellow-face. ""</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a larger problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">"the news and outrage were widely distributed on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced that it would have disabled the feature."</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was designed as homage to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who have experienced racism reminded the filter of hurting clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in an e-mail Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweets were widely spread over the photos, was that the filter was" hurtful "and said to be unpleasant."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgusting Asian caricature and filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">"it shows that the filter is not yellow-sighted, but that the yellow face has been pulled into the projecting extreme."</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural triviate.</seg>
<seg id="18">"American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand."</seg>
<seg id="19">And snapchats big audience of young people - who are more different in terms of race than their older counterpart - could be more likely to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">"when one of Snapchats filters creates a picture that is insulting for a user," "it is much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed when it was earlier," "said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on Thursday, Zhu, who worked as Product Manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete her snapshot account, asked others to do the same."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview, she said she believes that racial-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in the settings of Snapchat."</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu also criticized the large part white and only male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no representation of people with other skin colors in their staff so they can make such decisions," said the Chinese Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable in order to say something about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">"others share their mind, a complaint that has left Snapchat largely unanswered."</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish any numbers on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.</seg>
<seg id="27">"on Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural background of its employees, but according to a subscriber, the company recently recruited a personnel officer who focuses on sub-represented population groups and on internal integration efforts."</seg>
<seg id="28">"Zhu also said they will leave their Snapchat account and added," I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.K.. "</seg>

<seg id="2">"military personnel of the United States Central Command turned out intelligence information to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, as it would have allowed the actual conditions on site, reported an investigation committee of the Congress in a report on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the preliminary report, created by a Task Force of Republican Members of the Military Committee, Secret Service Committees and the Defense Organizing Committee, reports of great discontent among Central Command Intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="4">"central Command, short cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, that controls U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia."</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence information, which was typically done by high-ranking CentCom commanders, regularly recorded a more positive image of the American efforts against terrorism as the actual states were allowed on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services," "published a newspaper article."</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," "stated Ken Calvert, republican member of the House of Representatives."</seg>
<seg id="7">The management errors in the Centcom range up to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report highlights detailed problems during the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">"although there is no direct evidence suggesting that governmental peaks have given instructions under Obama to change the reports, it shows how analysts exposed the pressure from their superiors, a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL."</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015, many Central Command Press releases, statements and statements in front of the congress were clearly more positive than the facts presented." "</seg>
<seg id="11">"for example, a CentCom member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could begin in April or May 2015."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Mosul, second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigation, so much is clear." "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement."</seg>
<seg id="14">"from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the leaders of Central Command have changed the intelligence reports to downplay the danger of ISIS in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force to live after being admitted that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings while the investigations will continue.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in addition, the CentCom reports are under way through the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defence."</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday that coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican task force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015, the CentCom has created an overly restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," announced the highest ranking democrat in the committee, member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, in a statement. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"this process, so Mr. Schiff," delayed the publication of intelligence reports, "accused the morality of analysts and" gave too little room for dissenting opinions. "</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no clue to the intervention of the White House at CentCom analysts in terms of a "definite political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the proceedings of the Congress were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">"last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon general inspector who received after complaints by CentCom analysts."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, admitted that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the reports of the Congress, while the inspectors were still under way."</seg>
<seg id="25">"but he also indicated that" experts sometimes have diverging opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defence welcomed a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence. "</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations also have repercussions on the question of a successful air campaign under US leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion that has meanwhile been made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).</seg>
<seg id="27">"however, the accusations of last year raised the question to what extent President Obama can rely on the Central Command for an honest assessment of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State evoked the interactivity of more than ten years ago, as a CentCom analyst, Gregory Hooker, had written a written document about how the former government under George W. Bush had only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion."</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the insurrection against current reporting on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">"last year, the team led Mr. Hooker, according to government officials, that contrary to the statements of the government airstrikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State, no significant impact on the terrorist group's financial situation could have been, as these prohibitions would have been put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market."</seg>
<seg id="31">"this knowledge, however, was not published, the Times reported in September."</seg>
<seg id="32">"Centres damaliger commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature because of his overly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate."</seg>

<seg id="10">"as always, the game will go out on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising vortices through their success story, four years after they landed in the last London Games on the last of 12 places."</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">"she grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and for the first time with three years she had played a hockey player (her two older sisters played the Sport at Drexel University), with 16 years she became National Player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team."</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the Olympics in 2008 because she couldn't qualify for the cadre.</seg>
<seg id="14">"then came the year 2012, in which everything went wrong for her and her team."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in the following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, coach of the national team, began to turn things into a better."</seg>
<seg id="16">"a change of culture, a mental change and a physical change," Bam said. "</seg>
<seg id="17">We didn't have the workload in London that we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We can rip the rudder completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the Torreigen in the first half of the game with a backlash out of the local area.</seg>
<seg id="20">"India had gone into the game without victory, but the team showed itself surprisingly tough and held the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands."</seg>
<seg id="21">"she performed a sprint with the flat ball on the left flank, then pulled into the middle and knocked the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2-0 lead."</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">"the Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the US goalkeeper, Jackie Briggs, who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games."</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position," said Parnham, but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday. "</seg>

<seg id="1">"in the midst of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampolines"</seg>
<seg id="2">"wherever you are, how late it is, it is the Olympics."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the events in Rio de Janeiro feel steady and inevitable, a rapid relay between competition and aspiration."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which is passed from the crossbow to swimmers to the gymnast for triathletes."</seg>
<seg id="5">"you can't turn on TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the coffee shop, without hearing Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a swarm of women with dimples, could well have been among these known names that would be sent to Prime Time, set up by sponsors and well-being TV advertising, if he would be a swimmer, gymnast or even fencers."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights gold in the olympic trampolines."</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the center, partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally accepted: pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast swim and may rule it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I have a modest argument for my particular favourite, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the trampoline bed has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it was so sparse the last 16 years that many who asked me did not know that it was an Olympic sport at all."</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"although the USA sent athletes to compete, it has never won a medal in the trampoline jumping and until 2012 had had an athlete, who made it to the final round."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians are inclined to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the jumping on the trampoline has a certain outsider character, partly because it sounds suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clownsschule as the one for the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a devout enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has humorous potential - the cartoonical trembling of his never-ending bounce - but also the grace of gymnastics and dove, the two sports that essentially unite."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the word" "trampoline" "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline which means as much as the springboard."</seg>
<seg id="22">"aspiring champions jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to land a series of falling movements (turning, cock and salts) before they land on their feet."</seg>
<seg id="23">"according to the official Olympic programme, they are assessed according to version, difficulty level and" flight time. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">"medallists in their quest for gold continue to go faster, up and down, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes up and down, up and down at the playground."</seg>
<seg id="27">"they hunt not only the finish line or the original wall, but also another high goal in the television broadcast: the world or the Olympiad."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the goal-oriented pursuit is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it's enough to even touch a spectator with tears."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I feel fatigued when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward motion is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">"he or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly upward."</seg>
<seg id="34">"there is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity."</seg>
<seg id="35">It's as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can be.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the qualification and final rounds of the women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00."</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the end-hours as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in the midst of the Olympia-Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in general turmoil."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if the rise of consciousness can only be achieved by the fear and the objectification of male athletes - as the male US Turner suggested recently, Mr. Dooley expects his new fan base to return to air."</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the USA "</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators calling for political changes in Ethiopia were hit by the government's violent resistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that dozens of protesters were killed during the clashes with the police at gunshot.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just collapsing?</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries of Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">"but over the past few months, protests against the government troubled the country and spread to more and more areas."</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people stormed down the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"according to human rights organisations, the government's response was ruthless."</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that policemen shot and killed on umpteen unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">"circulating videos on the protests, which are probably from the last or early of this year, show how security people hit young people with sticks while they were forced to make a handstand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights Council now demands a detailed investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," "said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group."</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorism across the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much Western help."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the roads are usually quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted, with dissidents effectively silenced."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent into exile or in prison, killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and have no other options except to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopian. "</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protests.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from the use of land to stranglehold with regard to the power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"following a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, tensions continue along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line challenged hundreds of lives in June."</seg>
<seg id="28">"analysts fear that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of Ogaden, which have been forced more or less in recent years, exploit the turbulence and arm themselves again."</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness can now explode under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only in recent years, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate through the social media, as cheaper smartphones have become increasingly common and improved Internet services."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, doing what it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people still can communicate via internet proxies that hide where they are."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians gave an indication that they were so protesting.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"for eons of eons, the Amharas, who mainly come from Ethiopia, prospered in politics and the economy, while they exploited the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and living in lowland areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But that also changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are coordinating under a umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which accounts for about 6 per cent of the population and dominant in the military, secret services, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the rest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr Meles, a former rebel leader, had until his death on a non-publicized illness in 2012 17 years of Ethiopian prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was regarded as a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly well versed in recognizing early signs of discontent and using special officers to process opponents and to make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime lacks this basic skill," "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst."</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively untransparent reasons to take the position of Mr Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time that Ethiopia was experiencing such a upheaval in 2005, after thousands of polls protested, according to analysts, apparently stolen by the government and then stolen."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the ensuing raids many protesters were killed, even if there were less than in the last months and this time of unrest passed relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"the development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and for their measurable progress in poverty alleviation."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not hinder the intensification of the internal resentment of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it accepts a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month, protesters in Gondar, an ampersian city, attacked by Tigray and the hatred towards the Tigray becomes more and more common in the social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests will bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflug to the neighboring Somalia, even if it recently announced that it closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West wants to support democracy clearly, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile region."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," "said Mr Abdi," "is a very thin tightrope walk."</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his claim Obama had founded ISIS was "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">"Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his multiple repeated claim, President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the" founders "of the terrorist group Islamic State, not serious."</seg>
<seg id="3">"this clarification raised new questions about the communication skills of the Republicans, whether he was able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it also brings out its comrades who endeavour to take protection during an eventful phase, into the peculiar position to explain statements that he could not have meant."</seg>
<seg id="5">"having done the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump withdrew in terms of the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to interpret, the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS."</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning Tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the tweet was the opposite to the previous day, where Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he said the accusation was completely serious."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when the conservative Radiomorator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump to weaken the statement by recalling that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know about it."</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism sneaks down on Mr. Trump while trying to steer the focus of his campaign on account of falling survey values on the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton kept talking about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump again tried to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">"using Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their words boring."</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">"at the end of July he felt strong criticism when he said that the Russians were to hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he explained" "Of course I thought the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then return to demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans as they arrive, and then, if necessary," clarify "according to how the reaction drops." said Ruth sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates. "</seg>
<seg id="17">"however, I believe he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways."</seg>
<seg id="18">"instead of defusing the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump assumed an even more corrosive tone as his survey values declined further."</seg>
<seg id="19">"a new survey conducted by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was published on Friday, showed a great lead in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida."</seg>
<seg id="20">"while Mr. Trump generally tries not to apologize for his provocative statements, he frequently accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humour."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but while he focuses on the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumpeter Scherze have brought his loyal companions into the uncomfortable situation of having to stand to him regardless of how provocantly his statements may be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent advocates, tried to defend the candidate in a CNN interview from Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political commentaries," Mr. Giuliani said he was questioned about Mr. Trumps's statements, whether Mr. Obama and Clinton had founded the Islamic State. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"it is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization he called it rear-hangers, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to spread the situation in the Middle East aggressively under control."</seg>
<seg id="26">"before the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of being rousing against him on each of his words."</seg>
<seg id="27">"he mocked the poor, miserable" TV experts trying to understand him and said, "You can't!." "</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the democrats ridiculed Mr. Trump's excuse as just another proof that he was unfit for the presidency.</seg>

<seg id="8">"a revived verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="10">Coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing employee of the old cafes, the owner and managing director of the new café."</seg>
<seg id="12">He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">"when a client offered to provide funds for a new branch office, he was excited to do it, he said."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot."</seg>
<seg id="15">Verb uses the same distributor for bagels bought the same espresso machine model.</seg>
<seg id="16">It even uses the same lights from the old verb.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment.</seg>
<seg id="18">He introduced new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">"on the menu there are sandwiches with bacon and cheese, and there are garnishes such as capers and sauced onions."</seg>
<seg id="20">There are natural rice dishes.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the café serves no more beer, but there are fresh juices."</seg>
<seg id="22">"after nine months, Rodriguez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers."</seg>
<seg id="23">"many old customers were also pushed by prices from Williamsburg," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"recently, on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer."</seg>
<seg id="25">"Oliveira, 34, lived in Williamsburg in former times and visited the club regularly."</seg>

<seg id="1">The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a rich meal"</seg>
<seg id="2">"in March 1933, shortly after his rise to the President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office."</seg>
<seg id="3">"as a gourmet, President Roosevelt had a faible for refined delicacy of Fifth Avenue like Pâte de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup."</seg>
<seg id="4">"its menu on that day was somewhat more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, potato puree and as dessert a plum pudding."</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Brickman. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"her husband Andrew Coe added," "It was also a message to the Americans how to eat them."</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Coes last book" "Chop Suey" "was about Chinese cuisine in the USA, while brick was told in her book" 97 Orchard "about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from the food perspective."</seg>
<seg id="9">"her latest collaboration," A decent meal, "which will be published on Tuesday at Harper Verlag illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="10">"they showed culinary solidarity as they meet with a reporter in the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small snack in the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929."</seg>
<seg id="11">"brick, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive rolls, while Coe, 57, turkey with potato purée and vegetable mixture ate."</seg>
<seg id="12">"when the reporter ordered Hackers, this found the couple appropriate for a discussion about food in the era of Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich foods were very popular," "said Brickman."</seg>
<seg id="14">"there were peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread."</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and some cheap that stretches the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve as dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">CoE grinning.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it must have settled in the stomach like lead," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American budget, especially in rural areas, an All-You Can Eat Buffet."</seg>
<seg id="20">"teams of women cooked for male fellows and it was served freshly baked pate for breakfast, lunch and dinner."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War." "a Square Meal" "records the ways in which the country was surrounded by no longer the land of land."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it was a time when food for the Americans became a central, tense theme," Coe explained why he and his wife wanted to write about it. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"the new budget was just as tense: mysterious food such as breads and casseroles became staple food, the Kasserolle regained as a" "wonderful way to reuse food residues," "said Brickman, as cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce."</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper drywall.</seg>
<seg id="25">"meat, which was the center of American cuisine for many years, became a rare serene luxury."</seg>
<seg id="26">"strange mixtures were tried, as a calorie-rich and nutritious satisfaction prevailed over taste or even wholesome kitchen sense."</seg>
<seg id="27">"during their research for the book, which also includes recipes, brick was made from this period, baked onions with peanut butter."</seg>
<seg id="28">"it was not a popular addition to lunch," Coe says. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"Ziegelman continues:" "it was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and baked onions don't fit together.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the house recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">"as never before or ever since, budget economists - among them Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - have derailed eating habits of the country."</seg>
<seg id="33">"by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become" housekeepers "and the challenge of converting Pampe like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals."</seg>
<seg id="34">"a Square Meal" is a feast of historical treats.</seg>
<seg id="35">"in particular, the reports of the government's response to starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's Lass-me-Cake-Essen-attitude."</seg>
<seg id="36">"while he publicly praised the simple Iowa Farming cuisine of his kitchen, he spoke like the million-million man of the world he has become."</seg>
<seg id="37">"he liked Continental cuisine as fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said. "</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in an almost gilt dining room and wore a tuxedo.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was a real stranger to reality.</seg>
<seg id="40">"President Roosevelt might have committed the same mistake, if not his wife Eleanor had asked him to make an example with his stomach."</seg>
<seg id="41">"as described in the book, the hypocrisy of a housekeeper with no interest in flavors of Ms Roosevelt suggested that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most controversial."</seg>
<seg id="42">Many of the species from the era of Great Depression that deal with food was discarded as soon as the country returned to the legs.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest vertebrae is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland hair usually occurs only in winter to the surface.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after an investigation on board of the Sanna, this shark was allowed to go back to the sea."</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland-sharks get offspring with 150 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="7">"leisurely, the Greenland shark is floating along the bottom of the North Atlantic, at an hour it reaches just 1,220 metres."</seg>
<seg id="8">"only when it matters, the five-metre-long animal accelerates at a height of 2.6 km / h and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed."</seg>
<seg id="9">"this lifestyle, characterized by slowness, seems to be a godparent for a high age."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal" Science, "at least one Grönlandhai who could be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," commented Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max-Planck-Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates. "</seg>
<seg id="12">The evolutionary biologist suspected that Greenland's hair would be a stone age.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland's sharks are hard to observe, after all, they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in the winter on the surface."</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland's hair.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their slow motion measured them when they equipped six animals with a transmitter from Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, prey makes this sharks: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear."</seg>
<seg id="19">"they may hunt dormant animals or patrol on the bottom of the ice cream, looking for cadaver, which torches from higher water layers."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Julius Nielsen and his colleagues investigated 28 Greenland-sharks, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depths of the North Atlantic."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 cm long, while the biggest 502 centimeter."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in order to determine the age of the animals, they analysed the lens core of the sharks with the carbon-14 method."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eye lens is already born before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained therein will no longer be renewed."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had notably much carbon-14 in the lens core.</seg>
<seg id="25">"therefore, after the early 1960s, their birth should lie as a nuclear weapon hunt larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in the third smallest animal with 220 centimeters in length, the lenticular nucleus, on the other hand, contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the atomic weapons, so it should have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in contrast, all larger Greenland-sharks had normal carbon-14 amounts in their lenticular nucleus, resulting from cosmic rays in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon-14-clock showed an age of 335 years for a 493 centimetre long Greenland shark, while the record shark might be 392 years old at 502 centimeters."</seg>
<seg id="29">"only then, if they are longer than four meters, Greenland-shark-females have been known."</seg>
<seg id="30">"now, the researchers were able to assign an age to the length."</seg>
<seg id="31">"since one of the animals with 392 centimetres probably stood on the threshold of sexually mature and its age was determined 156 years ago, Greenland's hair with the increase obviously can be at least one and a half centuries of time."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusalemes live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale, whose bacon at the neck was a 120-year-old harpoon tip, was caught before Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on sparring flames."</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age more slowly.</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals often become particularly large."</seg>
<seg id="38">"because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses heat."</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than at one gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: they have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal lives therefore more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many offspring as possible as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"a very big animal, on the other hand, should rather invest his resources into a long life."</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministers from the pastoral care unit Eyocal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way to Freiburg on the way to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">"together, four stages were accomplished."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in order to bridge the time to the next Romanesque pilgrimage of all the registrants in two years, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage."</seg>
<seg id="5">"various pilgrimage destinations were examined and one finally decided to visit the Episcopal City of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage destination was offered at Freiburger Münster."</seg>
<seg id="6">"16 Minis, out of Bittelbronn, and Gruol, and Haigerloch, and the holy rooms went their way."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in the evening before, Pastor Storost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrim crosses and shared the pilgrimage."</seg>
<seg id="8">"from Horb we drove by train to the starting point of Villingen, where there was also a Muenster Unserer's wife, and so the Pilgrim was kicked off from Münster."</seg>
<seg id="9">"each day and evening individual day tours were framed by a brief impulse with different prayers, songs and written texts."</seg>
<seg id="10">"but also on the way, the Minis on field crosses, chapels or churches repeatedly made Rast to sing together a song of specially assembled pilgrim song."</seg>
<seg id="11">"for the overnight stays, the local parish priests of the local parish were available."</seg>
<seg id="12">"at the stage destinations, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller were looking for a tasty and strengthening dinner and breakfast."</seg>
<seg id="13">We continued on the second day on Furtwangen to Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the day after, the stage came to St. Peter, which was the most exhausting stretch of road, but had to be lowered at first about 500 meters in the heat of the heat and then climbed again."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in the evening, the deserved reward was a shared barbecue at the bathing pond."</seg>
<seg id="16">"after the morning pulse on the fourth Pilgrim's day in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter, it went to Freiburg on the final stage."</seg>
<seg id="17">"visibly relieved and happy, the Minis met on Freiburg Minster in the late afternoon and walked through the gates of mercy."</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner last night in the men's team sprint in the Velorom in Rio for glory when the British Team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor in which his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made himself Eigen. the legend hauled the legend when he stormed home to get a victory from the favourites of New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">"four years ago England claimed a shocking victory, while Hoy picked the fifth of six Olympic medals."</seg>
<seg id="5">"they repeated the trick, after they held a modest sixth place in March at the World Championships in London in spite of Hoys' resignation."</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as a hindrance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retired creates a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Scotsman that has now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Hindu, Kenny - the four years ago with Hoy wins - and Skinner placed an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds, the New Zealanders won the first round."</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">"after his lap he was almost back, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it."</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a major part of the transformation that went down in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenny and above all Skinner to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Hoy looked at his position as a BBC expert and fell on Skinner, Kenny and Hindes, when they climbed onto the podium."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Glasgow's 23-year-old Skinner said:" "it is a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make a name.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in the final round, we set up an Olympic board and defeated the world champions."</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">"after the triumph in 2012 at the Kennys and Hoys side, Hindu admitted that after a weak start he deliberately fell on the track."</seg>
<seg id="21">He withdrew this statement later and there was no acquittal of England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">"with such a great victory, this time there was no such problem."</seg>
<seg id="23">"he said," "It feels like all the UK flags on the tribune like London."</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We got so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">"this is an event, a gold medal for the nation, winning seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London."</seg>
<seg id="27">If that is a barometer of our progress in the last five months is that we expect successful five days in the cycle current.</seg>
<seg id="28">"with the shape of Kennys, it is possible that he repeated Hoys's victory of three Olympic Gold Medals in a competition."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that would be for Kenny - who was 12 years younger than Hoy, who also was born on March 23 (a apparently holy date for British sports; on the day also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal."</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same from Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Kenny takes part in the sprint next, which starts today and will go for more than three days."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the 28-year-old from Bolton said," "I just enjoy this for the moment."</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a little lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"he said," "If he wins two gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight."</seg>
<seg id="37">"it was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doubles qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometer race."</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived in 3: 51.942.</seg>
<seg id="40">"the world record, which won Gold in 2012, was at 3: 51,659."</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will be held today on the second day of the competition where Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">"yesterday, he had argued with officials before the qualification, when they called him functionaries to measure his height."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in the corresponding women's competition, which will be continued and finished tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowel Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie will be in the world record time in 4: 13,260."</seg>
<seg id="44">The UK team is relying on his strong team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and take a crowd of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">"after a truly extraordinary portrayal of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down."</seg>
<seg id="46">"Dramas played in the background, the resignation of Shane Sutton's technical manager in April in the middle of sexism and bulbings as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton."</seg>
<seg id="47">"however, if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom it looks like the now legendary reputation of GBs, which reached its climax at the perfect moment, will be repeated."</seg>

<seg id="1">Future of Portland smelting due to the elimination of energy demand</seg>
<seg id="2">"the future of the aluminium melt from Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workstations of workers - are on the stake, as the system operator announced the energy supply contract and thereby abolishes all delivery contracts, as the energy company supplying."</seg>
<seg id="3">"this step followed the government's decision at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies for the operation of the plant."</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy for 20 years runs out in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">"up to 2,000 jobs in the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake."</seg>
<seg id="6">Not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in addition, it could come to domino effects as the melt-melt consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victoria."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in 2014, Alcoa completed the point Henry Schmelzer, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power station last year."</seg>
<seg id="9">Alcoa's melt in Portland loses money and risks a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">"this step follows the years of speculation concerning the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant."</seg>
<seg id="11">"AGL, supplying the large aluminium melt with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three other owners will announce their contracts."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the facility is owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp keep smaller shares."</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity by the melt," said the company. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"AGL continued to say that the contracts were called" "hedging business", "which should have entered into force from November 2016."</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12 month notice period so that they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"therefore, AGL assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to the revenues," said the electricity supplier. "</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential effects on the revenues to AGL from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">"AGL announced that the value of the contracts had already depreciated in its annual subscription amount of $187 million, in" anticipation of termination. ""</seg>
<seg id="19">Alcoa said that the decision to book the contracts is the "ability Alcoas... to operate the melt or to ensure the electricity supply to the melt."</seg>
<seg id="20">"the US company said that in 2010 it concluded a 20 year contract with Loy Yang, which should have entered into force from November this year, even if there is yet another explanation why it has resigned from the contract."</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts warn of the poor economic conditions in the industry prior to the possible closure of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in reference to the analysts' statements at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland uses around 600 megawatts and Tomago around 900 megawatts of electricity every year."</seg>
<seg id="23">"if both systems should disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [electricity market]."</seg>
<seg id="24">"and for us as a generating set, that wouldn't be good," he said. "</seg>

<seg id="2">"Kendall Jenner, 20, Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashyan-Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of the US Vogue."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Kendall, the brand ambassador for Estee Lauder and ran to Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday the news on her Instagram account."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover made me cry," "wrote Kendall."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the cover of the cover was a bizarre (or simply keeping up with the Kardashians), a critical reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (with the exception of the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn), as they forgot the cover of their sister and ending with a classic turn: they all have planned a surprise party."</seg>
<seg id="6">"this represents the cliché-hailed plot almost every birthday episode of a children's programme (Seacenter brought the sentence," "You thought we've forgotten you?", "with the honesty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to leave her other girls somehow in this publicity."</seg>
<seg id="7">"with regard to the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of the Kardashians has begun with certainty."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Kendall's great sister Kim likes her, concerning the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were to be seen in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself."</seg>
<seg id="9">The September issue is the most sold issue of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">"with a volume similar to an image book as a fashion magazine, the issue draws a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista were from the 832 pages of the tome 615 pages advertising)."</seg>
<seg id="11">The unveiling of his cover stars is expected to be so eagerly awaited that in the last two years images of the magazine had been scrutinized before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">"women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in recent years there have been clearly more" celebrities who are modeled "as" models, celebrities "on the cover."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Oscar Prize laureate and Dior brand ambassador, Jennifer Lawrence, was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga had the honour."</seg>
<seg id="15">"but even with the small chance that Mrs. Jenner, who is described as the" breakthrough model "of her generation - falls under the earlier category, she is in good company."</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers from today who know how to turn a good snapshot video (even if everything is applicable to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of Lemonade."</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course Jenners does not like success to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="20">"with their reality TV history, Jenners's position in the fashion world has always been somewhat strained."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in June, the former Victoria's Secret-model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized her and called her" the mistletoes of the moment. ""</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings cooked up again when the news came out with the appearing Jenners on the Vogue cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But lashing around on the misfortune seems to pass by at the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.</seg>
<seg id="26">She runs for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">It makes advertising for your primer of Estee Lauder.</seg>
<seg id="28">You and all her sisters sell you pictures of yourself on their respective Paywall apps.</seg>
<seg id="29">She sold her made pictures of Cindy Crawfords's daughter to the magazine WTV.</seg>
<seg id="30">And in her free time she is to be seen in Reality TV. probably only to see her sister Kourtney and her children.</seg>

<seg id="3">The successors dominate the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The unit weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was thicker and bigger, so it was not good in the hand."</seg>
<seg id="6">"on the contrary, it was quite clumsy."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the built-in memory at the beginning was eight megabytes, which would now suffice for about two selfies with high resolution."</seg>
<seg id="8">An iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 gigabytes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"the Nokia 9000 communicator came to the shops exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, into the shops - and it was the first smartphone."</seg>
<seg id="10">"for a few Euros fans can still buy the devices on the internet, but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age."</seg>
<seg id="11">"20 years ago, however, communicator was a sensation."</seg>

<seg id="1">England must steer the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow</seg>
<seg id="2">"Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country."</seg>
<seg id="3">"for me this was the biggest attraction of Heathrow, just as it was in 2012 in London, when we took a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games."</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And this will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">"we already have 10,000 new apprenticeships for our local communities, creating 40,000 new jobs and an end to youth unemployment in the airport."</seg>
<seg id="7">"as they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who think that the challenge of the expansion of Heathrow is too big."</seg>
<seg id="8">I have been told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be blaming ourselves on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">"the doubters had wronged in 2012, and they will lie wrong also at Heathrow."</seg>
<seg id="10">"there are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question asked."</seg>
<seg id="11">"like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not single infrastructure projects."</seg>
<seg id="12">"expansion is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in amusing growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment in both the airport and the UK."</seg>
<seg id="13">"we have a great team in Heathrow, who has implemented a £11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from the T5 - the five year in a row to the world's best airport terminal, until the T2, which was built in the middle of the world's two-busiest catwalks."</seg>
<seg id="14">"now they are ready to deliver a third runway, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment."</seg>
<seg id="15">London's games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that Heathrow's expansion will also be one.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.</seg>

<seg id="1">"Adblock Plus, Facebook in" "Katz and mouse game" "regarding ad blocking"</seg>
<seg id="2">"according to one of the software manufacturers, companies who earn money with online advertising make attempts to bypass ad blocking, a" cat and mouse game. ""</seg>
<seg id="3">"Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that there would block display cases on its desktop page, Adblock Plus published a blog post in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program in order to once again block advertising on the social network."</seg>
<seg id="4">"on Tuesday, Facebook announced that his desktop page would change the encoding of its advertisements in order to make it difficult to recognise the recognition of which part of the advertising page is advertising."</seg>
<seg id="5">But Adblock announced that it found a new way to bypass the new codes.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in a blog post, Adblock Ben Williams" spokesman wrote that "this kind of Hin-and-Her-struggle has been underway between the announcing open source community and the bans since the invention of display blockers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution. "</seg>
<seg id="7">The fact that the world's largest social media company has embarked on the fight is a strong indication of how worrying indicator lamps have become for the industry.</seg>
<seg id="8">"according to a study from the last year of Pagefair and Adobe, around 200 million people worldwide use display blocker; almost four times as much as 2013."</seg>
<seg id="9">"with 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook about their mobile devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of advertisers" ads. "</seg>
<seg id="10">"the company has it based on ad blockers on desktop PCs, as mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook's mobile app for the social network and Instagram, shared a spokesman."</seg>
<seg id="11">Advertising on desktop PCs accounts for a large share of revenues so Facebook appears to be worth the investment of such a step as worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="12">"on Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would update its" "ad preferences tool" "in order to have more control over them than advertising."</seg>
<seg id="13">"on Thursday, Facebook claimed that AdBlocks would be worrying about new filters because they would also block content on the page that are not advertising."</seg>
<seg id="14">"this is not a positive experience for the users, so we plan to address the problem," said a spokesman for Facebook in an e-mail message. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"ad blockers are a blunt tool, which is why we have focused on developing tools such as Ad Preferences, in order to put more control into the hands of people."</seg>

<seg id="2">The victim was lying in the middle of the night on the highway.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the police call on witnesses, after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday passed a suspected suicide of several vehicles on a motorway."</seg>
<seg id="4">The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.</seg>
<seg id="5">"a woman laid herself in the dark" "in an act of despair" "on the street and were hit by several cars, the police said in Vaud."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it is obvious that a Swiss woman, at the age of 49, who was taken over by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill himself."</seg>
<seg id="7">She died on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="8">"several drivers have already been heard, but some have still not been identified, said the police, calling them and any witnesses of the incident to report."</seg>
<seg id="9">"an investigation procedure was opened, which is a" logical "step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter shared the Le Tribune de Geneve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed."</seg>
<seg id="11">Was a collision avoidable?</seg>
<seg id="12">"this is something the prosecutor has to decide," "said Hofstetter."</seg>
<seg id="13">Two similar cases over the last five years show that drivers will not be held accountable.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in each of the two cases - in which a person was running in the dark on the highway, it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian is running in the middle of the night on the highway, as was called in the newspaper."</seg>
<seg id="15">"last year, a policewoman was acquitted of the negligent killing after she had crossed and killed a man who was lying on the A1 in August 2014 near Payerne."</seg>
<seg id="16">The 22-year-old victim had drunk and became unconscious in the street and took judgment.</seg>
<seg id="17">"the court found that the policewoman -- who responded to an emergency call -- was in a justified way, and that the presence of a man on the street was a" completely extraordinary and unforeseeable situation, "the judge said."</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably inhabited once."</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate researchers.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere could once have erdwarlike conditions."</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">"but the latest simulation points out that Venus could have had a thin, erdlike atmosphere, and still slowly rotated."</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the planet probably referred to more dry areas as de Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to accommodate life and protected from rapid evaporation."</seg>
<seg id="9">Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of the Venus exposed their daily side of the sun for almost two months," said GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"this warms the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat."</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures which are some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus that resembles evolution previously suspected by planet researchers.</seg>
<seg id="14">"although it was probably habitable, Venus -- over the course of several billion years - exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light."</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their water vapour was burned away from ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">"as their hydrogen, there remained only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a lethal greenhouse effect -- the Venus, as we know it today."</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.</seg>

<seg id="3">"the new data help astronomers understand why stars in the star cluster rotate to different rates, as well as in which connection the rotational periods are associated with the planet formation."</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that through comparing our results with other star enhouses, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," "said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release."</seg>
<seg id="5">The star-run of the Pleiades lies 445 light-years from the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">"many stars in this Sternenhaufen, which originated some 125 million years ago, are now reaching adulthood."</seg>
<seg id="7">They are now turning the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="8">"at peak rotation rates, these pointless stars repel large amounts of star winds."</seg>

<seg id="10">"when a star is age, its rotation rate begins to slow down."</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognising the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sunspots --.</seg>

<seg id="13">"Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with larger stars on slower pirouettes than smaller ones."</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the" Ballet "of the Pleiades we see that slow rotors tend to be massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," Rebull said. "</seg>

<seg id="5">"before the seventh day of competition, the first official doping cases have become known in Rio de Janeiro."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the Chinese swimmers Chen Xinyi, 3000-meter-obstacle-runner in Silwia Danekova from Bulgaria and Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were positively tested and excluded - immediately before the start of the critically acclaimed Athletics competitions this news came to an end."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in Chen, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide has been proven last Sunday, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances."</seg>
<seg id="8">The International Sports Court (CAS) confirmed their exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon.</seg>

<seg id="14">"also in the night of Rio, the news flew over the positive sample at Danekova, the 33-year-old went on to the offensive."</seg>
<seg id="15">"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," said the Bulgarian TV station BNT. "</seg>

<seg id="1">Theft: so perfide presses hackers their ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">"according to a recent survey by malware defense specialists Malwarebytes of 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past twelve months were at least once, sometimes several victims of an attack with blackmail software."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in Germany, just under 20 percent of companies were already aiming for ransomware blackmail."</seg>
<seg id="5">40 per cent of the victims willingly paid the ransom demanded by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data again.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their blackmail software according to the observations of Malwarebytes based on attacks in corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">"if they are successful there, the potential to express ransom is much higher than with private users."</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a startling fast evolution of the malware," explains Malwarebytes chief Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "World." "</seg>
<seg id="9">"in 2008, most of the Malwareprograms were designed to send advertising."</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">"only private users were the target, but the change to company attacks was scary fast in recent months."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Ransomware works after a simple pattern: once active on a victim's computer, it seeks to search for recently changed files such as Word-, Excel or database files as well as archives of pictures and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and clears the originals in a sustainable way.</seg>
<seg id="14">"subsequently, the software presents the demands of the blackmail."</seg>
<seg id="15">"to get the final key code to the files, the victims have to transfer money - mostly in the form of cryptocurrencies Bitcoin."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but where private users are using the personal photo database on the game, companies are about sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production is shut down."</seg>
<seg id="17">"accordingly, the damage occurs when a ransomware slammed."</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 percent of German companies affected reported net sales losses due to ransomware, 13 percent had to break the business operation completely, in one case people were in danger of life."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Germany, several hospitals already suffered from attacks whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we always say to the victims: don't pay, you only support the problem," says Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies pay their data again.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in view of a standstill in operation, it is difficult for managers to reject the demand of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="23">Hackers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in a recent study, F-Secure safety researchers investigated the use areas and contact with blackmail users and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service in order to take more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they explain their victims by chat, how they can pay via Bitcoin, set free accessible support websites or decode example files for free."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and if private persons are redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros, companies have to negotiate tough and pay five-digit sums to get their data unencrypted."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in view of the potentially high and relatively low risk gains from Ransomware blackmail, hackers are becoming more professional and share the work, says safety expert Chester Wisniewski from the antivirus provider Sophos:" a single person can write a ransomware within a week. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"however, it is more likely that it is about three or four persons."</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software modular system to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">"the malware kits were created by buying malware for themselves, advice and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the scope of supply includes an adjustment tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," Wisniewski says. "</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackers then seek further hackers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service industry.</seg>
<seg id="34">"so, one logs in one of the forums in the underground, buys the set of a criminal and instructs another to install the software on as many PCs as possible."</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made per infected calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually the criminals then instruct Spammer with the dissemination," Wisniewski explains. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"meanwhile, the risk of ransomware is known by many companies that better safeguard their data."</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of companies in the Malwarebytes survey trust Ransomware to be able to repel Ransomware by file-back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">"accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies."</seg>

<seg id="10">"the luggage compartment can be loaded well, but the charging height is 650 mm higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008."</seg>
<seg id="11">"thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm, the tested 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp speeds up the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm."</seg>

<seg id="21">The remote beam assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent speed control responds to the traffic sign recognition and throttles the speed if necessary.</seg>

<seg id="2">"in the evening, one is waking up for hours, at night, one is awake for hours, in the mornings there is no more sleep in the morning before the wake up rang."</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after all, one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about one quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not restful."</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleeping problems or sleep disorders occur?</seg>
<seg id="6">"there are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many causes for them, emphasises Hans-Günter Weeks, member of the board of the German Society for Sleeping Beauty and Sleep Medicine."</seg>
<seg id="7">"what you understand for the time being, however, is the insomnia, so there is a disturbance and dormant disturbance."</seg>
<seg id="8">"as a result, many people feel unsatisfactory or insufficient, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board of the German HomeMedical Association with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel."</seg>
<seg id="9">What's behind sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">"organic, psychological or behavioural factors can be found behind them, but also medicines."</seg>
<seg id="12">"infrequently, the sleeping disorder is an expression of another disease."</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early waking is often frequent in case of depression," "she said."</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors dampen each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">"for example, those who have a herniated disc can lie badly, wake up every two to three hours and possibly start to salve about everyday problems and worries, there is an example."</seg>
<seg id="16">"this leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible."</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I have sleeping problems to the doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">"if you do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and is compromised on the day, you should go to the doctor, advises Weeks."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the impairment can look quite different: one is downcast, tired, sleepy, has difficulties with the attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical discomfort such as stomach or headache."</seg>
<seg id="20">"to alleviate sleep disorder, it is important to find out their causes."</seg>
<seg id="21">"treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, or medications - classic sleep tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - inquired."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the Interdisciplinary Psychological Centre of Charité University Medicine Berlin, has hardly been stressed in Germany."</seg>
<seg id="23">"in case of sleeping problems, one should first contact the family doctor, advises Weeks."</seg>
<seg id="24">It can clarify whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">"who should go to sleep, and what happens?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"for example, for snoring with breathing exercises, in case of disease fatigue, sleep transducers or if one does not find the cause of a disturbance disorder, Fietze explains."</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"just don't make a nap," "says Fietze."</seg>
<seg id="30">"after turning, you go to bed at his normal time."</seg>
<seg id="31">"in addition to the electrodes on the body, one wears nose-glasses, a chest strap and a feeler at the finger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"in addition, a camera records the sleeping-ends on the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="33">How can those affected get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of screws you can get for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">"she counts on: regular sleeping and standing times, not sleeping for too long, not sleeping on the day, not watching TV for falling asleep, avoiding alcohol and not looking at the watch at night - then you start to reckon immediately, and that is quite and certainly not conducive."</seg>

<seg id="1">"the Rigaer Strasse in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not seem like this at first sight, but the police are one of the" "dangerous places" "of the city."</seg>

<seg id="5">"however, articles about this" trendy district, "as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, will be billed with burning cars in recent weeks."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have rented lease agreements, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events."</seg>
<seg id="7">"since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin interior designer Henkel has spoken several times for a hard action by the police against the project, the area called" No-Go-Zone "for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="8">"on June 22, the rooms on the ground floor, the cadet smiths, were cleared with 300 police officers, patrolled sections of the street for three weeks, blocked parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94."</seg>
<seg id="9">"meanwhile, the building workers were renovating the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners."</seg>
<seg id="10">"on 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court decided that the evacuation was illegal and a day later, police and construction workers withdrew from sympathizers and residents."</seg>
<seg id="11">"on this summer afternoon, the street works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk pre-Late."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the immediate vicinity of the house projects, there is a primary school and kindergartens."</seg>
<seg id="13">"leftist violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in the Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who is here three children, are mainly annoyed by the police presence."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with the residents of the house projects, they share the concern of rising rents and gentrification."</seg>
<seg id="15">"it does not sound like a Kiez, who wished for a majority of police protection against vandalizing left."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the trench, which the Berlin interior senator and the police make between house owners and their neighbours, apparently does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Friedrichshain in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional working-class neighborhood, which today, compared to the rest of the city, has a low average income and a high risk of poverty."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost all the Mainz Road close to the Rigaer."</seg>
<seg id="19">"while the Mainzer had been evacuated under a large police charge in a downright street battle, many of the projects in the Rigaer were legalized and partly inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, the city district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and ballers from all over the world in recent years: with them, residents from East-East and former home occupiers share their neighbourhood."</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also noticeable in the rents that have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are under attack as symbols for this development: they can be seen in winded panes or freshly painted facades which were thrown with paint-bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">"no other road was mentioned this year as often as" "left autonomous violence". ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"a reason for not all neighbours to view this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by the crime: crimes like body injury, according to statistics, are almost exclusively directed against policemen."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the majority of the offences make property damage, which tend to hit the newly built houses and newly renovated houses."</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a tenancy house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years, there can be no talk of uncertainty."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in terms of violence, it is important: the people in the 94 are their neighbors, they are certainly not."</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars no longer exist in the Rigaer anymore.</seg>
<seg id="29">"for the architect, her street is not a criminal focus, on the contrary:" here one helps one another, lives together on the street and gets more of each other than elsewhere. "</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is deliberately drawn into the Rigaer Straße - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">"that is why it was so important that residents get back their streets: from the police, politics and the media, which in July all suddenly claimed the direction of interpretation over the district."</seg>
<seg id="32">"but in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away from them: unsecured newbuildings in former construction gaps that drive the old inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="33">"in the end, these are condominiums that are not interesting for many here - people living here are more people who are not so well stocked," "she says."</seg>
<seg id="34">"I cannot completely approve of violence and destruction." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should you do if you never listen to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">"there is frustration on all sides, including the police and the inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for bred horses that annoy himself about color bombs: the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>

<seg id="18">The local authorities are responsible for the connection service.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must accommodate the refugees in their own or hired living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the cost of the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the local authorities."</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the administrative office to the Commune and the job center.</seg>
<seg id="22">"problem: there are free objects, but not every owner wants to offer his apartment."</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">"de facto, administration does not find private homes."</seg>
<seg id="25">"so far, it is not functional to rely on private apartments, such as Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, common apartments need to be chased as it is so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so, new containers will soon be placed in the Wasenstraße."</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">"the point of view is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in addition to a permanent residence, there are internships, apprenticeships, school grounds, one-euro jobs and employment opportunities for refugees and migrants who need to be greased or set up."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," says Regine customer. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the building yard or help house masters, do non-profit work - and that motivated and very neat, as reported by Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external action.</seg>
<seg id="34">This is "no occupational therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day needs a firm structure, say Deuschle and customer."</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so there are offers like sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">"so, here too, administration and honorary officials are jumping."</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"they must explain to the refugees that it takes time and can bridge the time wisely, for example with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"who at some point develop the feeling that he can't help anyone in Urbach, don't work and be useless, he will never integrate himself."</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority was motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"but there are also problem cases, says customer honestly," "people with whom nothing works." "the work of Deuschle and customer is always to motivate others."</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: do the two have fear of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," "Regine customer says quite clearly," "what some naive might call". ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the assassins would make them completely discredited.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "says Regine Customer."</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So main and volunteers must look for activities on site and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They are always in the background that soon a new bump of refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need an upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">"to answer this question clearly, the policy eludes itself."</seg>
<seg id="59">"actually, it is unfair to put them on site."</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach, we have not arrived where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle. "</seg>
<seg id="61">"no new refugees, that would relax the situation."</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher is already busy integrating the previous people.</seg>
<seg id="63">"these are about 100 people currently, mainly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree."</seg>
<seg id="65">"the political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers."</seg>
