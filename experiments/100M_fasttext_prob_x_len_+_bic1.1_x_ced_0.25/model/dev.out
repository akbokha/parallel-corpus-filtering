Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu isn &apos;t just friendly .
they wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
but it should also be about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution being discussed .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement and th@@ rows off Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
&quot; by the deal promoted by Obama around the Iranian nuclear program , the relationship between the two has deterior@@ ated further . &quot;
&quot; in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in front of the US Congress , which was part of an aff@@ ront against Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with reference to the election in Israel at that time . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor tries to have shot his girlfriend &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; lamb was important to stress that his &quot; sweet dog , &quot; but still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone . &quot;
&quot; inside the house the officials found the cor@@ pse of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ sh and a hand@@ written note , scri@@ b@@ bled on a white block : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted to undo it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot; this was signed by the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb . &quot;
&quot; there was no clu@@ e that Lamb , who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , already had 300 miles to the school area , where he shot and killed a popular professor of history , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office . &quot;
Delta State University Poli@@ landmark Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb made the disa@@ strous call at some point afterwards .
&quot; until the end of the day , there was another death : the Lamb took life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed it . &quot;
&quot; one day after shooting in the university , which forced students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff who knew him , were helping to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher . &quot;
students said they were happy about their lessons .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ sh died , said he had no history of violence or criminal history . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty consists of 17 members , and many students attended courses from both . &quot;
at the same time there were some tendencies to problematic behavior .
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he also seemed a bit nervous and nervous as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 he had to deal with stress . &quot;
lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said he had some health problems .
this year he taught only two online courses .
&quot; the latest changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the doc@@ torate , for which Lamb had worked so hard , would not be a guarantee for an automatic path to a position as Assistant Professor . &quot;
&quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
&quot; after the escape from the campus , the police later found a trace of Lam@@ bs when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as . &quot;
&quot; before being arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun at the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his family home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said that she believes that he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; in 2009 , Lamb began his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and pedago@@ gy . &quot;
he did a doc@@ torate in pedago@@ gy in the spring .
&quot; one of the long @-@ time friends of Lam@@ bs called him intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny . &quot;
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through common friends .
&quot; she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried some years to teach her the guitar playing . &quot;
&quot; at that time , he was the flock of women . &quot;
&quot; all the girls melted away when he was there , &quot; H@@ air@@ ston said , now 40 and in Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot;
lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ sh were obviously some time together .
&quot; in the not@@ ary Lamb , Lamb &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no evidence of a marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ sh , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but had friends and had a daughter who was now 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ St@@ een about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ St@@ een , he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ sh when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail rose three years ago on a summer fair .
later they played together the one or other gig .
O &apos;@@ St@@ een said his daughter writes and sings its own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ sh was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ tender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a dim@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he had finished lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ sh Night at night 5 September , after Lamb stopped his guitar and harmon@@ ica playing before a spar@@ se audience . &quot;
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were at the clearing and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
&quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American native and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school . &quot;
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his Brotherhood and the student committee .
&quot; on Tuesday evening about 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including teachers , staff , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ eli@@ ght commem@@ oration ceremony . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the vi@@ gil watch , while the Univers@@ itä@@ tsch@@ or &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang . &quot;
the lesson is resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; La@@ For@@ ge said . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
&quot; A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; Associ@@ ated Press author E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebe@@ cca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story was corrected in order to reflect that the police now said that Lamb had the emergency call after he shot down Schmidt , and that lamb in his distress call Pr@@ enti@@ sh as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married . &quot;
To@@ ys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for Christmas
&quot; To@@ ys R Us says that there won &apos;t be so many Christmas seasonal workers like last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says he will give the current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours . &quot;
&quot; the company said it was planning to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centres across the country . 4@@ 5.000 workers were hired during the Christmas season of 2014 . &quot;
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
&quot; the company said it will start with job interviews this month , and the number of employees is rising from October to December . &quot;
&quot; while the holidays are still a few months away , the Christmas business is getting closer , and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equi@@ p shops with employees who sell , ship and deliver products . &quot;
Michael J. Fox jo@@ king over his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre waiting for the roy@@ als , and I realize that the seat next to me is empty and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot;
the film begins and it comes to my mind that I am a simulated y@@ aw@@ n and a length of it away to be with the princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; it is really good for me , &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; the biggest time @-@ trip film ever filmed . &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected movie theaters in October . &quot;
UN boss says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; Secretary @-@ General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says that Russia &apos;s response to Russia &apos;s enhanced military support for Syria is : &quot; &quot; there is no military solution &quot; &quot; of the almost five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN leader calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution . &quot;
&quot; Mr Ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the ver@@ ge of meeting the General Assembly meeting this month in order to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
he depl@@ ored that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; make this situation dis@@ soluble . &quot;
&quot; Ban has called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in Syria , which they have demonstrated in the at@@ tainment of a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot;
8 survey values show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the top ranks at poll@@ s , it has ( yet ) not worked . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last 11 national surveys show Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nomin@@ ating the real estate car . &quot;
of course it is still too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump will probably win Repub@@ lican nomin@@ ee .
&quot; experts stress that at that time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys leadership was given to the rising Her@@ man Cain , none of whom even won a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders such as J@@ eb Bush &apos;s Super PA@@ C and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognize umps through stamina and start letting their dollars flow to t@@ opp@@ le him .
here are some current survey values indicating that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
tr@@ umps are shot by 180 degrees .
&quot; just before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candid@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University revealed that only two out of ten Repub@@ lic@@ ans viewed the property Mo@@ gu@@ l positively . &quot;
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
&quot; now , six out of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot;
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these numbers are in the early states .
&quot; last week , a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac bal@@ lot in I@@ owa found that 60 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump . &quot;
two thirds of the GO@@ P @-@ voters GO@@ P would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
&quot; in a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans said they would either be either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tr@@ ump would be nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two out of 10 say they would be &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they were &quot; thrilled &quot; vs. 40 percent say the same about Tr@@ ump ) .
the next one in excitement ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of the Repub@@ lican voters say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; angry &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , would be the candidate . &quot;
a majority of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans see Tr@@ ump Temper@@ ament not as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive remarks , 52 percent of the Irish voters ten@@ ding to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans believe that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right tem@@ per for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number applies in the first pres@@ election state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively perform his ministry and almost six of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament did not fit into the White House , ABC / Post . &quot;
repub@@ lican elec@@ tors get used to the idea .
&quot; when they set up their schol@@ ar hats , Repub@@ lican elec@@ torate dump for real . &quot;
&quot; if they are asked who most likely wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , after a pol@@ l from CN@@ N / OR@@ C from last week say four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet . &quot;
this is a change since the time four of ten at the end of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
complete disclosure : in the past GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
&quot; at this point in the last cycle , four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , a large number of GO@@ P voters have seen Tr@@ ump &apos;s campaign as plau@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; even when the re@@ public@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump is still beating almost everybody . &quot;
&quot; some experts point out that the frac@@ tured field is likely to contribute to Tr@@ ump &apos;s leadership , while anti @-@ tear support is distributed across more than a dozen other candidates . &quot;
&quot; but a survey by Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical header @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Repub@@ lican candidates , Tr@@ ump re@@ aps the majority support . &quot;
&quot; he got 13 points ahead of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally ahead of Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical header @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have formed their minds .
a new survey conducted by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half the voters who support Tr@@ ump say they have firmly forgiven their votes .
&quot; of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say never change the mind . &quot;
46 percent said they leave the door open in order to switch to other candidates .
&quot; nonetheless , the pumps are strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their mind are twice as common for Tr@@ ump . &quot;
six out of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say they agree with dump on immigration .
&quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign two months ago called immigrants from Mexico &quot; rap@@ ists , &quot; immigration and pi@@ vot@@ al point in public discourse in 2016 . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump is to keep decisive His@@ pan@@ o @-@ Americans away from the Repub@@ lican Party and damage the re @-@ orientation efforts .
&quot; but after the new ABC / Post @-@ Survey of Monday , six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say they agree with dump in questions of immigration . &quot;
&quot; so long as the immigration in the lim@@ eli@@ ght remains , Donald Tr@@ ump will apparently also do this . &quot;
the fru@@ stration of the government is climbing to new high@@ s .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son accounts for about half of the support of Repub@@ lican voters , above all due to their out@@ si@@ ders status . &quot;
&quot; six out of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say in the new Monday survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider as someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are fur@@ ious at Washington .
&quot; a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 per cent &quot; uns@@ atis@@ fied &quot; and 21 per cent &quot; pol@@ itely dis@@ grun@@ tled . &quot;
&quot; Munich , Sy@@ lt &amp; Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany &quot;
here you find the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea .
&quot; in the street , a square meter of a street roof cost 7@@ 3.@@ 300 Euros . &quot;
&quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; says the study - therefore the high price . &quot;
a new study shows in which particular layers a square meter is the most cost .
&quot; of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residential areas , however , there is a price such as pe@@ an@@ uts . &quot;
the Real Estate service provider Engel &amp; Völk@@ er has published a ranking of the most exclusive German resi@@ dences - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
&quot; there are several tens of thousands of Euros nix - per square meter , well noted . &quot;
but it &apos;s good who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top exceptionally .
champi@@ ons League : Bayern dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
double scor@@ er in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller paved the way to FC Bayern 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it went .
a sovereign kick @-@ off of the Champions League season .
world champi@@ ons Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze have created a dream start for FC Bayern in the &quot; &quot; Mission Milano &quot; &quot; Hex@@ enk@@ essel of Pi@@ ra@@ eus .
the team of Trainer P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ off match in Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in a hot atmosphere thanks to Miller &apos;s double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and i@@ dol hits ( 8@@ 9th ) ear@@ ns with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ fth success in series should be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to take the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third run . &quot;
&quot; Müller received the help of Olympic med@@ al@@ keeper Roberto , who had a f@@ lange @-@ thought shot by the World Champion at his 28 matches in the Champions League on Bayern ( Bayern ) . &quot;
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; Bayern @-@ captain Philipp Lah@@ m promised before the match at the Kar@@ ak@@ k@@ ak@@ is Stadium before 3@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich held word . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated concept without shining .
&quot; Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his latest home games in the top class , among them against well @-@ known clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) stum@@ bled here as well .
&quot; but Bavaria , defeated in seven European ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they went cour@@ age@@ ously , but in their aggressive endea@@ vors , they often came to work . &quot;
&quot; the attacks were often initiated by reloc@@ ation to lef@@ ties Douglas Costa , which rarely passed through O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i , the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i . &quot;
Müller was more lucky than his flan@@ k from the right half @-@ field in the left upper triangle .
&quot; in the 6@@ 7th minute , the World Champion awarded the possible 2 : 0 . &quot;
the best occasions in half had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
&quot; first , as Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Ide@@ a Brown hit the head ball of Poland from the line ( 26 ) . &quot;
&quot; then by direct tak@@ eover , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto was par@@ ted with his knee ( 35 . ) . &quot;
&quot; although the Bav@@ arians had raised their usual dominant play , Pi@@ ra@@ eus could make needle @-@ stit@@ ches . &quot;
but bew@@ are of Manuel Neu@@ er &apos;s keeper .
&quot; for example , when he ste@@ ered a shot of Ide@@ a over the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) . &quot;
&quot; before New , Guardi@@ ola had to defend a chain of four chains with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it well . &quot;
&quot; Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the Ka@@ der , was first sitting outside . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup hero only gave the green light after the final training , &quot; &quot; Sky says , &quot; &quot; who wants to make something different from it , this is already malign@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; also during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6. ) and made everything clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller added another . &quot;
&quot; before the game , it was at the stadium of Kra@@ w@@ allen . &quot;
&quot; after a smaller group of Bavaria fans in their audience block apparently provoked the supporters of hosts Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gestures , the security forces interven@@ ed and went against the Munich adher@@ ents . &quot;
at least one Bayern @-@ Fan was injured from the stadium .
&quot; who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth &quot;
&quot; who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - this suggests a Pots@@ dam@@ er long @-@ term study . &quot;
&quot; the good news : if there is no ren@@ unciation , the risk drops rapidly . &quot;
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
&quot; this is based on the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to qu@@ itting smoking , smokers had the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to increase the 2.5 to 3.6 fa@@ che . &quot;
&quot; the scientists had observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants . &quot;
the main causes of dental loss are tooth decay and inflammation of the gum .
&quot; for this perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors . &quot;
the relationship between smoking and loss of teeth therefore goes back to more frequent gin@@ gi@@ vi@@ tis in smokers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of tooth decay .
&quot; people who quit smoking could reduce their risk but within a short time , the researchers write in the &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it could take over ten years , however , until the threat again fell to the level of non @-@ smokers , &quot; explained author Thomas Dietrich of Birmingham University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; one must persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smokers , &quot; said director H@@ einer Boeing of DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the lifetime . &quot;
&quot; not smoking is good for lungs and vessels , and according to our findings also leads to good dental health up to high age . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 are affected by lack of lack of denti@@ stry , divided the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early dental loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ scores the findings .
arch@@ e@@ ologists reach Cologne @-@ based Rhein@@ u@@ fer on rem@@ nants from the late anti@@ quity
&quot; for the ump@@ teenth time , archaeological finds have been found on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne . &quot;
&quot; near the construction site for the new Rhine Boulevard , arch@@ e@@ ologists from the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ Museum have dug up skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday . &quot;
historians have been searching for so @-@ called soil monuments since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine .
&quot; in all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always referred to as the department of archae@@ ology for soil conservation . &quot;
&quot; in the third construction phase of the bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists were now able to find what they were looking for . &quot;
&quot; text documents have already been known that at the place in the 4th century , a fortress and in the 8th century stood a church , Trier studied . &quot;
&quot; in addition to remain@@ ders of the fortress and the church tower , a cemetery with approximately 350 graves was discovered , which probably belonged to the church . &quot;
young woman caught by freight train
&quot; after a young woman at the station is unhappy at the railway station , the Federal Police is asking the people to help . &quot;
&quot; on the early Wednesday morning around 1.@@ 40 clock , the woman crossed the railway station at the end of the train station and was captured by a freight train that came from Mön@@ chen@@ glad@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; due to the acquisition of the train , the Bundes@@ poli@@ zei ( Bundes@@ poli@@ zei ( Federal Police ) carried the most serious injuries . &quot;
she was given emergency medical treatment and brought to a hospital by ambul@@ ance personnel .

EU Commission hits new court in dispute over TTIP
&quot; in order to enhance the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement TTIP , the European Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot;
&quot; the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its function corresponds to significantly more traditional courts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; said Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström in charge of the presentation . &quot;
the Swe@@ de proposed applying the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
TTIP is said to be the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
the plans to reform the current arbit@@ ration process specifically envis@@ age that the EU states and the US jointly choose independent judges for a new investment court .
&quot; they should come from the EU , the US and third countries . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , a second instance is planned . &quot;
she would allow it to appeal against judgement .
&quot; until now , the parties involved agreed with each other to be arbitr@@ ators ; there was no objection to their verdict . &quot;
&quot; in the discussion of recent months , it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old IS@@ DS system in terms of fair@@ ness and fair@@ ness , comm@@ enting Malm@@ ström . &quot;
&quot; in the long term , she intends to work towards an International Investment Court . &quot;
&quot; there could , for example , settle disputes between Chinese companies and EU states . &quot;
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) required above all by major corporations are regarded as one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP .
&quot; the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel judi@@ ci@@ ary , on which companies can tax damages to tax pa@@ yers , lev@@ y national laws or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organisations such as Camp@@ act have in@@ adequately responded to the proposals made by the European Commission . &quot;
&quot; it was critic@@ ised , above all , that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) . &quot;
&quot; the German economic secretary , Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a great advance . &quot;
&quot; in the spring , the Commission took note of essential points drawn up by Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , in the spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European business association Business@@ Europe warned against limiting the economic opportunities of the economy by too many new rules .
especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged by this .
&quot; on Wednesday , the negotiations on the TTIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) agreement could be concluded . &quot;
the negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
&quot; however , the topic of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the US . &quot;
&quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should already stand at the end of this year . &quot;
this date is considered to be no longer ten@@ able .
delicate folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
&quot; eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) . &quot;
&quot; next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , which the timi@@ d looking folk singer recorded the picturesque US state Mich@@ ig@@ an with felt pen . &quot;
&quot; the whole audience , about 40 persons , is almost taken by St@@ ev@@ ens lecture . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of various places he always records on the map , what his min@@ u@@ zi@@ cal and delic@@ ately arranged songs report . &quot;
&quot; where they were born and what it looks like , in his homeland . &quot;
&quot; since then , St@@ ev@@ ens has proven to be a wonderfully creative fellow . &quot;
&quot; with 2003 released and third album Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ ig@@ an : the Great Lake State , clever@@ ly composed songs which blend harmon@@ i@@ ously very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , can be dri@@ fted at any time into the great opul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; the rum@@ our , &quot; Mich@@ ig@@ an , &quot; would be the first part of a we@@ aving series : each of the 50 US states should be followed in a row . &quot;
&quot; but already in 2004 and in the proximity to the Rhine , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; appeared and had a positive impact . &quot;
reduces St@@ ev@@ ens here .
live is enough for him guitar and ban@@ jo .
&quot; one year later , the musician , living in New York , returns to the series . &quot;
&quot; in 2005 , &quot; Il@@ lin@@ ois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ ise &quot; ) is published in 2005 . &quot;
bri@@ mming with ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is missing in no list of the influential music media .
&quot; following extremely productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then relies on &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic components . &quot;
&quot; this sixth album album is still highly orchest@@ rated , but played by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effects and rever@@ b . &quot;
&quot; the stage shows have long since gone up to the smaller clubs , featuring a colorful spectacle made of ne@@ on @-@ head@@ bands and large fluorescent stage fri@@ lls . &quot;
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring with Germany as part of a five member band .
in the glo@@ om@@ ily held Hamburg More !
&quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; which has been available since March . &quot;
&quot; although there are almost 2000 guests sitting in their chairs , the considerably more mature St@@ ev@@ ens returns to the in@@ timacy and folk . &quot;
&quot; without a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians is playing through the broad@@ ened album . &quot;
one hears from the audience : the talk is &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and one can therefore throw away the &quot; record . &quot;
&quot; St@@ ev@@ ens only beg@@ s himself for an en@@ core , plays acousti@@ cally a few older songs and finally bows down under thunder@@ ous applause . &quot;
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the Fra@@ c@@ unde of the Prime Minister
&quot; since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ gil@@ ance is anticipated with tension &quot;
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n will make his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ ir and for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to face the first of his six pre@@ determined questions shortly after lunch where his performance by the media is prob@@ able and the Labour MEPs are prob@@ able .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave them to colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns because it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C meeting on Tuesday .
&quot; meanwhile , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent during a commem@@ oration ceremony marking the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Britain Battle of Britain , has provoked criticism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and is at the heart of several stories in the newspapers . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them , attracted attention &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s spokesperson said he had &quot; &quot; stood in respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; and he recognized the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s shadow cabinet , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two news night program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of Shadow Ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s top team , and they appeal to differences in the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party supported it originally as leaders . &quot;
&quot; the BBC Robin Bran@@ t &apos;s political correspon@@ dent states that political differences are also &quot; &quot; stock@@ pil@@ ing &quot; &quot; within Labour , according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ &apos;s pronoun@@ cements on the position of the European Union and limiting profits . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n told the TU@@ C Conference that Labour is propos@@ ing changes to remove the whole idea of a limit altogether .
&quot; hours later Mr Smith , the Shadow working and pensions Minister , said that the party was &quot; &quot; very clear &quot; &quot; that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limit of £ 26@@ ,000 to £ 23@@ ,000 . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron since he is T@@ ory leader over the last decade of the Dis@@ patch Box in the Parliament .
&quot; the Labour leader , who has promised other policies , says that he has &quot; &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 ideas . &quot;
&quot; the Is@@ ling@@ ton North MP has said that the Prime Minister &apos;s questions are being exposed and that he will refrain from serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle will represent the Shadow Economic Council if he doesn &apos;t participate - for example if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
&quot; he has also put the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally speak the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ go , the spokesman of the lower house , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; P@@ unch and Ju@@ dy Theatre . &quot; but a few years later he admitted that he failed . &quot;
&quot; as it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the questionnaire was viewed as the prime bar@@ ometer of the prime minister of a leader and his leadership in the House of Com@@ mons and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that it has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and would require far @-@ reaching reforms . &quot;

Po@@ unds rise through accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
&quot; at the same time , FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the goal of SA@@ B@@ Miller . &quot;
&quot; between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the United Kingdom rose by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the previous year . &quot;
this percentage has been the quick@@ est and most experienced indicator since 2009 at the time of an increase in interest rates .
&quot; the pound climbed by more than 1 % over the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % against the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 . &quot;
&quot; the FT@@ SE 100 index topped with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 . &quot;
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after acquisition offered by Riv@@ ale AB In@@ Be@@ v .
&quot; a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring together brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot;
Bur@@ berry shares were higher after encouraging news from the competitor group for luxury goods Ri@@ chem@@ ont 0.@@ 9 % .
&quot; at the latest sales figures , Ri@@ chem@@ on@@ ts exceeded all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - again reported growth . &quot;
&quot; shares of Gl@@ en@@ core rose 5 % , after the mining giant said that he had spent $ 2.5 billion on sale as part of his debt reduction strategy . &quot;
&quot; the shares of Mon@@ di &apos;s packaging and paper group were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a 4.3 % decline after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his estim@@ ation for the company R@@ ating on &quot; sell . &quot; &quot;
&quot; J@@ D Sports increased by 3.1 % , after the accounting firm reported a pre @-@ tax profit of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year . &quot;
the head of J@@ D Sports states that higher wages je@@ op@@ ardi@@ se expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ gil@@ l says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
&quot; but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs of his company , he says . &quot;
&quot; the cost could affect the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less additional jobs . &quot;

&quot; at present , Mon@@ si@@ eur Bi@@ eber is in Berlin . &quot;
and the generation U@@ 17 is spinning .
like Wi@@ k@@ tori@@ a Ru@@ d@@ zin@@ ska .
the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton . &quot;
not bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied J@@ ustin yesterday .
among them E@@ wa and Vik@@ tori@@ a from Poland .
&quot; since 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , the Pol@@ in sits on the cold stone plates in front of the Berlin luxury hotel on Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz . &quot;

who is it@@ ching ?
the fans don &apos;t .
&quot; also , Bi@@ eber himself does not . &quot;
he looked after anyway .
&quot; he paid three million dollars for advertisement in the supermarket advertising break , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ im@@ ples company sp@@ her@@ ed many , many dollars to the Bi@@ eber @-@ account . &quot;
&quot; and with every doll which looks like he and over the counter , Bi@@ eber also collects . &quot;
when J@@ ustin Bi@@ eber is drinking a coffee you &apos;ll be amazed at the window disc .
he is said to have exploited more than 100 million .
some say the hyp@@ e is too far .
&quot; others stress that Bi@@ eber is finally in the US and the UK with his new single &quot; &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; &quot; on 1st place . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ eber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , is not interested in the many zer@@ os . &quot;
at least he does so .
mis@@ gi@@ da poster adds Lebanese to the idea of a potato @-@ twe@@ eter idea
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
&quot; both - namely in the potato @-@ twe@@ eter , which the Ol@@ denburg snack @-@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay has developed . &quot;
&quot; inspired by the verb &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay potato and meat put together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot;
&quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; Pot@@ atoes , instead of D@@ ön@@ er , &quot; which he had seen on television . &quot;
&quot; since then , a barbecue sk@@ ewer has been spinning in his shop , which is equipped with meat and potatoes . &quot;
&quot; this is multi @-@ cul@@ tur@@ alism for the stomach , &quot; &quot; says Al@@ hay . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the idea has allowed the Lebanese to register at the Patent Office in Munich . &quot;
&quot; according to the authorities , it has recently been protected as a utility model . &quot;
&quot; so , how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains , does not want to betra@@ y Al@@ hay . &quot;
&quot; only so much : &quot; it tastes even better , &quot; he finds . &quot;
&quot; also with its customers , the culinary understanding of the nations is good . &quot;
met@@ cash starts ground @-@ breaking campaign to combat Al@@ di@@ - invasion
Met@@ als tries to protect the I@@ GA branch off an Al@@ di march in South Australia and Western Australia .
wholes@@ al@@ ers Met@@ tok@@ ens launched a ground @-@ breaking campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run @-@ up to a $ 700 million Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia in early next year , Met@@ als and I@@ GA markets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via the social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show . &quot;
&quot; I@@ GA dealer and supplier jump on board , with brands like ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA stores and shop owners who sell dis@@ counted tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ tok@@ ines will publish further details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and devices performs its annual investors strategy day . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot of stake in the game , as South Australia and Western Australia add almost 30 percent of Met@@ a &apos;s I@@ GA stores and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ a &apos;s I@@ GA network in the eastern states . &quot;
&quot; purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in Western Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in the eastern states . &quot;
&quot; however analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will grab roughly five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after opening its first markets and will take away sales of all existing players , but mainly self @-@ employed retailers . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailers may lose 360 $ million turnover per year and Met@@ tok@@ ens $ 250 million by the end of 2016 . &quot;
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di opened 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA in the next year and generated sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
&quot; the loss in food and food business and in the amounts of met@@ c@@ ash@@ s of high fixed cost base could cost around 13 million $ profit before interest and taxes , said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Met@@ tok@@ ine loses market shares in the eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan reveals that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal . &quot;
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ a &apos;s revenue in food and food business by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 will fall by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
&quot; last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , said at a business dinner in Melbourne , that Met@@ tok@@ ines are likely to disappear within a decade . &quot;
cash declined to react to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments publicly .
but it is assumed that a member of the board of metal cash came in contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
&quot; i@@ G@@ AS market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ a &apos;s food and food trade , which supplies about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting operating debt reduction at the same time pressure on sales and margins . &quot;
&quot; the wholes@@ aler , however , resist@@ s and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million to increase sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths every week to improve their stores by growing faster @-@ growing fresh foods and providing a better choice of private label foods . &quot;
Met@@ a &apos;s main business leader Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and shop renovation programs are to grow to El@@ an and hopes that in 2017 the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ac@@ is is supported by the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ac@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behavior .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ac@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ z and according to the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly deserved praise rather than criticism for his own behavior .
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ab@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ os , which is always referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; got into the spotlight by the in@@ famous argument of Kyr@@ gy@@ z with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters . &quot;
&quot; in a fi@@ ery qualification match in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati , Kok@@ kin@@ ab@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , and Har@@ rison exc@@ laimed : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have had to beat Kyr@@ gy@@ z , and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cra@@ mp th@@ war@@ ted a potential US Open @-@ win by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ac@@ is was defended by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glas@@ gow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ fin@@ als against Great Britain . &quot;
&quot; one thing I am rather en@@ vious of is the fact that , in my view , Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn a little bit into the dispute , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost the US Open because of a cra@@ p , but he is not the first player to break a ra@@ cket of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on and I think he deserved a lot of recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a little too severely . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he fits into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is well in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its . &quot;
He@@ aly also supported the decision to not consider Kyr@@ gy@@ z on the important preliminary decision which begins on Friday and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for all but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term fixed component to the team .
&quot; first , we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ z &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he climbs in the eyes of the public , and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to make him understand the consequences of his action . &quot;
&quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary p@@ aves emergency , closes the border , keeps refugees back &quot;
Hungary declared the emergency and sealed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all parties trying to illeg@@ ally enter the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in a No Man land and responded with ou@@ trage to Serbian officials .
&quot; for an unknown time , the people who fled from violence were stuck in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there . &quot;
but frustr@@ ations increased .
&quot; as a police helicopter ho@@ vering over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; opened the border ! &quot; &quot; and cried out insul@@ ts against the Hungarian deployment police . &quot;
some rejected sub@@ stitu@@ tions of food and water .
&quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister stated it was &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back while more and more arriving from Macedonia and Greece . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; it is necessary to hold talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came one day after the 28 @-@ nations block at a controversial meeting in Brussels no common immigration policy could be agreed .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in the crowded Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that eventually the next month or until the end of the year , an agreement would be reached that the EU states would receive further 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; Hungary , however , did not put its hopes on a spe@@ edy action from Brussels or its neighbors . &quot;
&quot; the emergency state , which was launched on Tuesday in two southern regions , gave authorities greater powers to cope with the crisis , thus blocking roads and spe@@ eding up asylum procedures . &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants across the country - after having stopped a fence on the Serbian border .
&quot; C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates were deployed at the race , the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck and an entry point into the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insisted that most of the coming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who claim protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damaging of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high fence that the government built along the southern border to Serbia became a crime . these laws also set higher sentences for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares the emergency state , &quot; said Cab@@ inet spokesman Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porters in the southern town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it very clear : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still agree on the use of the military that is expected next week , but re@@ porters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities considered 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated deeper into the country . &quot;
&quot; they come here by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of off@@ ences according to the new laws . &quot;
authorities are trying to repair the fence quickly .
Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning also two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia after a train carriage with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders was arrived .
&quot; chaos surrounding the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container in order to process the data of people and squee@@ ze a crowd to intervene there . &quot;
&quot; about 20 managed to arrive , but thousands remained outside . &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the main motorway link between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national pol@@ l
&quot; former Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton is still holding a double @-@ digit advance in the democratic race for nomin@@ ating at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins over against the ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the prim@@ aries ( 58 percent earlier ) , while S@@ anders is second in second place , with 27 percent ( increase of 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; vice @-@ president Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is running for the presi@@ dency , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic constitu@@ ents of the prim@@ aries . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the start of the prim@@ aries , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion determines which candidate they will support . &quot;
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their election than those of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders achieved some gains . &quot;
&quot; Clinton holds a large margin in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have declined . &quot;
&quot; their support for the men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders is here only with 5 points . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s advantage over 50 years of democratic voters has evapor@@ ated , and they and s@@ anders are now at the same level . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , however , still has a big advantage over the older voters . &quot;
&quot; in the past month , Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with a two @-@ digit advance in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now a 5 @-@ point advance in this group . &quot;
about half of the democratic vot@@ er elections nationwide say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm when nominated by the party .
&quot; a quarter would support them with some reservations , and another 15 percent would only support them because it is the candidate . &quot;
six percent would not support them .
perhaps it is not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are enthusiastic about her .
the views are more mixed in those who currently do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusi@@ astically support them .
&quot; while 48 percent of the Democratic voters of the prim@@ aries say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Repub@@ lican voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; when Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it &apos;s time for a woman to become president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s supporters have also mentioned their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
permission to deal with the problems and the di@@ vis@@ ability are also quoted .
&quot; as the vice president th@@ rows a potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of the democratic vot@@ er of the pre @-@ elections want to see him in the race - though a third believes he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; when democratic elec@@ tors of the prim@@ aries are asked who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the head . &quot;
from Clinton &apos;s followers more than half say that bi@@ ds would be their second choice far from S@@ anders .
&quot; if Bi@@ den decides not to run for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s advantage is against S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in race to 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; fifty percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as candidate with the best chances of winning the election , but this figure has fallen from 78 percent last month . &quot;
&quot; bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in the question of what is more important with a candidate , demo@@ cra@@ cies call questions about elec@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; similarly as in the last month , not a single democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out as unacceptable to these elec@@ tors of the prim@@ aries . &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results in some important characteristics among voters in the prim@@ aries of their party .
&quot; plus , Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den are considered to be honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is best cut off with hon@@ esty , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the leader . &quot;
&quot; thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not think of him . &quot;
&quot; in general , democratic elec@@ tors of the prim@@ aries also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; in all these measurements , about a quarter of democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server are still being asked as Secretary of State , most Democratic voters of the prim@@ aries are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions overall . &quot;
but it is a different story in the American public as a whole .
&quot; half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their statement , while only about one third is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the email controversy had no effect on Clinton &apos;s general opinion , although 36 percent said that her opinion had deterior@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; there are mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six out of 10 who say their views have become worse by Clinton . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is considered honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of their party , this continues to be a problem for them under registered voters : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 percent of the voters do not consider it an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
&quot; at the same time , 55 percent of voters see Tr@@ ump as un@@ honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy nationwide . &quot;
&quot; Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , receive good grades in leadership . &quot;
&quot; of the six candidates who were tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush would best cut off with hon@@ esty . &quot;
&quot; a majority regards S@@ anders as honest , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him . &quot;
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 demo@@ cra@@ cies in the prim@@ aries is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son shifts close to Donald Tr@@ ump in nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is close behind Donald Tr@@ ump in the latest survey by C@@ BS News / New York Times
&quot; in the meantime , half of the voters &apos; support in the new pol@@ l accounts for the two candidates and others lose dramatically . &quot;
&quot; Repub@@ lican voters continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers nationwide . support grows by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted prior to Fox News Deb@@ ate last month , 27 % in the survey on Tuesday . &quot;
but Car@@ son fell from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son was well received by demographic groups and sur@@ passed Tr@@ ump among repub@@ lican elec@@ tors with higher education .
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is defeated with Wis@@ cons@@ ins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who is at the deepest level , with 10 % support last month to now 2 % . &quot;
&quot; former Gover@@ nor of Florida J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are 6 % in third place . &quot;
the margin of error in the sample of 3@@ 76 persons of Repub@@ lican elec@@ tors in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week , shows that Car@@ son is growing in the poll@@ s - he lands with 19 % support among the re@@ public@@ ans , behind the pump with 32 % support . &quot;
the recent survey conducted by ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump well ahead of Car@@ son .
&quot; looking at a Car@@ son rising in the last week , Tr@@ ump found some si@@ eves for the neuro@@ surgeon himself , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to ask Tr@@ ump faith . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump on Saturday during a campaign show in I@@ owa . &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently warm up to 29 degrees .
&quot; even if peak values are measured only in the distance , for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers , a trip to the Mediterranean is sufficient to find even warm water . &quot;
a bath in the north or the Baltic Sea may be a rather short pleasure with a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; some people don &apos;t go to the sea any more : the water in the North Sea and Baltic Sea has a maximum of 18 degrees this week , divi@@ des the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east it can even reach up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic Sea it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt is 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Bar@@ uch College newcom@@ er
&quot; almost two years after a student died during a bul@@ ky ritual of a student association in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges are filed against five persons . &quot;
&quot; members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood attacked Cha@@ un &quot; &quot; Michael &quot; &quot; Den@@ g during an initiation ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , condemned the police . &quot;
&quot; officials said he was loaded with blin@@ d@@ folded eyes with a 30 pound ru@@ cksack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a destination . &quot;
Mr. Den@@ g eventually compla@@ ined about headaches and he fell unconscious .
members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g became im@@ potent and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital such as the police .
&quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , goo@@ geln &apos;s symptoms and Andy Men@@ g , to contact the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice , police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members began to hide the tools and set the common interests of the Brotherhood via that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; Poli@@ sig@@ ef Wagner said . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and the next morning he died of his injuries . &quot;
&quot; after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly added to his head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs with bl@@ unt force . &quot;
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ anes of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies every year since 1970 , said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer who represents the D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and its members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended an indictment for the murder of the first five members .
&quot; thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with serious attacks and formation of a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to be responsible for the persons involved , but if there is an organisation which - officially or in@@ officially - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also be held ac@@ coun@@ table , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the Brotherhood has rev@@ oked their affili@@ ation with the local group . &quot;
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; interest rate comes , and the house se is falling , returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession . &quot;
we know this .
what we do not know is how long it will take and how long it will last .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy provides only a small guide to the process . &quot;
a recession came in only 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted for 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , although not always , a factor in the way the economy and the financial systems react . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank strongly emphasized that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather to the period required for normal@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; in the end , however , market participants might find that all the excitement might be exagger@@ ated because of an interest rate increase . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of cheap money , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to the sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean , however , that there will be no effect . &quot;
&quot; here is a view , based on historical trends , how some areas of the economy could react : &quot;
&quot; as the market has seen in the last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest rate increases can be volatile for a while . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the impact is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there is apparently a tendency for fortune income to be di@@ gest@@ ed 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said German @-@ Bank analysts in a more recent study on what happened after F@@ ed interest rate increases . &quot;
&quot; more precisely , the market has been in the past 35 years mostly in the upward trend - roughly 14 percent - on the road to interest rate , then return to normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , according to a current analysis , which published Bob D@@ oll , Head of Plant Strate@@ gic at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; the Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares ten@@ denti@@ ally occur later in the revenue cycle , and the return on loans commen@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often support them . &quot;
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that did not exist before and could accelerate a recession . &quot;
what is most remarkable is that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point in the interest rate of the F@@ ed .
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , nominal GDP has only twice the nominal GDP of 4.5 percent since 1950 . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; raising the rate of interest in such fragile economic cou@@ l@@ isse might be ris@@ ky and raises the question , &quot; &quot; whether this time is different , &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; market participants focused all year on the interest rate of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were posted to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC may approve an increase in this meeting , fut@@ ures trading is only a probability of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all enhancing cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and before rec@@ essions have been put in the shadows very quickly after the start of recovery , &quot; &quot; said the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest ever the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession , the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months so far . &quot;
&quot; the firm income was also volatile , as the market anticip@@ ates interest rates and the pattern is quite similar to that of the capital market . &quot;
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than in shares when they change their strategic course .
&quot; in bonds , returns seem to change direction as soon as the initial up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment / lowering occurs in the cycle . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the enhancement cycle , the loans drop immediately , said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will result in yields between longer and shorter loans closer together , leading to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve . &quot;
&quot; high interest bonds often result in better earnings in such a climate , although &quot; we are still cau@@ tious to expect higher income , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , fixed @-@ income analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis . &quot;
Jones believes the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , credit tigh@@ tening has increased and volati@@ lity has risen - all the characteristics of the market if the F@@ ed sharpen@@ ed its strategy . &quot;
&quot; large and large companies operating in the United States will benefit from this , when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; multinational companies with high debt are getting worse , as an increasing dollar is making their products more expensive on the global market and also the financing of their debt . &quot;
&quot; the story shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares tend to be extremely positive for three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot;
&quot; companies with a strong balance sheet have exceeded by 5 percentage points on average after each of the tax increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 . &quot;
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their low @-@ quality counter@@ parts by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts are a big problem .
&quot; companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose the most , Gold@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; outside the pure share games , consumers will also benefit from the rise in dollars . &quot;
&quot; savers are able to see profits through higher earnings , even if experts of different opinions are how fast this will take place . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says member of parliament Andrew B@@ ingham &quot;
&quot; the Conserv@@ ative Member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the channel for its &quot; &quot; stup@@ idity &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distinguished from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins took the programme The Voice and said this was not very original .
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns into &quot; Classic FM , &quot; says a leading member of parliament , and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he is doing something that the private channels do not do . &quot;
&quot; the Conserv@@ ative MP Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ boss , that the public broad@@ caster &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer distinguish from its commercial competitors . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; dum@@ b &quot; - but it seems to transform into Classic FM , &quot; he said . &quot;
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards launched last year seem to be just under a different name .
&quot; so if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples where you can only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said . &quot;
BBC General Director dismissed the accus@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far from his commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public education .
&quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , I will not learn anything else about classical music anywhere else . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and playing music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and commissioned new works is really important , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that it is necessary to work harder to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British were less informed about classical music . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing in the committee for the selection of culture , media and sports came under fire to kick off the commercial ri@@ vals . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ ory de@@ pu@@ ties Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked The Voice , the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , purchased by Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated £ 22 million . &quot;
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and is not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall was insi@@ sting that BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George was produced as a judge - &quot; in a special BBC way . &quot;
&quot; he added that he would like the company &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; when there is a series of entertainment next time . &quot;
&quot; however , he refused to exclude the order from further series of The Voice in the future , or to issue money from the fee owners for other entertainment formats . &quot;
Internet sales increased slow@@ est in August and Black Friday may be responsible for this
&quot; in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales . &quot;
&quot; last month , there was the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000 . &quot;
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that Black Friday has slow@@ ed down the issues in November
&quot; for over a decade , the virtual shopping has bo@@ omed , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns . &quot;
experts say there are signs that online sales are stagn@@ ating after new figures show only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the start of record in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always developed over time , &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index to the Guardian . &quot;
&quot; he explained that online sales increased three years ago , when buyers started making purchases with their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now that is comm@@ uting , and we may experience that growth is dimin@@ ishing . &quot;
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the decreasing turnover .
&quot; experts believe that buyers will hold back their purchases prior to this event , which will take place last Friday in November . &quot;
&quot; last year , five times the average number of buyers came to their computers to make their bar@@ gains and some dealer websites fell off . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , where the buyers fought for bar@@ gains could stop shop@@ pers from making purchases . &quot;
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that £ 5 output was spent over £ 1 million online .
&quot; in some products , such as TVs and washing machines , more than one @-@ third of the purchases are now carried out via web shops . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothing and shoes online instead of the fashion neckl@@ aces in the inner cities . &quot;
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca near the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 dead are supported by Muslims at the first funeral in Mec@@ ca through the streets .
Saudi Arabia reduces the collapse in part of the huge Saudi Ben Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
&quot; hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the dead , who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed in Mec@@ ca &apos;s big mos@@ que . &quot;
&quot; mour@@ ners filled , largely dressed in white , the track to declare their respect when the first of the dead came their last journey to the Al @-@ Renaissance cemetery . &quot;
&quot; the funeral procession passed by the Holy Place , where only days before , a building crane collap@@ sed through the mos@@ que &apos;s ceiling and then fell on the worshi@@ ppers . &quot;
&quot; the bodies were released for the funeral , when the Saudi king imposed a san@@ ction on Bin Laden &apos;s family property because of the disaster , which left 3@@ 94 wounded . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 people killed when a crane collap@@ sed through the Great Central Mo@@ sch@@ ee Mec@@ ca , were carried through the streets . &quot;
&quot; among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane was under@@ lining . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ ess in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already stated that the H@@ add@@ les will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands who continue to come to the city .
&quot; today King Sal@@ man said , the Bin Laden Group would not have allowed the arm of the crane to stand when he was not used . &quot;
&quot; an Arabic version of the decree issued by the state of Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden Group is responsible for the collapse . &quot;
&quot; the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company abroad is prohibited . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man began to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which crashed into an inner court of the Great Mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ ess who later took place this month . &quot;
&quot; the Bin Laden Group has not issued any statements about the collapse of the Cran@@ s , and their representatives were not available for comment . &quot;
the Royal Dec@@ ree also ad@@ joined the group because of non @-@ current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surrounded Mec@@ ca &apos;s large mo@@ cha as part of the massive construction project led by the Bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden family has been associated with the family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over major construction projects .
&quot; the de@@ ceased leader of Al Qaeda , O@@ sam@@ a bin Laden , was a rebel@@ li@@ ous son , ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in 1990 @-@ s . &quot;
&quot; the collapse of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims . &quot;
officials said that 158 people stay in hospital .
government officials ordered that 1 million ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4.000 ) be paid to the relatives of the killed and the same sum of permanently injured .
other injuries receive half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
&quot; British increasingly employ cra@@ ft@@ spe@@ ople , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry &quot;
the number of skilled tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe has stepped up
&quot; this results in 200 additional Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , aimed at cra@@ ft@@ spe@@ ople . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , King@@ f@@ isher will close 60 B &amp; Q outlets throughout the country &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , Chief Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the Daily Mail &quot;
&quot; it is alleged that British are laying down their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the deployment of qualified Eastern European handic@@ ra@@ fts@@ men , who perform their work in their homes . &quot;
&quot; if you are skill@@ fully dealing with a hammer or a brush for painting walls , you seem to belong to a minority today . &quot;
&quot; the British increasingly employ cra@@ ft@@ spe@@ ople to carry out DIY jobs in their homes , such as the boss of the company behind B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , a new managing director of King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the construction markets chain , said that a large increase in the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe , offering services at low prices , is now obsol@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; this is why King@@ f@@ isher plans to open 200 further Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which turn to professional tra@@ des@@ people and close 60 sales points of B &amp; Q . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops because eight out of ten buying decisions in store are made by women .
&quot; at the moment , men out@@ weigh the men . &quot;
she said it was necessary to face growing demographic trends that show more female single households who do more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
we have to push this stronger towards a balance .
&quot; in principle , half of our customers consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions regarding the purchase of articles by women . &quot;
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry who is one of only five women at the top of a UK listed in FT@@ SE@@ 100 index has also re@@ structured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions .
&quot; King@@ f@@ isher is almost the only company that has exactly 50 percent of the team occupied with women , including its Executive Board and Chief Financial Officer . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ f@@ isher reported a decline in the half @-@ year profit and sales after the Group owed the cost of closing the stores .
&quot; as a result of the trend , King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q will open 200 new stores . &quot;
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ ob on account of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
&quot; on Wednesday , two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball player A@@ ich / D@@ ob were responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and sever@@ ance of duties on Wednesday at the K@@ lagen@@ furt state court . &quot;
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also charged with abuse .
he has been legally acqu@@ itted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current process was postpon@@ ed .
&quot; according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , the investigation revealed that in 2006 @-@ 2011 the defend@@ ants used money from the association accounts that they were allowed to disp@@ ose in their functions for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; he gra@@ bs the damage with around 400@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the sports officials are also charged with financial off@@ ences .
&quot; this fact was the chair of the Sch@@ öff@@ el@@ sen@@ ate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it should be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; to dis@@ miss the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence argued that at no time an asset had been created for the association . &quot;
&quot; the sports officials would only have charged expenses and the sports club for which they had been working from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they invested a lot of time and money , the liabilities amounted to some 600@@ ,000 sh@@ ill@@ ings ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; at that time , we faced the situation : do we continue or ban the club ? &quot; &quot; one of the defend@@ ants , in the bread@@ board of the finance ministry , told one of the defend@@ ants . &quot;
with his colleague and co @-@ defend@@ ant he decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; we have advanced money , laid down our life insurance for safety at the bank , &quot; he said during the arrest . &quot;
&quot; the association has been agreed with : you can manage the money freely , no debt can be made . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in the case of a corresponding financial success , the compensation of the expense allowance had been decided retro@@ spec@@ tively until 1991 . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one part of the expense allowance was paid only years later , namely from 2003 onwards , as a plus in the account . &quot;
&quot; this is why l@@ ump sum and not detail illustrations also appeared , the ex @-@ chairman explained the events . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and savings accounts managed the two defend@@ ants together , said the second accused . &quot;
&quot; why the pay@@ outs of the association were not disclosed in detail , the judge asked . &quot;
&quot; the association was not interested in the details of the financial services , but it was important to have only the freedom of debt , the answer . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account . &quot;
&quot; that would have been set@@ backs , said the accused . &quot;
&quot; this securities account ran on the name of the second defend@@ ant , and , according to his statement , was not known to the association . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot;
the respon@@ dent did not know the answer for a long time .
then he finally thought he had believed that this was the best thing for the club .
&quot; if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor put it in the room . &quot;
&quot; the co @-@ defend@@ ant had been informed , the function@@ ary justified himself . &quot;
this rebu@@ ke was formulated as &quot; damage repar@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; why in@@ dem@@ n@@ ity ? , judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know . &quot;
&quot; the first defend@@ ant stated that he did not agree with this formulation , because the association did not have any damage . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do when the lawyer tells us , &quot; You are all from the tailor . &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the function@@ ary , he never covered a cent salary , he counted only mil@@ eage and di@@ eting . &quot;
&quot; he charged the association 1.000 euros per month for diets , but the actual effort was much higher , he added . &quot;
exact documents for the early years could not show the defend@@ ants .
&quot; they declared that these were not stored properly after an operational inspection , in which everything was judged as correct . &quot;
mil@@ eage was also related to the second defend@@ ant .
&quot; all the de@@ port@@ ations were made in cash , for that he had to go to Blei@@ burg from his home town to lead the Bank to Blei@@ burg , he stated in his statement . &quot;
the main hearing will be continued on 23 September with the interro@@ gation of witnesses .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard designs further 30.000 jobs
&quot; in addition to the workforce reduction that has been ongoing for three years , the Computer@@ terri@@ fic will reduce further jobs when spl@@ itting the company . &quot;
the sub@@ missions at the US @-@ Computer@@ terri@@ esen H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) don &apos;t end .
&quot; as part of its restructuring , the US technology company plans to reduce the amount of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer segment . &quot;
&quot; as a result , costs in the amount of $ 2.@@ 7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) are to be saved , the company announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the step will lead to a special charge of around USD 2.@@ 7 billion , which will inc@@ ur from the fourth quarter . &quot;
&quot; the mining of 55@@ ,000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 , HP still employed some 30@@ 2,000 associates . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard shares amounted to 2.3 percent . &quot;
&quot; the corporation , which has become large @-@ sized by printers in Pal@@ o Alto , is currently spl@@ itting up : the computer and printer business is to be bund@@ led again in a new company - separate from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services . &quot;
both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange .
a further dis@@ appo@@ inting PC sales as well as a weaker demand from corporate customers after his services set the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo .
&quot; in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , sales of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent . &quot;
sales fell by 8 percent to just under EUR 25.@@ 4 billion .
sales declined in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP responds with spl@@ itting and solid positions on the changes in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has responded very late to customers increasingly buying smartphones and tablets than traditional computers and getting more and more business done online .
&quot; in total , Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans envis@@ age the reduction of around 55@@ ,000 jobs . &quot;
conflict : majority supports anti @-@ IS training mission
&quot; however , a direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would be rejected mainly by rejection : 54 percent said against it , 35 percent agreed . &quot;
the fact that other states fly air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria is 61 percent positive .
&quot; on the other hand , 24 percent are to intervene in the conflict . &quot;
&quot; a co @-@ operation with the Syrian authorities , Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , decl@@ ines 51 per cent of the respon@@ dents , 20 percent would be there . &quot;
29 per cent were not able to decide .
car : second day of the day at 6@@ 6th IA@@ A
&quot; the focus of the fair is on the 27 September networked , self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicles as well as electro@@ mobility . &quot;
&quot; after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show under the motto &quot; mobility . &quot; &quot;
the wide public can visit the IA@@ A from Saturday .
&quot; as two years ago , the organisers of the V@@ DA car association expect some 900@@ ,000 visitors . &quot;
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : non@@ violence in Serbian @-@ Hungarian fron@@ tier
&quot; on the Serbian border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , the Hungarian police used tear gas and floo@@ d@@ lights against several hundred refugees . &quot;
the Euron@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the departure of violence at the border control point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
&quot; behind the police , a police line had formed and behind the polic@@ emen a water @-@ light was ready . &quot;
&quot; 40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials . &quot;
the officials first inv@@ aded the pepper spray .
&quot; after that , the police used tear gas . &quot;
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
&quot; in doing so , the group was dissolved . &quot;
the refugees have now retired a little .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone .
&quot; children , who had breath@@ ed the tear gas , cried out . &quot;
other refugees sl@@ umped together and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the Serbian police press spokes@@ men also suffered injuries due to the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time to decide on interest rates for the US central bank
&quot; the world is watching when the US central bank is coming together on two days , Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade , interest has been raised or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey among 80 econom@@ ists asked by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half , which was still last week in view that the F@@ ed will do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will pers@@ ist a little longer and keep interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent . &quot;
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest put on zero .
&quot; for the first time we are approaching a situation in which a large central bank may possibly leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , senior employee at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the US economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ros@@ y outlook on global conditions . &quot;
&quot; it warned the markets of sett@@ ling on an increase , but the signs indicate that the chances of such a step are good . &quot;
the decision is scheduled to be announced at 8 : 00 CE@@ T on Thursday
death cap at Delta State University leaves ap@@ ologies for cancell@@ ations
&quot; after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , Monday morning - and before he shot his colleagues on the day and killed - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; in the first murder and wanted &quot; &quot; he could undo it , &quot; &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that lamb , lecturer for ge@@ ography and social science education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning &quot;
&quot; and he said that he had shot on someone , and someone killed . &quot;
lamb declared to the staff of the emergency staff that the police must send police officers to his home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; is in the house , but that &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; , &quot; but probably be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the call@@ ers for his name , but he did not give him . &quot;
lamb had no explanation for his shots .
&quot; when police entered the scene they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ sh , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , who said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted to , I could undo it . &quot;
&quot; I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
&quot; after writing the note , Lamb drove 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen converted him . &quot;
&quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lamb allegedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ sh also had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there is no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ sh was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , who said she had been married for about seven years , as a &quot; good man . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but they remained friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ St@@ een said he and Pr@@ enti@@ sh had a daughter , 19 is , and she was &quot; destroyed &quot; on the ground . &quot;
he said Pr@@ enti@@ sh was her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ sh worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ sh , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , met Lamb for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; Know@@ les said . &quot;
&quot; the police said that Lamb called relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; He is not going to prison . &quot;
&quot; when polic@@ emen caught him on Highway # 1 near green@@ ville later at that night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled by foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot . &quot;
&quot; in the spring of 2015 , Lamb was granted a doc@@ torate degree from the Delta State University , such as his CV on the University &apos;s website . &quot;
stars who have lost their lucky charm
&quot; the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years . &quot;
&quot; in 2001 he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , for cancer . &quot;
&quot; the actor allegedly has to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug possession . &quot;
all this certainly demands its toll .
Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa is expanding the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large group conversion .
&quot; with a better organisation , the Lufthansa Group aims to save half a billion euros a year . &quot;
&quot; 150 of the approximately 1,000 executives around the world will cost the workplace . &quot;
&quot; with the pilot trade union , however , there are new negotiations . &quot;
Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and upgrading the cheap ey@@ ec@@ alls Eu@@ row@@ ings .
&quot; the aim of the re@@ orientation is a contribution to earnings of some 500 million euros a year from cost and earnings syner@@ gies , the airline announced on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; among other things , Lufthansa will be no longer a board member for the passenger business in the future . &quot;
the low @-@ cost airline Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independent as possible .
&quot; in the future , CEO Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r will be responsible for the management of Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt for Eu@@ row@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; with the new creation , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future . &quot;
&quot; up to now , the organization of the 120 000 staff was complex . &quot;
&quot; the airlines operate under the roof of the Passage Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros . &quot;
new negotiations with the pilots
&quot; in the conflict with the pilot adjustment cockpit ( VC ) , negotiations are to be resum@@ ed after the legal strike on this Thursday . &quot;
that divided the union .
the theme of the talks is to be the reti@@ ring regime for pilots .
&quot; &quot; in one year , the cockpit wants to achieve results as quickly as possible with a predicted record result . &quot; &quot;
the conflict between union and airline led to several strikes in recent months .
&quot; in addition to the transitional provision of the pilots , the background is the &quot; Wings &quot; savings concept . &quot;
&quot; in the fight against competitors , Lufthansa will out@@ source distances to the Group &apos;s own low @-@ cost airline Eu@@ row@@ ings . &quot;

hat@@ ch Sha@@ w from Manchester United won &apos;t play for months because of double frac@@ ture
&quot; in the Champions League defeat of Manchester , Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven . &quot;
&quot; while this caused the left foreign def@@ enders to cry and exclude him for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not give up the hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a ruth@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w broke into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before being brought to the hospital .
&quot; said van Ga@@ al : &quot; &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and is located in the hospital . &quot;
he will be transferred tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operate in Manchester .
&quot; it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 , it &apos;s very hard and then plays fant@@ astically , and then that happens . &quot;
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
&quot; I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , it will take six months and it will not play during the group phase . &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the im@@ position of an El@@ f@@ meter .
&quot; Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not punish the Mex@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian arbitr@@ ator had er@@ red .
you can judge for yourself when I say an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; a tweet to Sha@@ ws &apos;s account was : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my path to recovery starts now , I come back more strongly . &quot;
related : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w during the defeat at PS@@ V
&quot; with the European Championship in France , the UK distributor has an additional incentive to recover until the next June . &quot;
&quot; Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
&quot; when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , all are very sad about it . &quot;
it &apos;s never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ p Holland Team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you then hear that it is a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; Co@@ c@@ u said . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball rolling in another direction , so it looked like he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard this can be . &quot;
I feel very badly about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to the hospital - after a b@@ oul@@ der of Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t be long before you know it by heart . &quot;
unless you are David Cameron .
&quot; when he was asked by a provider of child care systems to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , the en@@ vi@@ ro@@ ment of Dr. Se@@ uss , published in 1971 . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , writes Mr Cameron in a message on Super@@ Camp@@ s website , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , because it seems to be a picture or a message we &apos;ve missed so far . &quot;
&quot; everything nice and good , except for the following paragraph , in which Cameron re@@ port@@ edly describes the plot of the book , instead giving a content of the 2012 movie version , adding new characters and details , in order to expand the rather short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where all nature went and even the air is a commodity , a boy called T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; as if it were not yet suspi@@ cious enough : the text presented by Cameron is partly read as the summary of the Lor@@ ax film presented on the website of Internet Movie Database , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy called T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he ad@@ mits to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so familiar with the plot of the book . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row in a row . &quot;
a D@@ ow@@ ning Street spokes@@ woman said the text probably came from Cameron &apos;s electoral district .
&quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Mr Cameron &apos;s staff , but no further comments were submitted . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the expul@@ sion of England &apos;s crew , but it is still difficult &quot;
&quot; encounter@@ ing Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when you see the cad@@ re chosen for the tour in England , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card . &quot;
I would not exclude a down@@ side victory .
&quot; A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks site might be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they won &apos;t wear s@@ cars of 2012 , only a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball Mo@@ een Ali developed as Sp@@ in @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ le Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown great@@ ness at test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
this news : Adam Ly@@ th leaves the UK test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
&quot; the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , difficult for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire . &quot;
&quot; in his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket@@ eers are oriented to results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this before - players are their own best selection . &quot;
&quot; long ago , one would have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own fate . &quot;
&quot; hopefully when he kno@@ cks out further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there &apos;s another chance . &quot;
&quot; the England coach Tre@@ vor Ba@@ yl@@ iss praised his attitude even if he didn &apos;t get such good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man . &quot;
the question of how much time a test drummer gets to set his mark is difficult .
&quot; Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him , while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine . &quot;
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and forward .
&quot; the only accus@@ ation that can be raised was that England initially deployed Jonathan Des@@ p@@ ite in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form , but this lost opportunity is now in the past . &quot;
&quot; Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he &apos;s a drummer I reck@@ on highly . &quot;
&quot; he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw near Yor@@ k@@ shire in early this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge Square , which met us very well . &quot;
&quot; he must have at least the same odds as those before him , but this depends , of course , on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to cook Mo@@ een next Cook , which would provide an extra spin bow@@ ler and got four Qui@@ cks , appeared and I have nothing against it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ h@@ ander has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious player of cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; Mo@@ een might not get his job done for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for her , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my former te@@ amm@@ ate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he joined the op@@ ener in 2001 .
he immediately made three hundred R@@ uns and didn &apos;t look back .
&quot; Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the ca@@ der as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited handling he has impressed me very much as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may see their statistics - average 31 with the ra@@ cket and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a punch , but there is no large number of backup sp@@ inners that raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England has made some clever additions to the training staff . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ k , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game , who will bring a wealth of experiences as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and a powerful deployment into the setup .
&quot; I always felt he was created for international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh air in the locker room , even if the messages are in line with what has been said before . &quot;
&quot; Coll@@ i &apos;s te@@ amm@@ ate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the one @-@ da@@ yers , R@@ oot got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part . &quot;
&quot; some won &apos;t agree , but coaches and team players do not determine the schedule . &quot;
and you must remember that as with players their jobs depend on results .
such decisions are not made light hearted .
the Bre@@ x@@ it bearing ( Bre@@ x@@ it = Britain &apos;s exit from the EU ) could gain tri@@ but@@ aries if the economy is sl@@ ack@@ ening until 2017
&quot; David Cameron &apos;s un@@ fer@@ mented ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU will go deeper with each day , even without the election of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n became the Leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , who fought severely on Tuesday for Europe . &quot;
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ at friend recently said that some member states are so deeply involved in various crises , as the EU is now and not always out of its own guilt , Britain itself created agenda with split concessions and disrup@@ tive treaty changes that they usually do not want . &quot;
&quot; in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it would not like it if they end@@ anger social protection . &quot;
we could also call it Dave and George Sel@@ f@@ ie &apos;s agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and Finance Minister climbed to summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say they win allies for reforms . &quot;
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; my European friend , looking for outside looking UK inside the EU tent - &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets you see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials came to the point where they don &apos;t care whether we stay or go . &quot;
&quot; Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as has happened in the over @-@ over @-@ long endurance races like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
French Fran@@ co@@ is Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
it is also a f@@ ading force .
&quot; Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a lef@@ tist . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to imagine that they will break a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot;
&quot; therefore , some such ministers may even deliberately not intend to deliberately comment , completely in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my friend susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a loan &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Britain did not win anything from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
Europeans know how predat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and what EU scep@@ tics the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press @-@ ar@@ one is as they did during the referendum inspired by Tony Ben@@ n in 1975 that supported our entry 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; they can weak@@ en Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ euro opport@@ uni@@ sts who made himself a name as an &quot; EU straight ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; with all his ma@@ dness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were . &quot;
&quot; to this end , the Med@@ ley belonged to tax @-@ fear@@ ing villa@@ ins , telephone @-@ hack@@ ed foreigners and the pseu@@ do non @-@ natives , who own most of our large newspapers . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her , but realized that when you sit in a cage with a hot gor@@ illa , you better distribute ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of going to his lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir himself than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had the principle of the non @-@ approved constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a backdoor . &quot;
the press never denied him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly fl@@ aps on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he didn &apos;t need time for me - seems to repeat N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 &apos;s - a mistake back then and today .
&quot; it can last but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position on Europe is - I express it friendly - in development .
he says we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional anti @-@ b@@ umping tendency and the wil@@ der feelings of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can say yes to everyone . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; Ein Ben@@ n , &quot; but not Benn@@ ett &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television this week said that Cor@@ by@@ &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell as a law firm was a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the 70 @-@ er years when his old father tried to be loyal to his cabinet colleagues , without going too far and losing his cabinet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos; battle was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ ing &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his fellow campaig@@ ners and de@@ pu@@ ties on Monday evening after all reports . &quot;
&quot; whatever the stir@@ red bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - News @-@ discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and treas@@ on . &quot;
&quot; it is right to give Cameron no free map for Europe , which allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins surely thinks like that .
&quot; but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities for EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite Siege economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among lef@@ tist dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato , Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not launch a campaign to leave - foreign diplom@@ ats will be required to try to find a sense for their superi@@ ors at home . &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspi@@ cious voters - to make concessions to the British if all this can be sen@@ sel@@ ess ?
&quot; the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military service in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction by the T@@ ory government in power what I was reminded on Monday of something that was called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum . &quot;
experts critic@@ ise Public Health England report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking emerged from a meeting of 12 people , some with links to the tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) concluded Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( p@@ he ) in her report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; he published the &quot; &quot; Basic Report &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; extraordinarily win@@ dy fund@@ ament &quot; on which he founded his most important conclusion .
two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims are based on stone or sand .
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
they said the public anticip@@ ates that the claim of p@@ he that &quot; the current best estimate is that e cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( MC@@ DA ) to demonstrate their opinions on the damage caused by various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were sum@@ mar@@ ised in a research report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously received British American Tob@@ acco resources ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot;
&quot; he also signed the references of BA@@ T for Public Health in a sustainability report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants agreed on the meeting to obtain funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the funding he was supposed to receive from the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International earlier , added them . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for selecting the members of the board are not provided , but there are several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which also include a sector financing in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
&quot; at the meeting , the tobacco line of p@@ he took part . &quot;
&quot; the Group &apos;s research work &quot; conf@@ esses &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for most products damage to most of the criteria , &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well wrote . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these connections or restrictions are discussed in the p@@ he report . &quot;
&quot; Mr Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that the claims that &quot; &quot; there is no evidence so far that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smokers &quot; &quot; were premature . &quot;
&quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and Well @-@ Being at P@@ he , said that the BM@@ J &apos;s claims had already been re@@ acted . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; E cigar@@ ettes are substantially less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot;
every second lifel@@ ong smo@@ ker dies at his addiction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are small compared to that , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; he has the clear obligation to inform the public about what evidence shows and what not , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers in comparison to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; almost 80@@ ,000 people die every year on a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs two billion pounds per year for the National Health System . &quot;
&quot; by clear evidence of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction . &quot;
BBC should give up east@@ ward notes former boss of Channel 4
&quot; the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ ers and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square soap . &quot;
Johnson said the broadcast fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for making public @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience in hard @-@ cont@@ ested tim@@ elines against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and channels like BB@@ C@@ 4 .
&quot; after the BBC &apos;s Director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he had been trying to get in touch with the BBC for six years at Channel 4 . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which would also clearly be shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; Johnson said to the House Communication Committee as part of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the broadcast fee , which I don &apos;t consider mid@@ - or long @-@ term for a good idea , you should at least rely on programs that others do not do or commissioned . &quot;
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve as much support as possible for their future .
&quot; the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s non@@ sense of course . &quot;
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax @-@ funded programs could be financed even without subsidies .
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ erin is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions . &quot;
&quot; to be honest , other channels would give their right arm for it . &quot;
I am obliged to see how this should be public @-@ legal TV .
I don &apos;t think this would dimin@@ ish the BBC .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepreneur for series who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for reviews because of the ambition of the people who work there and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC show what the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows like East@@ ers should be selling . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , but they perform their tasks and they can argue when they go to their apparent missions to justify £ 4 billion , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them into a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; to the broadcast fee , Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value here . &quot;
&quot; of course , all of us think we all think that one gets a great value here for £ 150 per year , but for people who are a lot of money for the £ 150 , I wonder if that is true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also testified before the committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should review its &quot; Rei@@ thi@@ an Mission , &quot; to inform , train and enter@@ tain . &quot;
&quot; he said that only little of the BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0,1 % on the radio - and she was supposed to take an example at the public TV stations in Australia and Canada . &quot;
&quot; on the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said that the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and with the commercial Sen@@ ders Alli@@ ances to make everything available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells through sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound pulses .
scientists have bred worms using genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound pulses that have high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
&quot; the impulses work through the switch @-@ on of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells , which are genetically modified to carry the di@@ aph@@ rag@@ m channels that respond to ultrasound waves . &quot;
further on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; researchers said that the worms showed the power of a new method called son@@ o@@ genetics , where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ azi@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , told the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace the depths brain stimulation , a invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people for the treatment of symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; round@@ worms usually do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ azi@@ ani found that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic bubbles . &quot;
&quot; the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which then penetrate into the worms . &quot;
&quot; the ampli@@ fied ultras@@ onic waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels , and found in the di@@ aph@@ rag@@ ms of some of the worms . &quot;
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to such a report Nature Communications .
&quot; to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ azi@@ ani genetically modified worms so that some of their Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels . &quot;
&quot; when applied ultrasound to the altered creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bubbles and transferred to the worms , where they turn on the modified Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ onen . &quot;
&quot; the process has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground @-@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light . &quot;
but Chal@@ azi@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , which needs to be sent down to the desired location in the brain at an optical fiber , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves can pass freely and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the targeted human neur@@ ons temporarily susceptible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells .

&quot; V@@ C@@ CP Creative Director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence , which was around the advertising for the weapons fair - through a lead of the Excel calendar - and thought , &quot; Give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
&quot; they played with the invention of a realistic z@@ oo@@ ky company advertising , but &quot; through the blu@@ stering with bright colours and animation , it remains sti@@ cking . &quot;
&quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair , &quot; &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty . &quot;
what we need now is the intervention of the British government and the guarantee that torture instruments are not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally in front of our front door .

eight golden rules for living in student dormit@@ ories
&quot; eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old , I moved into a student residence , still in the belief in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se s@@ miles of those whom I have anger@@ ed - and to the numerous , lengthy complaints about others . &quot;
most of what I have learned can be disti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the entry into student residence is from slightly nerve @-@ wra@@ cking up to absolutely terri@@ fying .
&quot; it &apos;s temp@@ ting to sh@@ atter : people tell wh@@ ence you come from , whether and where you have taken Sab@@ baths , where you stand in terms of Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &apos;re honest , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others do the same - ask questions and show interest .
&quot; it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like in contrast to those with whom you would not speak , even if your eyel@@ ashes were burning and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be . &quot;
allow people to be .
&quot; the rooms of people often turn into beverage reception , movie night venue and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people put on and adjust their under@@ wear . &quot;
related : do not remember to start a relationship at the university
intro@@ ver@@ ted receive rough treatment at the university .
&quot; your room should be a refuge , but many student residence halls form a room @-@ to @-@ space bum@@ ble@@ bee culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifel@@ ong friendship . &quot;
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
&quot; nothing in the culture allows you to say , &quot; I like you and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I can get back the energy that I consumed for interaction with you . &quot;
try to sense when a fellow student of con@@ vivi@@ ality is exhausted - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking out .
speaking of rank@@ ings : do it .
a guy in my student residence had the idea that an open door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship with B@@ aking .
&quot; as you start the university at the climax of the back @-@ man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &apos;s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I baked you something . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to talk and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
&quot; bad mixes of flour , sugar and fat result in people sleeping when they kno@@ ck . &quot;
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student resi@@ dences .
&quot; of course , the c@@ law of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea also ? &quot;
check that with the milk owner .
&quot; chances are good that they say they serve themselves , even if they cook inside . &quot;
&quot; if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it more balanced than my room@@ mate , who added a dish@@ washing deterg@@ ent to her milk to punish thi@@ eves . &quot;
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or work .
&quot; it is not just about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people sitting in the glass house in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb . &quot;
&quot; a girl in my corridor asked her neighbors , if it was something for them to make drum and bass a little qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
they re@@ acted with even more loud music .
&quot; when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbors to sleep for two hours before she left her own music , shut her door and went to her three hour test . &quot;
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would accidentally move into the same student residence ?
&quot; on the other hand , it wouldn &apos;t be ground@@ less embarrass@@ ing if you are holding a room@@ mate for your future spouse , going to her , separating herself and seeing her every day and perhaps witn@@ essing how she treats all common friends to herself ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes his own ways - but if a hot fellow @-@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to persu@@ ade your subordin@@ ate a little reason . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment you notice that someone has lost his keys in his un@@ locked room , the border between an Ul@@ k and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good stup@@ idity is funny , but it only takes moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
place a valuable and am@@ using lesson on safety through hiding - but never forget someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door and place your keys in a glass of water which you then put in the freezer - but stap@@ le your possessions on the ceiling no more than twice .
&quot; holiday homes for refugees , single parents , low @-@ income families &quot;
the real estate entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner builds town@@ houses for people who don &apos;t have much money .
&quot; for example , for refugees , but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need housing , but also the single mother and the low @-@ servant . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build and build well today , &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner has believed to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : he is building housing houses for refugees in a project .
&quot; Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
because people stay here for a large part .
&quot; in view of the influ@@ x of refugees , we need sufficient living space in the coming decades . &quot;
a very ban@@ al three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a terra@@ ced house needs the least amount of space .
it makes integration easier .
this is different when people are accommod@@ ated in blocks of flats .
&quot; each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a lounge . &quot;
&quot; it may be that many refugees say it is peace again , I go back . &quot;
then the houses can be easily changed according to their respective needs .
how high are the costs ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 18@@ 4 000 Euros , without property . &quot;
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
construction took six months .
that is reasonable .
have the building regulations complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : I have applied my project correctly .
especially complicated it always makes the im@@ pending Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the pitch regulation .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
&quot; it is still under@@ represented , who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three pitches . &quot;
only in the cities is missing the place .
and refugees and asylum seekers do not have cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced housing project ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : there were some , who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers . &quot;
which definitely is not right .
but do you not tigh@@ ten the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : it &apos;s true : over the last five years , we had a construction boom in Germany , but we built luxury apartments that could hardly afford any more . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , even the normal people need living space . &quot;
&quot; not only refugees , but also the single mother or the low @-@ ear@@ er . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build , even today , cheap and good . &quot;
that &apos;s what it &apos;s all about .

&quot; some have encountered problems after installation , because they get an error message telling that the &quot; &quot; software update failed &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to avoid the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush goes back or try to update via iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
&quot; this may be the del@@ e@@ tion of apps to create space - but Apple has made it more impro@@ b@@ able by t@@ abling the update . similarly , it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install it once the process is complete . &quot;
&quot; it is worthwhile to make sure your mobile phone is charged while updating or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged . &quot;
&quot; if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue , as the telephone may shut down mid@@ way and this could lead to an abor@@ tion of the update . &quot;

Ros@@ enberg &apos;s only motto : full attack
&quot; in the fight for the championship title in Formula 1 , N@@ ico Ros@@ berg knows only one motto against his clearly leading Mercedes team @-@ mate Lewis Hamilton : &quot; full attack . &quot; &quot;
&quot; before the start , the World Cup second st@@ alled in the decisive seven overseas races , &quot; &quot; that I have nothing to lose . &quot;
53 points separate the runner @-@ up champion before the night race in Singapore this Sunday by title defender and two @-@ time champion Hamilton .
the Brit@@ on won seven of the twelve season races so far and won the flood light Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite .

whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will affect the Grand Prix of Singapore is still unclear .

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
&quot; the chess club &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen , &quot; which was founded three months ago , has added another member to its ranks , thus increasing the number of members to 19 players . &quot;
&quot; the new member is the entrepreneur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player who stayed for more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen . &quot;
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the carrier of the Federal Cross @-@ Service Cross 1st class and honorary citizen of the cities of Esp@@ el@@ k@@ amp and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann has supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation which supports Alfred Klein .
&quot; thus , it is possible to record chess players who cannot raise the membership fee . &quot;
youth work and talent search are to be promoted as well .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that the membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; is seen as an expression of his connection with the spa town .
Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro is looking for direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Anton@@ ist Centre have joined the Social Foundation &apos;s man@@ tle and opened a new contact point at the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg Square .
&quot; in addition to consulting , you can also take part in courses . &quot;
the social foundation dra@@ gs it down from the mountain into the inner city .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was recently opened there .
&quot; here , immediately next to the shopping market , sen@@ iors and counsel@@ ors receive information on questions such as nursing insurance or services of the health insurance companies . &quot;
&quot; for years , we have been working with our out@@ patient care service to ensure that family members are often left alone . &quot;
there are endless questions .
&quot; the new homes in Jut@@ ta Wei@@ g@@ and , which is also responsible for the Anton@@ ist and the Bürger@@ hospital as well as for the ambul@@ atory service &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us , &quot; are not seldom taken advantage of . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat . &quot;
&quot; therefore , you can use additional offers such as crash prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapy treatment . &quot;
the offers from the sen@@ iors centre and the Sal@@ u@@ di complement each other ideally .
&quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and re@@ hab . &quot;
&quot; the Senior Centre for Care and Nur@@ sing , &quot; &quot; described Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot;
both business leaders see the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre especially in demographic change .
because this makes a good decentr@@ alized infrastructure indispensable in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future .
&quot; in addition , Mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined at the inaugur@@ ation celebrations , the district office also dedicated itself to the club meeting at the age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular soci@@ able gathering . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the Social Foundation makes a big contribution that sen@@ iors can live as independent and well in their familiar environment as possible . &quot;
&quot; the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Satur@@ days from 10 : 00 to 12 : 00 . &quot;

Vienna architect Karl M@@ ang died of age 92
&quot; Karl M@@ ang , one of the Do@@ y@@ ens of Vienna &apos;s architecture , is dead . &quot;
&quot; he died on 5 September at the age of 92 , as the artist &apos;s house announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; with M@@ ang , the Künstler@@ haus left an honorary member and at the same time &quot; one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna , &quot; as was called in the extension . &quot;
&quot; born in Vienna in 1922 , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Technical University in Vienna at Friedrich Leh@@ mann during and after the Second World War . &quot;
&quot; since 1952 he worked as a freelance architect , but also worked as a teacher , writer and institute manager . &quot;
&quot; from 1972 to 1983 , he was President of the Austrian Institute of Design . &quot;
&quot; in the eigh@@ ties , he was commissioned to set up the treas@@ ury in the Hof@@ burg of Vienna and the reconstruction of the palace Lob@@ ko@@ witz in the Austrian Theatre Museum . &quot;

&quot; after that , Wiese was stor@@ med out of the shop , insul@@ ted the be@@ amer , and threw away the fine fine before the feet , as reported by the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper . &quot;
&quot; with the city of Bremen , one confirms the accus@@ ations , but it is not clear about the consequences for the unusual incident . &quot;
&quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; said the city of Bremen . &quot;

men beating up to 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
&quot; witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , around 23.@@ 45 o &apos;clock , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den in the direction of Sal@@ mün@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , one of the group , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ an , followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him . &quot;
at this time the group was at the level of the b@@ ft fuel station .
there were also three people on the site of the gas station .
&quot; one of these men cried out to the young man , and struck him with his fist . &quot;
the victim suffered a n@@ os@@ her@@ nia and bleeding heavily from the nose .
&quot; when his two friends hur@@ ried and appe@@ aled to the bat , he left his victim first . &quot;
&quot; from his friends , the injured young man was brought home . &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator pursued the group with a passenger car up to their home and demonstr@@ atively drove past there several times .
&quot; when the vehicle was no longer seen , the wounded escaped the building to smoke a cigarette . &quot;
there he was attacked again by the ra@@ cket and another male person .
&quot; with the help of a head@@ stock , one examined the victim &apos;s face and the thi@@ ghs of the victim . &quot;
the injured person had to be hospit@@ alized for medical care .
&quot; until now , only a vag@@ ue description of the day is available . &quot;

Dr. Frank Müller takes practice in field breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros
&quot; Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) , take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ stel@@ ausen . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the mayor of Saxony , Bernd Bor@@ mann , is also pleased to welcome the economic promotion U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert . &quot;
&quot; in many places in the country doctors are missing - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , is lucky : on October 1 Dr. Frank Müller will take over the field breaks . &quot;
&quot; while Ur@@ sel goes into retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still standing at the side of his successor in the next few months . &quot;
&quot; after a conversion phase , Müller opens the practice on 12 October , until then he will invest 3@@ 10,000 euros in the premises on St. Mar@@ cell@@ us street 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was a lot of sympathy at first sight when the ri@@ ms met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who are currently doing their specialist training at the Ver@@ den Hospital and who will also go into practice next year . &quot;
&quot; we always had the mind that the rub@@ b@@ ish would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ stand@@ ings , laughing . &quot;
&quot; when it was ready , I just ph@@ oned her . &quot;
the idea was to operate in A@@ sen@@ dorf &apos;s own practice in the future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot;
we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years .
&quot; as an advantage , he also sees his own boss . &quot;
&quot; and so they agreed , the rub@@ b@@ ish bought the house with the practice . &quot;
meanwhile they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
&quot; the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller was also raised there , his medical studies in Hannover followed in several medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; he is currently active as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed a Senior Physi@@ cian in Di@@ ep@@ holz and engaged in the DRC &apos;s willingness to participate in the DRC . &quot;
&quot; as of September 19 , the practice for the new boss will be prepared . &quot;
&quot; while the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ lows works as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ ist ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the mil@@ ler , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle down as a general practitioner . &quot;
&quot; the final endos@@ copy comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot;
&quot; after the renovation , the rooms will look more modern . &quot;
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and exercise EC@@ Gs and need more subscri@@ ber rooms .
&quot; in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed . &quot;
&quot; a grant of 50@@ 000 Euros will receive the rub@@ b@@ ish in the framework of a subsi@@ dy programme from the administrative district ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) as well as from the joint municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice will continue , &quot; emphas@@ ises Zambia Lord Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 2000 patients come into practice in the field of field breaks every quarter , in the average German average practice it is about 500 . &quot;
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another GP practice .
&quot; a positive side effect of the practical tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : according to Ur@@ sel , the Phar@@ m@@ acy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; if no successor had found himself , it would have gone too . &quot;
&quot; by the way , anyone who visits Müll@@ ers speaking , also looks at familiar faces : take over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power from the ri@@ ms . &quot;
&quot; their farewell ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf , after all the doctors have practi@@ sed there for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; recalls Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ce@@ ausen with a smile . &quot;
&quot; after a long time , she felt a little sad@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; but we are still living in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients often , &quot; &quot; says the dormit@@ ory . &quot;
her husband laughs : &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter plot . &quot;
&quot; so far , I have always pushed myself against gardening , now that could be different . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees through &quot;
&quot; now border checks are also lifted up at our southern border , &quot; said Minister Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border are maintained parallel to this .
&quot; it is clear , however , that anyone who wants to submit a request for asylum is also &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of people is in the foreground .
&quot; but it should also be clear that there are clear signals , &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; people must know that we do not accept bound@@ less migration flows , nor about the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it takes a controlled procedure .
Croatia is considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia refused
&quot; the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would continue to travel in the direction of Austria and Germany and , under certain circumstances , set up cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees . &quot;
&quot; the Minister of Interior , Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach however did not look like this . &quot;
&quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - above all to Hungary . &quot;
&quot; the border with Croatia , on the other hand , is already strongly controlled as the exterior ceiling of the Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; as the Minister stressed , Sloven@@ ian wants not to abri@@ dge its borders for refugees . &quot;
&quot; every member of the EU must fulfill its obligations , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours on Tuesday to pass the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id in eastern Croatia to avoid the registration . &quot;
the Croatian police were able to attack them in the nearby corn fields .
&quot; according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik continuously meets police cars with new refugees . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children . &quot;
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; in the coming days , his country reck@@ ons with about 4,000 refugees , said Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo along the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which previously led migrants to the Hungarian border , were re@@ directed towards Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the Belgrade government , however , denied that it was the people attacking certain routes : &quot; we can neither , nor do we want to do so , &quot; it meant . &quot;
&quot; according to the media reports , a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id in the morning , in the course of the day further buses would be expected . &quot;
&quot; Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
&quot; the in@@ mates were on the way through Serbia , around 500 kilometres away from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border . &quot;
&quot; we have heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police said that we should drive here , &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the postpon@@ ement of the Balkan Route of Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary , already predicted by observers , could now come to a somewhat further west @-@ west route . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive border control options &quot;
Croatia &apos;s interior minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had pointed out that his country had prepared plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
he did not mention details but pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; extensive possibilities for border control . &quot;
you carry out strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently testified about the standard of border controls to the country since then . &quot;
&quot; on the Serbian side , about 300 refugees continue to hide behind the Hungarian border fence . &quot;
&quot; according to the media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , the two cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed . &quot;
it is still unclear whether the remaining refugees will continue to travel to the Croatian border .
&quot; Wednesday morning , the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic was trying to calm down the debates on alternative routes of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed , for premature . &quot;
there would not be very high refugee numbers at this time .
&quot; one could not yet say whether they would continue their journey across Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
hel@@ pers advise migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun distributing maps on which alternative routes are drawn by Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still not cleared mine fields . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region . &quot;
stock exchanges : Ukra@@ inians made 30 million dollars

&quot; with the captured information , insi@@ der businesses should have been made in the financial markets . &quot;
&quot; thus , a total of over $ 100 million was launched to the investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our national borders will ultimately be caught , &quot; said the SE@@ C announcement . &quot;
&quot; in this case , the proceedings against 32 additional accused took place . &quot;

&quot; the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce , with this action , drew attention to its 20th anniversary and is quite confronted with mixed reactions . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went through the action in the middle of the city and among the people , &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot;
the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce is also available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as for questions and discussions as the volunteers .
&quot; while some pass@@ ant spontaneously reaches the chal@@ k and the proposition for &quot; &quot; affir@@ m my life &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; not suffer long &quot; , &quot; others remain short , others remain short , read , say sentences like &quot; &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; &quot; and go on . &quot;
&quot; again and again , small discussions develop on the ver@@ ge of the action , about life , dealing with dying . &quot;
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .

&quot; therefore , this public @-@ effective action for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old is good . &quot;
&quot; not everyone wants to express themselves publicly on the tablets , however , be understandable , after all , it is a very personal thing . &quot;
&quot; the subject of death and death is still associated with tab@@ oos , such as the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has contributed much to the opening of the people . &quot;

&quot; when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid was sought by the appeal of an honorary officer , she immediately reported herself and had been there when it was founded in 1995 . &quot;
&quot; Go@@ def@@ roid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the suffer@@ ers and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in hos@@ pi@@ ce Sankt Vincent . &quot;
they are all carefully trained .
An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid can cope well with her job and experiences and experiences .

the offer of out@@ patient E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free of charge and denom@@ in@@ ational .

F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ result mixed with financial prospects for 2016
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appo@@ inting results for the last quarter , and the delivery giant lowered its prospects for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its body@@ work service . &quot;
&quot; the company also said that she plans to hire about 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holiday . &quot;
&quot; at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season . &quot;
the share fell by 2.5 percent in pre @-@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. ple@@ dged to earn a profit from $ 10,@@ 40 and 10,@@ 90 $ in the financial year , which ends in May , 20 cent less than in previous forecast . &quot;
analysts predicted a survey of Fac@@ t@@ set 10,@@ 84 $ . &quot;
&quot; the lower view comes in spite of the price increases , which are 4.@@ 9 percent average and effective on January 4 and in spite of higher allow@@ ances for ground transport of heavy and large packages , which will be le@@ vi@@ ed in November . &quot;
&quot; the company said it nonetheless expected that the result will increase over the previous year as a result of lower costs , higher revenues , and growth in online trading . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company has &quot; &quot; solid income &quot; &quot; considering the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trading . &quot;
&quot; the plans for vacation rental were announced one day later than the rival U@@ PS , who plans to hire 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , roughly the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter that ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; earnings per share stood at $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just below the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , which predicted twelve analysts at Z@@ ack &apos;s Investment Research . &quot;
sales rose by 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
analysts questioned by Z@@ ack expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
&quot; in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has reported a decline in international priority shipping , which resulted in sales in his unit Express shipments to stagn@@ ate . &quot;
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex .
&quot; in the last quarter , sales of bo@@ d@@ land transport rose by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
&quot; the Express unit recorded higher earnings due to higher prices , while earnings fell due to higher operating costs in the freight business . &quot;
&quot; in the after@@ market trading , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares dropped by $ 3.@@ 85 , or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0.@@ 15 . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , they concluded with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 . &quot;
&quot; at its most expected meeting in the year , Federal Reserve Strate@@ gen spent two days this week sitting around a 27 @-@ foot Hondur@@ an Ma@@ hag@@ oni table to decide whether it &apos;s time to raise the benchmark for the first time for almost a decade . &quot;
&quot; facing them at an end of the decorated , two @-@ storey session hall , there is a mur@@ al of the United States . &quot;
the card is a reminder that F@@ ed Chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation in front of all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ fold mission from Congress : keeping US employment and prices stable here .
&quot; but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict them . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from an unprecedented incentive by the near @-@ zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
&quot; although most data in the economy show that it grows solid , the latest tur@@ mo@@ il on global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives anxious to strengthen this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal securities - and even a quarter percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation in the first place will be the most important thing they can observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not raise interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; she said . &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do what is unsure of itself to the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists who were recently inter@@ viewed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted an interest rate increase this week .
&quot; however , the financial markets await the F@@ ed , with a key indicator showing only a 30 % chance of an increase . &quot;
&quot; this points to a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the rate , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts allevi@@ ate the blow by promising that another increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage Value jumped by 21.@@ 28.@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the set this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief Econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that point , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she does , &quot; she would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot;
other experts argued that interest rate increase would calm the financial markets because they would eliminate the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act .
&quot; a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed on a good way to raise the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow sharpen@@ ing of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that in this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , she expected more economic progress , an increase in the sentence . &quot;
&quot; although job creation slow@@ ed in August , the improvement in the labour market in this year was solid . &quot;
&quot; unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and close to the level that the F@@ ed envis@@ ages as full employment . &quot;
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; although inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ ley , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macroeconomics . &quot;
but financial markets all over the world contracted in the end of the last month after China had de@@ valued its currency .
&quot; the Dow Jones Industrial average value fell by more than 16 % in May , while investors feared that a slow@@ down in the Chinese economy would stran@@ gle global growth . &quot;
the market recovered slightly this month whereas the Dow is now around 10 % below the May pole .
&quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , the market turbul@@ ence influences the complex calculation , when one should increase interest rates . &quot;
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks , they would tigh@@ ten the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former colleague of the US central bank . &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least a month to get a grip on the effects .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the effects on the US economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the health of the global economy is not the main concern of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be involved technically when making decisions . &quot;
but in the end the F@@ ed has become the world &apos;s monetary authority .
the influence of the central bank in recent years has been enormous .
&quot; the mere indication of Ben S. Bern@@ anke , then leader of the time in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow &quot; their monetary expansion , dis@@ b@@ anded con@@ fu@@ sions around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , F@@ ed representatives can expect them not only to monitor developments elsewhere , but also with other central banks and experts to get a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; The F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements that are apparently not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
&quot; varn@@ ished , right @-@ vo@@ iced member of the Federal Open Market Committee , dedicated to raising interest rates , made decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia led the F@@ ed to reduce their interest rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three meetings &quot; &quot; despite limited identi@@ fiable effects on growth in the US , &quot; &quot; said Lack@@ ier . &quot;
&quot; one year later , the F@@ ed representatives did reverse these cuts . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ ed should place aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market re@@ unification , &quot; said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee for the Bank of England &apos;s interest rates . &quot;
&quot; the latest turbul@@ ence does not come close to this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of raising her interest because the markets are moving , &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , president of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t think it should ha@@ sten the time . &quot;

&quot; even if the shop is well visited , it is not difficult to find a parking place . &quot;
Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : little help for refugees
more and more refugees are coming to Germany these days .
to prepare a warm welcome is not without the commitment of countless volunteer hel@@ pers .
&quot; in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da , too , there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city . &quot;
Petra and Klaus H@@ eine belong to them .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still likes to teach with her 74 L@@ ess@@ ons .
&quot; every Thursday , she does it in the asylum seekers heim at the D@@ ill@@ inger Straße . &quot;
&quot; there they help refugees from Syria , Kurdist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language . &quot;
&quot; of course , this is quite a different lesson than at a real school . &quot;
Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ atric society Rio Grande promotes healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ atric organisation SP@@ RS attempts to educ@@ ate women on how important good nutrition during breast@@ feeding is . she does this with the presentation of images of babies who su@@ ck up breasts that are painted with representations of un@@ healthy food .
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , giving babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by approximately 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research suggests that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can neg@@ atively affect the immune system . &quot;
exceptions for the new Bern@@ ina sports hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ried accepted the contract for the 2.3 million Euro @-@ expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be fl@@ atter for solar panels .
&quot; the planning for the long @-@ awaited school hall building at the Bern@@ ina sports area is progres@@ sing step by step : in the latest joint meeting , the elabor@@ ated building request was unanim@@ ously approved without major discussions . &quot;
&quot; previously , the Panel had decided to apply for a &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; of the valid development plan . &quot;
&quot; for the &quot; exception , &quot; permission for a special form concerning the roof construction was given . &quot;
&quot; therefore a &quot; &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ center first and roof top &quot; &quot; is to be built . &quot;
&quot; the planning is the intended use of the roof surface for solar plants : &quot; &quot; this gives us a wonderfully large south roof , &quot; &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot;
&quot; in the case of &quot; liberation , &quot; the roof @-@ ti@@ lt , which for energetic reasons - was stipul@@ ated differently from the development plan - was to lie below 10 degrees . &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan regarding the roof til@@ ting permits no &quot; exceptions , &quot; whereby the Municipal Council is usually more restric@@ tive when it comes to liber@@ ating applications . &quot;
&quot; however , the turn@@ out is not a recurring project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the gym@@ nasi@@ um building at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
costs are estimated at some 2.3 million euros .
grants are expected by Schul@@ - und Brei@@ ten@@ sport@@ sponsor@@ ing .
&quot; in the next step , the building request for the 18 x 36 meter hall will be presented to the District Council for consideration . &quot;
P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg Klinik moves to Sch@@ on@@ gau
the hospital P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg should be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
&quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed new medical director at the Sch@@ on@@ gau hospital . &quot;
the station and the majority of the staff move from P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg to Sch@@ on@@ gau .
&quot; this is due to the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , which confirmed the Coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss . &quot;
&quot; however , a decision on this will meet the Supervisory Board and will be held on Wednesday , 23 September . &quot;
&quot; should the plans be implemented , all of the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg would continue . &quot;
the vast majority should move with fishermen and the existing In@@ ner Station to Sch@@ on@@ gau .
the rooms are available .
&quot; employees , who are not able to travel to Sch@@ on@@ gau , should be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
the employees were informed of the plans .
&quot; the change was triggered by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Klinik since the beginning of the year and is now switching to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into the game , who agreed to take the lead on October 1 and to switch to Sch@@ on@@ gau with his team . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ on@@ gau , this means &quot; upgrading &quot; and spreading the offer in the field of &quot; Internal Medicine , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ on@@ gau ( 180 beds ) is specialised on the In@@ ner Station on gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
&quot; for the next two years , Fis@@ her@@ man with his team , if the Supervisory Board agrees , will lead both houses until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ ernity , which still has 35 beds , is to be finally closed in P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg after almost 140 years . &quot;
&quot; until now , the county had planned this for 2018 , when the current refurb@@ ishment at the Wei@@ l@@ heim Hospital has been completed . &quot;
&quot; Land@@ Coun@@ cill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , met rum@@ ours that the house , which is owned by the Federal Government , will in future be used as an accommodation for asylum @-@ seekers . &quot;
&quot; this is what I conclude . &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß was not able to say that there were several considerations . &quot;
&quot; currently , there is a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a daily psychiat@@ ry . &quot;
&quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity is not coming again , &quot; says Fischer of the Qu@@ asi Mo@@ ving to the Le@@ ch , who had been received &quot; positively and very understanding &quot; by the employees . &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as a chief physician for more than 30 years , has not given it . &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
&quot; the hospital P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was threatened by closure in recent decades , detach@@ ments were closed , for example surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics . &quot;
the hand@@ cu@@ ffs of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar Lion are challenged tonight at Berg@@ ische HC tonight ( 20.@@ 15 hrs ) .

Jag@@ ast@@ y with two injured in Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during their maize harvesting on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( Land@@ kreis Witt@@ enberg ) , several hunters were in use , as the police announced . &quot;
after a shot a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospital .
how exactly it could come to the accident was unclear at first .
the crime police as@@ cer@@ tained .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a suspect has led the police to the cor@@ pse of 16 @-@ year @-@ old people from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
&quot; in interro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old gave to the killing of young people and throwing their bodies into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate has fallen victim to a violent crime .
&quot; the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as public prosec@@ utor and police announced on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , who was also arrested on Tuesday evening , was also considered to be a suspect , and the investig@@ ators lead to the discovery site of the cor@@ pse . &quot;
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was reported missing on Sunday morning after a visit to an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen did not come home after a visit of an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
&quot; in search of the young woman , investig@@ ators first encountered personal items of the victim . &quot;
&quot; in the case of interro@@ gations in the circle of friends and acquaint@@ ances of the missing persons , there was finally a suspicion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
the presum@@ ed perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the body was found .
&quot; according to the authorities , the arrest dealt with the police interro@@ gation that the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had killed and put the cor@@ pse in the canal . &quot;
&quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented to the fun@@ nel on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put him in charge . &quot;
the further investigations shall be carried out on the basis of the immediate circumstances of the act .
refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing gap
the situation in the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are seeking an affordable place to stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing is facing a challenge .
the distribution struggles on the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; with the incoming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities . &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable apartments .
&quot; to meet demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 . &quot;
this is the result of a study commissioned by the Union Con@@ federation &quot; Social H@@ ousing . &quot;
&quot; by comparison : this year 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are finished in Germany . &quot;
&quot; in this way , 140@@ ,000 apartments are missing . &quot;
&quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer oblig@@ ated to live as asylum seekers in an initial lodging . &quot;
many then come across the housing market and enter the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
&quot; according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seekers lived for the last year . &quot;
&quot; however , the negative trend in the housing market is not only due to the rising number of refugees . &quot;
the study also makes significant savings in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany is shooting a housing deficit which will grow from year to year .
&quot; currently , around 77@@ ,000 residential units have already been missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , compla@@ ins Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , many professionals lived in large @-@ scale cities in a not@@ e@@ worthy manner in WG @-@ rooms . &quot;
young adults stayed longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; because of the loud sl@@ ack@@ ness on the housing market .
&quot; in the big cities , the number of square metres per cap@@ ita in the past few years has sun@@ k again for the first time . &quot;
&quot; in order to solve the problem , the &quot; Social H@@ ousing &quot; alliance proposes a re@@ boot . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , new incentives should boost social housing development . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the tax exemp@@ tion tax could be wai@@ ved and the property tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats may be suspended . &quot;
&quot; in addition , attractive tax depreci@@ ation options are required according to the Alliance . &quot;
the subsi@@ dy programme for refugee shel@@ ters from the state bank Kf@@ W is already well received in cities and municipalities .
&quot; a good week after the start , more than half of the available around 300 million euros had already been raised on Monday evening with 18@@ 4 million euros . &quot;
&quot; now , the project could even be increased . &quot;
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia wre@@ ak a corridor
&quot; after Hungary there is practically no more passing , as more and more refugees elect the way across Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb canc@@ els the transit across Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke to Sloven@@ ian Minister of the Interior , and if necessary we will organise a corridor , &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Minister of Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
the EU @-@ Land of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
&quot; after the deportation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe . &quot;
&quot; 500 people came across the border near T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian television station RT@@ L . &quot;
Hungary had closed its border for refugees on the day before .
&quot; moreover , new laws that came into force on the same day make decent asylum procedures in Hungary virtually superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic said : &quot; &quot; they can travel through and we prepare for this possibility . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;
&quot; however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , the Croatian police took up the first refugees at Serbia &apos;s border to the EU neighbouring country of Croatia . &quot;
&quot; according to media reports , most of the media reports are from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they came by bus as well as taxis in the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
&quot; immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk over the green border to Croatia . &quot;
&quot; at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees don &apos;t come across borders . &quot;
&quot; for this , the border strip has other dangers : there are sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 90@@ s . &quot;
min@@ e@@ fields are now to quickly create a safe passage .
&quot; after Hungary , however , hardly any refugees come to the border after the border closure . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the police counted 3@@ 66 people attacked . &quot;
shortly before closing on Monday they had been 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws prec@@ lu@@ de the overcoming and damage of the border fence as a crime .
&quot; therefore , 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in Sz@@ eg@@ ed &apos;s southern @-@ Hungarian border town . &quot;
sentences are threatening imprisonment up to five years and deportation from the country .
&quot; according to the immigration authority , 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the newly established &quot; transit zones &quot; on Tuesday , almost all of them - 93 - on the most important transition from R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; among the applicants , there are 13 families with small children and two elderly people . &quot;
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees .
&quot; practically , however , no one has the prospect of obtaining asylum in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; according to Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; safe third country . &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers are to be de@@ ported .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
&quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , workers began to fail . &quot;
they collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people left at the road@@ side in the past weeks .
barriers were broken down and one of the shooting camps in the border area was rebuilt .
nobody wanted to comment on the purpose of this conversion .
&quot; after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria is only a few refugees . &quot;
the country has also enhanced its border controls .
&quot; about 20,000 migrants were still in the country according to government information . &quot;
&quot; in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the continuation of the journey to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped at the instruction of German authorities . &quot;
in Frei@@ las@@ sing smaller groups of refugees met on foot regularly .
&quot; mayor drove &quot; &quot; str@@ anded &quot; &quot; across the border &quot;
&quot; we were busy with the clearing after the bridge on Sunday , when suddenly ten people with travel agents stood at the entrance of the tent , &quot; said W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins Mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot;
tourists wanted to travel by train to Passa@@ u .
&quot; because Germany had unexpectedly hired the railway traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the influ@@ x of refugees , Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the borders together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the Na@@ he Passa@@ u . &quot;
&quot; before that , we brought the un@@ hoped guests only once , with snack and drink . &quot;
we said immediately that we bring them by car to Passa@@ u .
&quot; that was a matter of course for us , &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let himself be given a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ gade .
&quot; that made us very happy , &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; the str@@ anded train passengers had switched from one ICE to Passa@@ u on Sunday evening in W@@ els , in order to try after the short notice that the railway traffic to Germany was stopped , but still over the border . &quot;
&quot; however , the regional train was turned off at the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn . &quot;
&quot; in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high in the course . &quot;
&quot; the bridge @-@ party association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday was soci@@ able , on the day before a double brid@@ le run sporty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bav@@ arians from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
&quot; that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án has now sent several tens of thousands to us , is a logical result of a sacred policy : &quot;
&quot; instead of helping R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp immediately in establishing structures that ensure humanity , our federal chan@@ cell@@ or has publicly and publicly put forward the attitude of the Hungarian government to the Dun@@ st@@ kreis des National Socialism . &quot;
suff@@ erer of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the border areas .
&quot; the refugees will also find that the &quot; &quot; praised land &quot; , &quot; which has invited them and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a big challenge in the face of ongoing refugee streams and approaching winter , to establish decent conditions for asylum seekers . &quot;
&quot; and it will be even greater - peace , security and stability to uph@@ old in Austria . &quot;
&quot; Konrad in search of 35@@ ,000 winter@@ proof quarters &quot;
Konrad sh@@ attered all his hands with the expul@@ sion of refugees .
Christian Konrad is used to the fact that his word has a weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen banks to create neighbour@@ hoods for thousands of refugees .
Konrad has already got a grip on the chaos in the former tak@@ eover centre in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen .
&quot; we have no more homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported about his first success . &quot;
&quot; the placing of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was also without great vor@@ ti@@ ces , &quot; &quot; said Konrad , and praised the organisational &quot; &quot; master performance &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Interior Ministry , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in total , Konrad reck@@ ons with a demand of 85@@ ,000 quarters in the he@@ ur@@ ly year . &quot;
&quot; in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 units have to be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 are expected to provide 15,000 of the federal government . &quot;
&quot; if there are more refugees , we can do it . &quot;
&quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
he has already held talks with the provincial capitals .
&quot; they would have assured him , even for the coming refugees , to create neighbour@@ hoods . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s going well in Upper Austria , &quot; Fer@@ ry Mai@@ er said . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Con@@ rad .
&quot; tomorrow it will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , to be clari@@ fied how the Church will help . &quot;
&quot; the asylum coordinator puts great expectations also on the ORF action &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ping like us &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the platform , individuals can easily offer accommodation . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there are hopes for hotels that are empty in the winter . &quot;
Konrad and Mai@@ er yesterday critic@@ ised the standards for placing as &quot; very high . &quot;
in times of emergency it could not be that district employers had to respect a certain height of the towel holder or size of the tops .
&quot; for a temporary period , &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , he is more successful in accommodation , says Konrad , with his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am an elderly gentle@@ man , whom one does not say without further into the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
&quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er do not inc@@ ur any cost to the republic , as they themselves declared . &quot;
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
up to now the search for qu@@ arti@@ s has not been successful yet .
Konrad wanted to place a container on the Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are apparently problems with the approval .
Linz calls for a better layout
&quot; for the time being , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for housing refugees is planning the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; this is not necessary at the moment , since it is possible to accommodate those affected without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , further sites are to be tested for their suit@@ ability . &quot;
criticism of the city chief on the division of refugees within the federal state .
other districts also have to make their contribution .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
&quot; in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , provincial captain Josef P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger ( VP ) has been indic@@ ted on Monday for further action in the refugee issue . &quot;
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders will not be sealed off .
the continuing journey of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible .
&quot; however , there are now the corresponding border controls . &quot;
&quot; for the time being , special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; the guards , however , would be brought to Germany with regular trains . &quot;
&quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot;
&quot; for P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger , Austria has now also introduced controls on its borders , is &quot; a logical consequence &quot; from the action of the Germans . &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a Mat@@ ter of Time
&quot; the general refurb@@ ishment of the &quot; &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; in the industrial row in Linz is officially completed . &quot;
&quot; in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT Group is moved into S &amp; T , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square metres ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector . &quot;
&quot; in IT , smart minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T boss Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
he could imagine investing in the New Location in Star@@ tup @-@ Companies and later to acquire some of them .
from the very beginning S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; 1.7 million euros were invested by S &amp; T in the site , 3.3 million euros from Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Federation ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is le@@ ased by Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ Center .
&quot; 30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters of residual space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second shop in the Arctic
the new shop focuses on Fur@@ la hand@@ bags .
&quot; actually , Jut@@ ta wanted to get a dog . &quot;
&quot; this project had to push the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the do@@ ve markt @-@ ar@@ cade : after all , she has now received an increase in the form of another business location . &quot;
&quot; in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop , in which she sells bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothes from different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags from the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets from 75 euros . &quot;
larger bags and accessories costs up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
&quot; previously , several weeks were rebuilt . &quot;
&quot; but I have thought for a long time whether I should open a shop , &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot;
&quot; the decisive factor for the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of a site in which only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters , who herself has Italian roots . &quot;
her mode of fashion has given birth to her mother in the cra@@ dle .
I am fit most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
&quot; why so many women are in rap@@ tures when looking at a beautiful hand@@ bag , the expert can &apos;t answer with last certainty . &quot;
maybe it &apos;s because a beautiful bag re@@ inv@@ ents every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate An@@ c@@ est@@ ors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are called An@@ ders .
this property also links some with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ setting .
&quot; whether it mani@@ f@@ ests itself extern@@ ally , as far as journalists are concerned or reveals knowledge gaps in international crisis policies - the candidate for the US presidential office whi@@ ps up the election campaign vigor@@ ously . &quot;
and cut off well .
&quot; this is also recorded in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from . &quot;
&quot; the New Yorker with the term &quot; &quot; F@@ öhn@@ ende &quot; &quot; is known to many in Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the wine road . &quot;
some people in the 1200 @-@ inhabitants @-@ village are related to it over -@@ ump@@ y corners .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode . &quot;
&quot; the killer , Sim@@ one Wen@@ del , shot a film about Tr@@ ump . &quot;
and what do the villa@@ gers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find that exciting somehow , but they are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt type , &quot; Sim@@ one Wen@@ del says . &quot;
&quot; the native K@@ all@@ stadt filmed an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous shoots , including Tr@@ ump also the ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes to &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too - so with the statement that he would also be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts .
&quot; although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also the opinion that Tr@@ ump is already a bit a big mouth , &quot; Wen@@ del says . &quot;
&quot; inci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the surrounding area , &quot; &quot; Die Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; - in high German : the don@@ or , she says . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the owners . &quot;
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather immig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
the foundations of the real estate company were the first real estate purchases in New York .
&quot; but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their desire to return to the homeland in the long run , failed in the Bavarian state to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate was at that time . &quot;
&quot; the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Eth@@ no@@ graphy , Roland Paul , had declared Tr@@ ump at the start of the film . &quot;
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal immig@@ rant . &quot;
that is in contrast to the occasionally marked statements of the descend@@ ant .
he repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the USA and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; like the polar one , this is not so symp@@ a@@ thetic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative Tr@@ ump ( &quot; The Grand@@ ma was a born Tr@@ ump , the grand@@ ma was borrow@@ ed Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement sees the American rather stand@@ off@@ ish , &quot; he is always so start@@ led . &quot;
does he think that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; the pension in@@ verteb@@ rate Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ra@@ mm mentioned like some K@@ all@@ stadt that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated a visit to the church organ during a visit , which was generally well anchored . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that from Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; they would find it better if he didn &apos;t know the choice , because &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had the sa@@ ws at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been like him , &quot; would he never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting themes than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter , Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; it &apos;s not my president , &quot; she says . &quot;
and : &quot; the grapes are ripe even without pres@@ idents Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; Wend@@ els &apos;s film , for which Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12 000 cinem@@ ago@@ ers , also in the USA the interest aw@@ akes . &quot;
the Upper Bavarian congregation Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first mountain climbing village .
&quot; the 1800 inhabitants village in Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park received the award for soft tourism from the vice @-@ president &apos;s hand at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g . &quot;
there are already 20 &quot; mountain climbing villages in Austria . &quot;
&quot; in neighbouring countries , the Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award . &quot;
a &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants .
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as protection zone .
&quot; seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise dominates the reviews , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at Today Show &quot;
&quot; Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son ha@@ sten to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report afterwards to the loss of leadership of the Liber@@ als , but there has been no major shifts in reviews for Today . &quot;
the breakfast show of N@@ ine was broadcast by the German capital when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed to overthrow Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
&quot; the rival Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ days , was a part of a week @-@ long series of international television broad@@ casts to which Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n belonged . &quot;
&quot; this down@@ side of the board seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers , as Sun@@ rise achieved an average of 39@@ 7@@ ,000 spectators at the five main cities compared to today &apos;s 33@@ 9.@@ 000 . &quot;
&quot; today , Today , a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; today , in recent months , Today , the vulner@@ ability to Sun@@ rise has closed . &quot;
&quot; in August , Today , Today 3@@ 18@@ ,000 reached 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 33@@ 0.000 of Sun@@ rise . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000 . &quot;
&quot; so far in September , sunrise with an average of 34@@ 9.@@ 000 viewers at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today . &quot;

the grand novel@@ ty for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former ser@@ endi@@ ary of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ter Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father , who decides to settle with his two children along the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive figure of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers . &quot;
critics have wondered whether Thom@@ son had a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ney star Rebe@@ cca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; yes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the X Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers , and hit The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ 000 ) . &quot;
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , hosted by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe in average flow@@ ed to 44@@ 6,000 spectators . &quot;
&quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jumped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia recorded 5@@ 20,000 spectators and a total of 7@@ 20,000 in the second half hour . &quot;
average hot @-@ sea average 6@@ 20.000 .
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that hot @-@ se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 o &apos;clock .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a substitute for a million dollars that didn &apos;t manage to over@@ run the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Show .

the last three match : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
mystery revealed ? ...
&quot; L@@ ana E@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably have un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly obviously who The Bachelor wins . &quot;
&quot; the woman , at whom Sam Wood has finally landed in The Bachelor , was covered in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
&quot; but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows on the day before coming out of three two , you might accidentally have given a hint on who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood continues his lips down to the final on Thursday
&quot; all three women have expressed themselves in a ly@@ rical way why Wood is the perfect man and in doing so called his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; could be their answers to the game corruption , who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors . &quot;
each Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki quickly named both - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from day one .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and noticed energy ( Sarah &apos;s ) and S@@ ams energies , I felt they were quite compatible and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; &quot; said Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple .
&quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house visit made it clear last week that Wood was &quot; the One . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this was obviously not just a game - I am now att@@ un@@ ed to him , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked , W@@ ho@@ m should choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zzling . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
&quot; the Bachelor is broad@@ cast@@ ed to Ten on Wednesday , 7 : 30 PM . &quot;
originally released as Sarah first choice for Sam Wood ?
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL &apos;s career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams that sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some coaches had ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the bench when he lost a don@@ ki as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League conver@@ sions at his first Pun@@ t Return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity for a pun@@ t return and also in the running game after an injury of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a still showed his true face in the locker room after the game .
&quot; instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team through the mill , he encouraged them . &quot;
Tom@@ sul@@ a also publicly strengthened Hay@@ ne during his press conference after the match .
&quot; the 49@@ ers sports re@@ porter cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special teams coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his delayed catch and to take care of the next game . &quot;
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a Pun@@ t restored in the first quarter of the min@@ nes@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start to Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian followers for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the f@@ um@@ ble and later told Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine any worse start into his N@@ FL &apos;s career .
&quot; that was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; Hay@@ ne said . &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the car@@ ver with his original debut in 2007 when a pass took place in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
&quot; overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;

the free elec@@ torate calls for the hi@@ ring of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high refugee numbers .
&quot; at the beginning of the F@@ W Aut@@ umn Chamber in Groß@@ glo@@ stadt , party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned against a serious crisis at Bavaria &apos;s schools , if there are not enough new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to save the schools from collapse , &quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger said . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , we will get clu@@ es in the Bavarian education system . &quot;
the Free Di@@ pper &apos;s state parliament conven@@ es until Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian commun@@ e .
&quot; actually , completely different main themes were planned . &quot;
but the record number of refugees is now also domin@@ ating the free vot@@ er meeting .
&quot; of course , the subject of asylum will over@@ lay the retreat , &quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger said . &quot;
&quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of United Nations protection zones for refugees in Syria , as was the case during the wars in Yugoslavia in the 1990s . &quot;
&quot; so it &apos;s not going to go further , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; said the free vot@@ er boss . &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to push open voters as soon as possible .
&quot; that is why Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum claim : &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum judges , &quot; &quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger said . &quot;
the F@@ W chief critici@@ zed that several federal states were not consistent : &quot; we needed feder@@ ally uniform standards in the federal states . &quot;
&quot; Bavarian p@@ ushes away , others don &apos;t . &quot;
&quot; we need to become more efficient . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the regional policy in Groß@@ glo@@ stadt should not fall under the table .
a long @-@ standing torch remains on the agenda : education policy .
&quot; for the new school year , Ministry Minister Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot study &quot; &quot; middle level plus &quot; &quot; at 47 grammar schools in which an extension of the gym@@ nasi@@ um middle school was tested for three to four years . &quot;
but Ai@@ wan@@ ger doesn &apos;t go far enough .
&quot; the topic of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot;
we demand freedom of choice for all gym@@ nasi@@ ums that want it .
free travel at G@@ 9 wherever you want .
stronger Wall Street helps Da@@ x jumps on the jumps
the German stock market has closed with profits after a wide range of direction @-@ free and nervous trading .
&quot; only in the afternoon , a fir@@ mer pr@@ elu@@ de to the US stock exchanges was a clear direction , which ultimately promoted the Da@@ x by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8,@@ 13 points upward . &quot;
the M@@ DA@@ X medium @-@ sized values gained 0.@@ 54 percent to 19 55@@ 2.@@ 88 points .
the technology @-@ elastic Tec@@ Da@@ x rose by 1.@@ 03 percent to 17@@ 3@@ 6.@@ 69 points .
the euro Sto@@ xx 50 as the euro@@ zone &apos;s leading index decreased by 1.@@ 01 percent to 3@@ 20@@ 7.@@ 60 points .
solid profits also made public squares in London and Paris .
&quot; in the US , the Dow Jones Index reported last about 1 percent in Plus . &quot;
&quot; many stock markets expect the markets to enter the markets right up to the interest rate decision in the US , and also to a large decline in fut@@ ures trading on this Friday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , RW@@ E &apos;s shares were pushed to a record low and left deep marks on E@@ on . &quot;
&quot; according to &quot; Spiegel , &quot; German energy companies might be missing € 30 billion in provisions . &quot;
the German government denied the figures mentioned in the press .
&quot; ther@@ eu@@ pon , the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered slightly , but in the end always lost 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) . &quot;
&quot; at the Da@@ x Group , Infin@@ eon shares increased by a further 3.@@ 22 percent . &quot;
&quot; according to a dealer , a positive report from the US investor magazine &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; appeared from the weekend . &quot;
&quot; according to this , the German chip@@ maker currently has too little attention . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , investments in future @-@ oriented waf@@ er technologies and the focus on the car market should pay off . &quot;
&quot; car values were in demand : even in the traditionally weak summer months of August more cars were sold again than in the same period of the previous year , as the industry association AC@@ EA announced at the start of the International Motor Show IA@@ A in Frankfurt . &quot;
the papers from the Daimler and BMW car manufacturers increased by 1.@@ 34 percent and 2.@@ 21 percent respectively .
Volkswagen assets increased by 1.@@ 26 percent .
&quot; at the German pension market , the return on exchange of listed federal securities fell to 0.@@ 48 ( Friday : 0.@@ 50 ) percent . &quot;
the purchase price of Rex increased by 0.@@ 12 percent to 13@@ 9.@@ 55 points .
the federal government lost 0.@@ 71 percent to 15@@ 4.@@ 11 points .
&quot; in the afternoon , the exchange rate dropped to 1,@@ 12@@ 62 dollars in the afternoon . &quot;
&quot; against mid@@ day , the European Central Bank had set the reference rate to US $ 1.@@ 13@@ 05 ( 1.@@ 12@@ 68 ) . &quot;

4 people killed after police shoot rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
&quot; four people , among them a 4 year old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber bul@@ lets in a crowd that prot@@ ested against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district of Rup@@ an@@ deh@@ i , about 175 miles west of the capital city of Kathmandu . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , Deputy District Administrator , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station , and some of them threw stones and fire@@ bombs . &quot;
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police used tear gas and then shot them in the air before resor@@ ting to rubber bul@@ lets .
&quot; 20 police officers and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the used rubber bul@@ lets , known to them that they can kill , but are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal , where members of the Mad@@ mo@@ dest@@ i ethnic group say that new provinces , formed within the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in Western Nepal from the ethnic group of the T@@ har@@ us who want their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent clas@@ hes since the 10th century . &quot;

&quot; the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legis@@ lators accelerated the process following the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; the legis@@ lators have voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu , and officials have said that the new constitution might come into force on Sunday . &quot;
construction site planned in the city
the property at the Em@@ der Youth Centre Alte Post is to be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 @-@ square @-@ square @-@ area .
&quot; a mixture of trade , commerce and housing is planned - but there are no specific offers yet . &quot;
Em@@ den - Em@@ den wants to market an area around 4000 square meters in direct proximity to the youth centre of Alte Post .
preparations for this are currently underway .
&quot; the plan is to use the terrain for a mixture of trade , commerce and housing . &quot;
&quot; if you wait for appropriate offers , it is said on the part of the city . &quot;
which investor comes into question is not yet clear .
&quot; accordingly , no contracts have been concluded . &quot;
&quot; the city of Em@@ den had bought a part of the property , which is located on the Ring@@ straße / Corner Belt , already a few months ago and the building can be torn down . &quot;
project H@@ ieve : details lying on the table
the plans for the holiday settlement on the Small Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor drew publicly plans for the project for the first time .
several residents are still worried - they worry about selling their leisure activities
&quot; months had been behind closed doors , gre@@ ased , deb@@ ated and drawn . &quot;
now there are plans for a new holiday settlement on the small sea near Em@@ den on the table .
&quot; the Inter@@ est , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ der company &quot; System Building , &quot; presented his plans for the first time on Monday evening in the Council of the Council of the Council of the Council of the Council of the Council . &quot;
&quot; originally , this point had stood on the non @-@ public part of the order of the day . &quot;
&quot; under pressure from the project critic and the F@@ DP faction , who accused the investor and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ asing ran from the system construction management to the offensive : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said in front of the Council members and more than 50 visitors . &quot;
but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ours now .
the roughly ten to twelve million euro project has been in discussion for months .
&quot; fierce reactions among marine land@@ lords , who came to the meeting , called out the pictures and new details about the desired hotel building . &quot;
&quot; Roberto Schulz , owner of the sea and board member at the interests of the winners , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; &quot; this will be a giant block that over@@ looks all the other buildings . &quot;
&quot; he also fears like a number of other project critics that traffic would increase sharply due to the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; whole bus loads must come so that it pays off &quot; , &quot; says Schulz &quot;
&quot; what is happening on the well one hect@@ are area of the former restaurant , however , is still open . &quot;
there is no operator yet .
&quot; first we must have a coherent concept , &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ asing . &quot;
&quot; because this was still missing , the development plans are still variable . &quot;

Google launches campaign to raise $ 11 million for refugees
&quot; Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a dou@@ bling don@@ ate campaign to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees rolling over the European nations , as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries . &quot;
Google has an unusual personal approach to announ@@ cing the call for donations on his blog .
&quot; instead of making a manager the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who had fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; our trip included many dark railroad and bus journeys , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help . &quot;
&quot; donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing aid to refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
Google said that the first global donations will double up to $ 5.5 million to goo@@ gle@@ .com / En@@ er@@ eli@@ ef to $ 11 million .
&quot; Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year . &quot;
&quot; many of them escaped from war torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya . &quot;

weight loss surgery may be helpful for overweight diabe@@ tics .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether obes@@ e obes@@ e people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial on the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery . &quot;
weight loss surgery or obesity @-@ surgery use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
&quot; over the years obesity treatments for type 2 diabetes have proved efficient , but most studies have been carried out in people who are obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a measure of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study the researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ ese Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c ul@@ cers - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
&quot; the average BM@@ I , among those undergoing this operation , dropped from 31 to 24.@@ 5 by the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , BM@@ I remained among those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately at 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who underwent a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus disappeared completely and in 28 % partially . &quot;
&quot; in the medi@@ cally treated group , diabetes was completely dissolved in one percent and in part in only about two percent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results were better in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , the authors found out . &quot;
the researchers also monitored hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c &apos;s blood glucose levels which reflect the blood sugar levels over time .
&quot; ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , the researchers write . &quot;
&quot; after the operation , the mean hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mortality in five years , according to the senior researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also compared the average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the host rec@@ tomy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved larger decl@@ ines in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 % ) and reported a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study does not show the survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of more serious people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
in the Swedish study it was about 29 percent less likely to die in obes@@ e people who underwent O@@ bes@@ ity surgery in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
&quot; although the new study showed no benefit to survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it is soothing for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start weight seriously as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic modifications , which have attached their bodies to obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot;
love story takes place in the H@@ uns@@ rück
&quot; it is a topic that is increasingly being noticed in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular and un@@ si@@ ghtly at school times , meets the flock of her youth after years , and this falls in love with her . &quot;
so also in the recently published novel &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der .
&quot; beyond the love story , the novel is particularly interesting for H@@ uns@@ rück @-@ readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages . &quot;
the full @-@ time author grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she could set up a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot;
&quot; Europe cannot accept all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East is lying . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader urged to end violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford which dedic@@ ates itself to ethics studies .
he demanded that under certain circumstances the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama tou@@ red Germany &apos;s and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he emphasized that it was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime , you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as real peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; he stressed . &quot;
&quot; in the end , we have to think about how the killing will be reduced in their countries . &quot;
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of violence has never resolved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the issue of violence and also commented on George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of 11 September and revealed that the violent response of the United States drew a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he used force , and this caused unexpected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
four@@ fold increase in the intake of disinf@@ ect@@ ant by children over the past 4 years
&quot; poison control centres in the USA report an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years of age , with strong alcoholic hand dis@@ infection products , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of disinf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years of age , the poison control centres reported , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children increasingly come to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them lands in the emergency room , &quot; Lop@@ ez CN@@ N said . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children drink dis@@ infection products intentionally , while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mutation in social media . &quot;
videos on YouTube show how teenagers can drink dis@@ infection products only because of a cheap experience .
adolescents are said to have mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol containing mou@@ th@@ wash in order to get a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child doesn &apos;t think this is bad for it , &quot; Lop@@ ez said . &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand dis@@ infection products ) are those who are perf@@ um@@ ed .
&quot; there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange scent that are very appealing to children . &quot;
hand dis@@ infection products contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
&quot; especially in small children , few sp@@ lashes can lead to alcohol intoxic@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison control center at the Hospital of the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 transmitter in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t let any si@@ p whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand dis@@ infection in range of children , and when children come to it , then it is a quick way to consume lots of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently had four sp@@ lashes aged by straw@@ berry fragran@@ ta disinf@@ ect@@ ant in school , was taken into an emergency room . &quot;
&quot; her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold that is legally considered to be drunk by an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency medical doctor who treated her at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah sl@@ ammed her words and wasn &apos;t able to go when they arrived in the emergency room .
&quot; doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital for signs of brain trauma , as the girl had fallen by the alcohol and had turned his head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey . &quot;
&quot; this was very sc@@ ary , &quot; &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or disinf@@ ect@@ ant and store hand dis@@ infection agents outside the child &apos;s reach .
&quot; in addition to alcohol intoxic@@ ation , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after the swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ect@@ ants which contained a toxic , un@@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; health authorities staff suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a le@@ thal solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as an active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January three students of the fourth class , in the state of New York , planned to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by laying out anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished them from their room .
the police regarded the tar@@ n@@ ished plan as &quot; g@@ ossi@@ p &quot; and rejected disciplinary measures to the school authority .
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged
&quot; in case of a collision at the cross braces between Nordr@@ ing and on Her@@ mes , a 33 @-@ year @-@ old driver has been slightly injured in a rear @-@ end collision . &quot;
a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver drove to the direction of the round@@ about in the direction of the round@@ about and noticed too late that two vehicles ahead of the round@@ about had stopped .
&quot; as a result , he crashed into the rear of an audience with his truck and pushed this vehicle to a Ford Fi@@ esta . &quot;
&quot; the accident involving cars was caused by property damage of about 10,000 euros , inform@@ ing the police . &quot;
the Audi of the 33 @-@ year @-@ old was no longer prepared and had to be tow@@ ed .

&quot; I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think that players are looking forward to it . &quot;
the lack of title competition in Scottish football bored Nieder@@ sachsen - de Bo@@ er
former R@@ angers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans lost interest in Celtic Cafe because there is no title rival@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
&quot; at present , de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; in Holland , they show no highlights of Celtic games and why ? &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here talk not only about the return of the R@@ angers .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what interests them .
&quot; there is a lot of tension in the Old Fir@@ m games , and there are not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games . &quot;
&quot; I will turn things around , he swe@@ ars Dei@@ la . &quot;
&quot; Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la accepted that Celtic must fight , but the Norwegian chief s@@ wore to turn things around . &quot;
&quot; after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent ex@@ cre@@ tion from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ men from Aber@@ deen was defeated , which now with five points lead clearly to the top of the table . &quot;
&quot; Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; Celtic already had bad times before and we &apos;ll come back . &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happened . &quot;
we feel that exactly this way - but we have to go on .
&quot; we really need support from Celtic , because that makes the players better . &quot;
coming together is so important .

&quot; the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot;
players coming in the summer have this pre @-@ season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .

&quot; unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the UK it increases overall . &quot;
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 in May until July , while the number of people without labor for the UK as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was over that of the U@@ K@@ s of 5.5 percent , as shown by the numbers of the National Statisti@@ cal Office ( ON@@ S ) . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12.@@ 000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12.@@ 000 . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan has laid the foundations for a stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost exactly a year that Scotland has made the historic decision to remain a part of the United Kingdom .

why I Bec@@ ome a Wit@@ ness of an Occup@@ ation in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
&quot; a little later , except for a late legal intervention , I shall see how a man is brought to death . &quot;
&quot; if it happens and I hope that it won &apos;t happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the chamber of death in the Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison inj@@ ector . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death .
&quot; the invitation came for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; when the day drew near , I began to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the USA , and since there are often more applications available than seats , a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery takes place in order to decide who is elected . &quot;
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
those who are selected will observe it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ sy &apos;s closest friend with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so I won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pencil to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality on Twitter .
here is the lesson .
tell the prisoner &apos;s story how he wants it and you get access .
I am compla@@ ining with her .
&quot; she admitted that she &quot; &quot; could have better phr@@ ased it &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot;
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to be present to write there .
&quot; when he dies , he thinks that public relations work against the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ as , a re@@ porter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts I have made . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go into all details again .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ sy is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of the deed .
but I believe there is a strong lik@@ el@@ ihood that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I think his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him die .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters you can turn to .
what you get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death .

&quot; he stood in the water and said &apos; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; said senior ser@@ ge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman negoti@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
Championship soccer player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 C@@ ous@@ ins drove his car in the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim across the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspired locals to the hum@@ orous planning of Ben C@@ ous@@ ins @-@ Bi@@ athlon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards are trying to spy on him and threaten to end the race
&quot; Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year , threatening to finish the race immediately . &quot;
&quot; he aimed at the ste@@ wards and the Racing Victoria &apos;s integrity department , claiming that they carried out a personal campaign against him with the late S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; M@@ oo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for racing , and he found himself under difficult conditions when it comes to the positive Kob@@ alt @-@ T@@ up@@ shot at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain . &quot;
he had with@@ held 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age repro@@ aches and did not want it to &quot; look like too high @-@ hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out suddenly , &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot;
they know that it went on .
sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences and I have to live with what I have said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk around my head and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
&quot; if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a coach . &quot;
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously M@@ oo@@ dy had let the bomb go up in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable .
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago , Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I am going to name when asked - and offered him an occupation in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; M@@ oo@@ dy said on Rac@@ ing@@ .@@ com. &quot;
they obviously believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
&quot; if that is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses , because they failed in trying to touch me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard K@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of the time and are still today . &quot;
should this bring me to the point that it will be personally ?
does the R@@ V@@ L behave cow@@ ard@@ ly and perhaps makes people outside of trainers responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people are thinking out there that I am .
&quot; maybe they have to take my license and viol@@ ate me , and I have no doubt that what I say is now about to think about it . &quot;
&quot; but now I &apos;ve arrived at the point that doesn &apos;t matter to me , and that makes me sad . &quot;
that really makes me sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and urge them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the trainer &apos;s frustr@@ ations have built up with the long @-@ lasting cobal@@ t examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led to the fact that he said he could &quot; &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot;
&quot; M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by his preparation for the unbe@@ ar@@ able Master Black Ca@@ vi@@ ar , described the race day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse &apos;s feet , which viol@@ ated the rules . &quot;
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my co @-@ workers has mistakenly put mud on the leg .
it would have been so last night .
it would have been possible all day long what was so .
but it had also been so on the race day .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the package on the race day . an investigation of this issue was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot;
man after flight cur@@ ses arrested
&quot; on the weekend , the police arrested a man after a collision with a cycl@@ ist and subsequent driver cur@@ ses in Cob@@ ram . &quot;
the cycl@@ ist was delivered with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Mur@@ ray Valley Highway .
the police said the driver continued driving without stopping to help the injured rider .
&quot; on Monday , a 50 @-@ year @-@ old man from N@@ ath@@ alia joined the police in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on . &quot;
he is expected to be charged with driver cur@@ ses and assistance in providing assistance and other traffic off@@ ences .
&quot; the cycl@@ ist , a 40 @-@ year @-@ old guy from Cob@@ ram , remains in the hospital . he is in a stable state . &quot;
Melbourne storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy back against rival for claims to ring fighting
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has described criticism of the Tac@@ kl@@ ing of his players as &quot; Agenda setting &quot; by two Premier League favour@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the ump@@ ires were allowed the storm players &quot; ring battles &quot; with his team during the high Storm &apos;s victory in the qualifying fin@@ als in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ co trainer Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett made an almost disgu@@ ised note to the Storm team after his team scored the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; model example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land are not &quot; too good &quot; in w@@ rest@@ ling .
&quot; Bell@@ amy defended the squ@@ ir@@ t of his crew and said that , at the Tac@@ kl@@ ing , they were only focused on their &quot; contact . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition , Bell@@ amy added that the review of two leading trainers at his team was confident that she was worried that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team . &quot;
&quot; this always appears again - I did not hear Tr@@ ent Robinson said about ring fighting when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that we have not changed anything from our defensive system or techniques throughout the year , but over the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ tile for a real focus , and that has provided us with the turn@@ around . &quot;
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years and he obviously has a great team to train . he is probably not accustomed to losing so it was a bit of a shock for him .
it &apos;s strange to see this again and again at this time of the year .
&quot; Bell@@ amy attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football , &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that Benn@@ ett &apos;s St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football . &quot;
Wa@@ yne is talking about exciting football .
&quot; he compared his play on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said he will take care of a bull@@ fight . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and which we see as exciting , especially his young players at their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his kind of football to play - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play like them . &quot;
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about the Big Games .
&quot; Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm versus R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos , against cow@@ boys . &quot;
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game , but is it an exciting game ? &quot;
or are breaks and no points something exciting ?
for me it is the game boards .
&quot; if they mention us , it means that we will meet them in one phase . &quot;
the Storm team is free on this weekend because they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks next Saturday night in the semi @-@ fin@@ als at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
&quot; $ 200,000 Guarant@@ ee on Dru@@ gs &quot;
&quot; a man who could potentially face a life sentence because of his attempt to come into possession of 40 kil@@ os of co@@ ca@@ ine smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land was released against a $ 200,000 deposit . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and started in August in Co@@ om@@ era . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants in the marina during the morning and later at the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo . &quot;
&quot; despite a potentially life sentence for attempting to possess a commercial deal of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that he tried to possess the entire amount and that in the café could have been a harmless reason . &quot;
&quot; the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was concerned about the risk of escape at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; he explained to the court on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in case of a criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as security in order to achieve his release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it statements of the two persons , it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; said judge Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot;
&quot; but that alone will not be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on b@@ ail , under the conditions that he ab@@ dic@@ ates his Australian and his Serbian passport , reports to the police daily and is holding a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 to 06 : 00 . &quot;
accident at A@@ 5 near Karlsruhe : cab tears apart
&quot; during a rear @-@ end collision with three trucks on the highway 5 near Karlsruhe , a truck driver had been seriously injured on Tuesday evening . &quot;
two of the three lor@@ ries involved had slow@@ ed down in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
&quot; the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to turn left at the last moment , as the police said . &quot;
the driver &apos;s cab of the crash culp@@ tor tear completely apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed for six hours until 2 o &apos;clock .
&quot; there was a damage in the amount of 12@@ 2,000 euros . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used telephone of girls to l@@ ure ped@@ ophil@@ es to sending images
a ped@@ ophi@@ le used the phone of an 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to demand pictures of child abuse .
&quot; St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the girl &apos;s phone when this slept , log into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a series of incomplete pictures of children sent to him by another user . &quot;
the girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Ho@@ gg .
she saw it and found the conf@@ using messages and immediately al@@ er@@ ted her mother .
&quot; the police took care of this and saw the five images , then analysed computers found under the address and found &quot; &quot; related &quot; &quot; web searches that were used to search for in@@ decent images of children . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ gg then claimed to the officials that he did it , as it would lead to &quot; ped@@ ophi@@ lia on the internet , &quot; and then &quot; preten@@ ding to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; he said it would be an addiction - that he is hoo@@ ked to frigh@@ ten people . &quot;
&quot; he admitted that the searches on the computer were carried out by him , but said it happened because he wanted to claim to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are ped@@ ophil@@ es . &quot;
&quot; after his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures , he asked him to send even more photos . &quot;
he said he did it to l@@ ure her .
&quot; he said he was ill in his head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder . &quot;
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was trem@@ bling and crying .
she then saw the in@@ decent images on the phone and confronted the accused with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said the accused took advantage of computer and pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he was .
&quot; Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to the In@@ dict@@ ment of having admitted un@@ decent images of children on 14 June last year and did not appear before the court for a hearing on March 24 of this year . &quot;
&quot; defense lawyer Gregor S@@ im asked that Ho@@ gg would not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , as one could argue that &quot; &quot; no considerable sexual element &quot; &quot; could be found in his off@@ ence . &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ cha@@ el postpon@@ ed the sentence until October to get background reports on social work .
&quot; Ho@@ gg was granted a deposit in this case , but was kept in custody for hear@@ ings to other pending cases . &quot;
he was added before the date of the sentence into the list of sexual off@@ ences .
Schle@@ users switch to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are being taken away from the large @-@ scale control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers left people on smaller border cross@@ ings due to fear of discovery and arrest .
&quot; on the Austrian side , a spokesman for the Federal Police said . &quot;
more than 1000 refugees have been taken up in the Land@@ kreise of Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn since Tuesday .
they reached the German side by foot over bridges and but@@ chers .
&quot; there , they are received by the Federal Police and forwarded to the registration . &quot;
&quot; compared to the weekly opening of the week on Wednesday , the Munich Central Station met again clearly more refugees . &quot;
&quot; around 700 people arrived in the state capital alone until 8 : 00 a.m. , said a speaker in the morning . &quot;
&quot; after the re @-@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border on Tuesday , 17@@ 59 refugees reached the city . &quot;
&quot; Stuttgart : prec@@ urs@@ ors of tropical storm &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; expected in the Sou@@ thwest &quot;
meteor@@ ologists warn of storms in the south @-@ west of Wednesday afternoon .
&quot; due to a low pressure area in Western Europe , hot sea air is currently being chann@@ elled into the country , announced the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart . &quot;
&quot; the strong depression is the prec@@ ursor of the tropical storm &quot; Henry , &quot; which was drawn from the Bermuda Islands via the Atlantic in the past few days . &quot;
violent storms and thunder@@ storms are expected in Baden .
&quot; according to DW@@ D , even in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the Boden@@ seek@@ er , DW@@ D is to be reck@@ oned with gu@@ sts from 60 to 90 kilometers per hour . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the sun is shining again . &quot;
the crowd makes it : every two years free@@ ways show their innovations at the IA@@ A .
&quot; 2015 is particularly popular with the compact cars , which are currently particularly well @-@ selling . &quot;
&quot; Rüssel@@ sheim . automobil@@ es from the compact class are particularly popular : around 28@@ ,@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations were accounted for by the German Motor Show ( KBA ) alone in August alone . &quot;
this is also reflected at the IA@@ A ( public holidays 17 to 27 September ) .
&quot; this year , many new compact models will be introduced between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars . &quot;
&quot; Rüssel@@ sheim . one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German automobile industry is the Opel Astra , which will stand by dealers in autumn . &quot;
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Rüssel@@ sheim / Frankfurt . Opel is offering a footh@@ old below the largest competitor , VW Golf , with a total of 17,@@ 650 euros . &quot;
the current Astra will cost from 16@@ 9@@ 90 Euro .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , the Hessen also offers further diesel and gasoline engines ranging from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for which three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines can be counted for the first time . &quot;
&quot; unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is now just five @-@ door . &quot;
&quot; the second variant will follow in the spring of the Com@@ bi , which is also visible at the IA@@ A . &quot;
and what will be added to new compact cars in addition to the Astra at the IA@@ A ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra @-@ competitor Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
&quot; at the trade fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is to be seen exclusively as a five @-@ door in a conventional and a distinc@@ tively sporty GT version . &quot;
&quot; he comes to trade at the beginning of next year , then as a comb@@ i . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan branch wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
&quot; with its curved lines , the compact Infin@@ iti transforms itself into the brand &apos;s design line . &quot;
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
&quot; in the offer , there is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp . &quot;
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno who celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
&quot; the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 PS . &quot;
&quot; according to the manufacturer &apos;s specifications , the maximum torque is 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) . &quot;
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
&quot; Ds 4 : not quite new , but completely renewed is the compact class DS 4 , which can be seen at the IA@@ A . &quot;
&quot; on the outside , the designer of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n radiator touched the front . here the radiator shell was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights were equipped with LED technology . &quot;
&quot; in the interior , the inf@@ otain@@ ment system was modernis@@ ed , reducing the number of buttons by a touch screen , and integrating Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play for the first time . &quot;
&quot; in addition , at the IA@@ A in the compact class , there are a number of re@@ visions and new variants , such as the Mercedes A @-@ Class , or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI . &quot;
J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are un@@ worthy
&quot; the Federal Constitutional Court has given right to an ex @-@ prisoner of the German judicial exec@@ utor , Te@@ gel , who was lod@@ ged in a small cell for months . &quot;
&quot; because of the violation of their dignity , prisoners are entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells . &quot;
this decision was made by the Federal Constitutional Court in an order published on Wednesday .
&quot; according to the judges , the persons affected can even hope for money if they were confined in confined spaces only a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was housed in the Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary facility between June and November 2009 in a single cell with approximately five square meters of floor space ; the toilet was not separated spati@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man , who , according to his lawyer , was now on the open foot , was moved to a larger cell . &quot;
his arrest warrant because of the un@@ di@@ gni@@ fied detention conditions against the Land of Berlin failed .
&quot; however , the Constitutional Ju@@ dges raised the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ als and rejected the case for re@@ examination . &quot;
they see the man &apos;s dignity hurt .
court of Appe@@ al decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; even if for legal reasons only a few days of adher@@ ence to the compensation were decisive for the compensation , there was an equ@@ ation , it was called . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; wor@@ rying the legal protection of the personality would be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber of Appe@@ al now has to clarify the amount of cash compensation .
&quot; in the past , the constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of law . &quot;
&quot; thus , only in April they said to a prisoner of in@@ dem@@ n@@ ity because he was locked in a cell naked . &quot;
&quot; according to a decision from 2011 , the multiple allocation of a cell with no separate toilet is un@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had agreed on a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 . &quot;
&quot; over three months , the pla@@ inti@@ ff was lod@@ ged between 15 and 21 hours a day in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case . &quot;
&quot; over the past few weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons have also hit the head@@ lines because of missing personnel . &quot;
&quot; deta@@ inees will therefore always be included in 23 hours of aggres@@ si@@ veness , even to fights , because of the ten@@ se situation . &quot;
&quot; according to the Ministry of Justice , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of the lack of young talent , 19 will fall away in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; we are creating this &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept her .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; approximately 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year according to forecasts by the Federal Ministry of the Interior , according to Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to host a million refugees . &quot;
&quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do that and we can do that . &quot;
the following overview con@@ veys what is added to Germany .
&quot; according to various progn@@ oses between 350@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry of Finance ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) , flats are used annually - and for the next five years . &quot;
this is almost twice as much as built up until now ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
&quot; the lack of living space is dramatic but above all with affordable rental properties : every year , 60@@ ,000 to 80@@ ,000 social housing from the rental price link are published , and refugees will also apply for these particularly favorable apartments . &quot;
&quot; Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; this is far too little from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing needs to be created each year , and the federal government would have to invest EUR 6.@@ 4 billion a year . &quot;
&quot; in agreement , scientists and the Federal Ministry of Agriculture agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in residential construction . &quot;
&quot; according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , it is assumed that 55 per cent of the poultry in Germany can be employed in the long term . &quot;
&quot; however , the refugees in Germany would not be systematically sought after their qualifications to help them get started , critic@@ ising Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education at the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot;
but for the integration of refugees is crucial if they find work in Germany .
&quot; work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the support society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , there has been a political turn@@ around in Germany : from a ban on employment for refugees to recognise work . &quot;
&quot; whereas previously there was a prohibition of working for asylum seekers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , just as the residence requirement that asylum seekers are limited to a place of residence . &quot;
&quot; in society , even because of the shortage of skilled labour , the view has prevailed - in many ways that refugees should be able to quickly gain access to the labour market . &quot;
a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is lack of knowledge of German .
&quot; to date , there is no adequate supply of general and professional language courses . &quot;
studies also show that jobs are most often medi@@ ated through personal contacts .
&quot; for this reason , the construction of networks is the royal road to work integration , according to the opinion of Thr@@ än@@ men . &quot;
&quot; the Berlin school administration has established that only a few escaped parents give their children to the Kit@@ as , approximately 10 to 15 percent : &quot; for the dis@@ car@@ ded parents , it is only once again important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ zy@@ bar , spokesperson for youth and family at the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the management distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages . &quot;
&quot; if the need for educ@@ ators is increasing considerably due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase its training capacity - for instance by allowing more specialised schools . &quot;
&quot; in the countries , students without German language skills are prepared for tuition in the form of welcome classes . &quot;
&quot; however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ ones from the Berlin school administration . &quot;
the Deutscher Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany .
&quot; in principle , no federal state forbi@@ ds asylum seekers or tolerated studying - the only exception to date was Berlin , interior radiator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned its attitude . &quot;
studi@@ ous refugees could be facilit@@ ated access to the university .
&quot; because refugees with a residence permit or ac@@ qui@@ escence do not receive any services after the asylum seek@@ er performance law , if they start studying . &quot;
&quot; in principle , the latter do not receive a b@@ af@@ e , since they do not fall under the circle of the b@@ af@@ e persons . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , tolerated refugees had to have been living in Germany for four years to be B@@ af@@ o@@ g . from January 1 , 2016 , this span has been reduced to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; however , this financing gap must also be closed , for Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s Secretary of State for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk . &quot;
the students should immediately get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
&quot; Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should succ@@ essively clean up the same rights as the churches have , and the existing state church law will continue to develop a new state @-@ of @-@ religion relationship . &quot;
the foundation of an Islamic welfare association devoted professionally to the newcom@@ ers would also be important .
duties also belong to the rights .
&quot; in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts and be willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and grant them certain control possibilities . &quot;
this also includes the willingness to take action against religious fundament@@ alism .
&quot; the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to prosec@@ ute such conflicts in Germany immediately &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot;
he proposed transl@@ ating the Basic Law in Arabic .
&quot; in the future , integration will be a topic of the whole society much more than today . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the majority society will also have to change and the reduction of discrimination and racism is more urgent . &quot;
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination area and a general equality law for a decade .
&quot; but it is very slow to learn how the NS@@ U murder series showed , in which police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; equal opportunities for all : what migrants &apos; organisations and the interest groups of non @-@ white Germans have long been calling for and what international agreements like the anti @-@ racism convention are committed to Germany , must become a reality in the coming years if the country is to remain peaceful and its new citizens should use its opportunities for the good of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany is in a position to provide medical assistance to the currently expected refugees , writes medical president Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; as for man@@ - power and capacities , we create that , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , additional money has to flow into the system for this . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery demands to hand out health cards to all the newcom@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; later , achievements could be settled by the federal states . &quot;
&quot; and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to scra@@ pe so many people with the limited catalogue of services that the law of asylum seekers faces . &quot;
&quot; apart from that , the doctors above all make the language barriers to create . &quot;
&quot; so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has demonstrated that immigrants are more poorly informed about their diseases than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , but also in medical practices , interpreting costs would have to be taken over . &quot;
but it would also have helped many refugees with more general medical centres in the emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic look .
&quot; among refugee children , for example , there are clearly more in@@ treated han@@ di@@ caps , and in young people it is about HIV @-@ raising . &quot;
&quot; but with some other illnesses , German doctors are coming from their training but clearly , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery means . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis is not so difficult to recognize . &quot; &quot; and as far as the doctors &apos; don@@ w@@ m is concerned , the refugees might even be allevi@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; the Syri@@ ans would have been a highly developed educational system , some refugees are even doctors . &quot;
&quot; in order to be allowed to practice , they must prove their qualifications and possibly take ex@@ ams . &quot;
&quot; according to estimates by the Federal psych@@ otherap@@ ist chamber ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) , at least half of refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill : most suffer from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression . &quot;
&quot; refugee children are particularly vulnerable , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , president of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recent study by the Technical University of Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee child is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
&quot; those who suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder , among other things , suffer from so @-@ called flash backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and death . &quot;
&quot; other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , severe fri@@ ght and emotional detach@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; to prevent the symptoms from chronic , early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z explained . &quot;
&quot; to date , however , only four percent of psych@@ ologically ill refugees receive psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; psych@@ ologically ill asylum seekers in the welfare offices can submit a request for psych@@ otherapy , however the treatment usually takes several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the welfare offices , cler@@ ks or doctors who are not trained for mental illness , decide whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; with the new production &quot; &quot; Passion &quot; , &quot; circus Pro@@ bst reaches back to the traditions of circus arts . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to attract any age group into the fascination of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment . &quot;
&quot; now , the circus Pro@@ bst looks into the man@@ ege on the tile &quot; &quot; W@@ aves to Dre@@ ams &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; our passion is the circus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my family , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , animal teacher and junior chef . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the current man@@ e@@ gen@@ staged presentation . &quot;
circus in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family for more than 33 years .
the gift to inspire lies with the family in the blood .
&quot; it is important for us to take the people away from their everyday routine and take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; emphasized the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with world city flair &quot; , &quot; says director Reinhard Pro@@ bst , his concept . &quot;
&quot; 50 cities on the almost 3,000 km long tour can now experience this flair . &quot;
the program of the circus convin@@ ces by talented artists from around the world .
&quot; awarded at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown family captiv@@ ates the audience with wit and charm . &quot;
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
&quot; with the heroes of silent films , the Cuban du@@ et likes to take up loos@@ ely . &quot;
light@@ ness and ag@@ ility - these words identify them .
her hum@@ orous art at the mast is supposed to conquer women &apos;s hearts in a storm .
&quot; apart from numerous salmon @-@ sal@@ ves , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst is also fascinated by intuition and ag@@ ility . &quot;
balance with the un@@ ic@@ ycle on a ball ?
no problem for He Yu@@ an .
snake @-@ men fascin@@ ate and start@@ le at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics like little others and fascin@@ ates with their mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; says Steph@@ anie &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
ab@@ norm@@ alities in cir@@ c@@ uses are all too often subject to different animal protection organizations .
Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst occupies the position : &quot; if it doesn &apos;t work well with our animals it doesn &apos;t work well either .
about 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each mat@@ ernity unit .
&quot; the &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists , &quot; as they are called aff@@ ection@@ ately , will be read by the eyes as much as possible . &quot;
we want to work with animals and have fun with them .
&quot; if the animal does not feel well , it does not want to go into the arena . &quot;
&quot; the first commandment , therefore , is good for the animals . &quot;
&quot; especially on her zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land@@ P@@ ony@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a Zeb@@ ra@@ stu@@ te , the Pro@@ bst family is proud . &quot;
the two animals lived in one enclosure for eight years and nothing happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little Jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; Brigitte Pro@@ bst comments . &quot;
&quot; the zeb@@ roid is not ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst . &quot;
there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or 1 200 spectators , we always do our best and are with all the heart . &quot;
circus Pro@@ bst looks forward to his performances daily from 17 to 20 September .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.@@ m .
&quot; Thursday is a family day , for the performance at 17 o &apos;clock the prices are reduced . &quot;
it is also open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.@@ m .
Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mu@@ gabe lives false speech in parliament
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , desc@@ ended from a podium in the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread across the social media . &quot;
the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by alle@@ gations made by members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address with Bu@@ hr@@ ufen as well .
&quot; last month , they had expelled him and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
the spokesman for the Movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones they warned against disturbing Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &quot; death &quot; , &quot; he said to journalists after Mu@@ gabe . &quot;
&quot; it warns the Parliament members concerned that immunity ends in parliament , and as soon as they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot;
&quot; the spokesman said that the party managed by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; &quot; concerned &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot;
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard to reduce up to 30.000 jobs
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to employ 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services . &quot;
&quot; later this year , HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and its service activities . &quot;
&quot; the expected job cuts will result in a burden of over $ 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , Vice @-@ President and Chief Executive , who will lead the unit after separation . &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise is smaller and more focused than HP is today , and we have a broad and diversified portfolio of businesses that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; says Whit@@ man . &quot;
as an independent company we are better positioned than ever before in order to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world .
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on providing previously un@@ paralleled , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; said the company &apos;s statement . &quot;
it spl@@ its a company which was founded in the 1930s by graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to produce electrical installations and their Pal@@ o Alto Garage one called &quot; the birth place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to manage the return from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this field based on the belief that tightly focused companies can perform better performance . &quot;
FC Arsenal @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates must stand behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb
&quot; Wen@@ ger pointed out to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September , and if his rehabilitation runs according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optimistic scenario means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England , and in the face of his story his participation in the next summer at the European Championship is certainly uncertain . &quot;
the big dis@@ grace in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury does not threaten the career , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it is a bone that did not heal well .
this is not a larger matter .
this was just an accident .
it did not stand in connection with his k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries that he had previously .
&quot; this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as little recognized , there is the associated danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the study of Premier Inj@@ uries Ltd has listed 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since its debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of the arsen@@ als in the last five seasons .
&quot; the broader picture for arsen@@ al is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 , which have recorded most of the hur@@ d@@ les . &quot;
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the vulner@@ ability rate will last during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , when you come back from an injury , you have a vulnerable time period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and win battle power , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al begins its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger is turning a rotation within the team . &quot;
&quot; H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , which means that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep balance and give players who need it to take a little break , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; although arsen@@ al &apos;s clear favor@@ ites are to continue by group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe . &quot;
&quot; Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games , after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign started in the last season . &quot;
&quot; the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday night , being measured on the Richter scale of 3.2 . &quot;
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; Wen@@ ger believes that arsen@@ al has pulled the lesson from last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation to Monaco , and is driven by far @-@ off hope to lead the club to his first Europ@@ ap@@ ok@@ al triumph with his management . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it has never worked with arsen@@ al .
&quot; we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers . &quot;
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the Com@@ edy @-@ Show which gave us serious lessons on male friend@@ ships
&quot; the absence of similar portra@@ y@@ als in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up , now more desperate than ever before , as self @-@ murder among young men on a 15 @-@ year @-@ high prove . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men between 20 and 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to address the problem , the Campa@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - Campa@@ ign Against a pi@@ tiful life ) 2015 announced as the year of the man to question the culture that prevents men from seeking help if they need them . &quot;
friendship is at the heart of the battle to tackle this challenge .
&quot; a recent study involving more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms stated that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery were doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems . &quot;
&quot; but of course you have to have friends , so that friendship can work . &quot;
&quot; in the age of communication guided through social media , with its emphasis on style over substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than an important contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even if the isolation predomin@@ ates in reality . &quot;
&quot; this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the cost of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our spiritual health much deeper . &quot;
&quot; and as a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy happiness . &quot;
the nice thing about friends was that this focus was put on the head .
&quot; each character was defined not by his work , but by his personality shining through the interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments at football pitch in cozy arm@@ chairs and the desire of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can relate to it , even if they often with@@ hold to fully explore their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as an employee of the telephone counsel@@ ing told me , ... &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and at risk of suicide has shown me clearly how even the smallest interactions between friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends .
&quot; the old phrase &quot; &quot; I come with it &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness , when talking about problems . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
&quot; as much as my objective out@@ sider status over the telephone may also help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so , if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest this weekend to celebrate the day completely re@@ designed scenery , why not take your friends for a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or , even better , when you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say hello . &quot;
you never know the difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the total 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ die Cav@@ ani after his hits against Malm@@ ö .
&quot; in his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday , di Maria helps PS@@ G to pass to Malm@@ ö . &quot;
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ die Cav@@ ani were on track when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ Park stadium on Tuesday .
&quot; in less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut , di Maria met as PS@@ G player who brought the French master to the road , but after that they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head @-@ ball in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Sha@@ k@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in the group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish master , as they not only asp@@ ire to qualify for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , it was not a classic game by Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs . he was later replaced in the game against his home town team and against the club with whom he began his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it is a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause problems to our opponents and to look back relaxed even if there are certain things we have to perfect over the season , &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; this is a good omen .
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we didn &apos;t achieve one or two more goals . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which held a 2 : 2 tie at his own place against Bordeaux in the First Division , but he was eliminated in the fourth minute by Di Maria . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ inian flu@@ gel@@ ist was said to be the man who could take PS@@ G to the next level in Europe , and he indicated why , when he passed into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense , before he passed Johan Wil@@ de in nicely to the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; however , if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malm@@ ö , who hit the Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this stage , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players in the field and was a serious competitor with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field . &quot;
&quot; but in addition to a shot of Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed away from Kevin Tra@@ pps Post in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in advance . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G himself sometimes gave himself up , with some fla@@ ws and bad degrees , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was p@@ atz@@ t in the first half alone and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used him after the re@@ boot . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he proved a lot more skill when he brought his te@@ amm@@ ers into the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which Di Maria turned into a shooting which was driven by Wil@@ de in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the post ... &quot;
&quot; the second gate finally collap@@ sed shortly after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an scored its sixth win , after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had found a lef@@ ti@@ ver flan@@ k by Max@@ well . &quot;
&quot; that ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could come back to the game , and only an excellent intervention from Wil@@ de to stop David Lu@@ iz could keep the final result low before replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi finished a gate at the end . &quot;
&quot; the trainer of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have only played in the Swedish league , which has not the same level . &quot;
the qualification games are not enough . &quot;
hats off to Paris !
it was a great game of them !
&quot; Gl@@ en@@ core collects 2.5 billion $ by share sales , &quot;
&quot; the Gl@@ en@@ core mining giant , which is based in Switzerland , which is affected by collap@@ sing raw material prices , gathered 2.5 billion $ by a stock sales as part of its huge school student plan . &quot;
&quot; the company Gl@@ en@@ core , registered in London , said in a statement that it sold new shares worth around CHF 1.6 billion to pay off its own debts . &quot;
&quot; the company , which lost 57 percent of its market value this year , is struggling with falling commodity prices as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn p@@ ushes demand and has a devastating effect on markets . &quot;
the issue of subscription rights brought gl@@ en@@ cores stock price performance at the early Wednesday morning a rapid rise to the top of London &apos;s stock market .
&quot; the share jumped by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 P@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 Index , which was 0.@@ 69 percent higher . &quot;
&quot; Gl@@ en@@ core had announced the 2.5 billion $ share sale last week as part of the more extensive plans , in order to rede@@ em some one @-@ third of its $ 30 billion debt . &quot;
&quot; the company sold the new shar@@ ehol@@ dings to 125 P@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday . &quot;
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the Group .
&quot; concerns regarding long @-@ term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other raw material prices declined by 20 to 40 percent . &quot;

the White House confirmed Xi Jin@@ ping &apos;s visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping will make a state visit to the USA at the end of the month and confirmed the White House in an explanation on Tuesday .
&quot; the visit , X@@ is &apos;s first official in Washington , will take place on September 25 and rep@@ lies President Barack Obama &apos;s trip to Beijing last November , said the statement . &quot;
the US President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ yu@@ an at a state d@@ iner this evening after the two leaders have bilateral talks .

&quot; XI , whose visit was initially announced in February , is expected to meet several US technology leaders in Seattle on their way to Washington before going to New York City at the UN General Assembly in September . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Obama and Xi can address a number of controversial issues , including Washington &apos;s concerns about the alleged cy@@ ber @-@ spi@@ on@@ age of China and its increasing self @-@ confidence in the disputed waters of the South China Sea . &quot;
&quot; 440 @-@ hp sports car , borrow@@ ed and driven into scrap &quot;
a 29 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to fulfill a dream and borrow@@ ed a Ford Mu@@ st@@ ang .
on the wet free@@ way then came the evil awakening .
&quot; at a company in the Got@@ ha County , one can fulfill the dream and once again rent a V8 US sports car Ford Mu@@ st@@ ang Boss 30@@ 2 with 440 b@@ hp . &quot;
so this was also a 29 @-@ year @-@ old from the district of Got@@ ha .
&quot; at the A 71 near Arn@@ stadt , the dream came out and over . &quot;
&quot; the 29 @-@ year @-@ old lost control of the sports car , fell into the spin on wet roads and drove to the guard rail . &quot;
&quot; the sports car suffered total damage , no one was injured . &quot;
&quot; the material damage is estimated at 40,000 EUR . &quot;
X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 switch to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
&quot; the FC Bayern was obviously a few years before the arrival of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who at that time played for FC Barcelona . &quot;
&quot; eight times Spanish champion , three times winner champion , four times champion league winner , twice champion league champion , twice World Champion , twice World Champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking . &quot;
&quot; in summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and joined the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar . &quot;
&quot; but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i now advises that he stood before the European Championship in 2008 before leaving Barcelona . &quot;
I told me that Bar@@ ça wants to sell me .
&quot; Madrid won everything back then , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; he says . &quot;
and that also registered FC Bayern .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; I wanted to have Rum@@ men@@ au . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over FC Bayern . &quot;
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this works today for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has signed Guardi@@ ola and I have played a great European . &quot;
&quot; PE@@ P told me that I would not change , that he could not imagine the crew without me . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s how he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ erns &apos;s season 2008 / 2009 had run with X@@ av@@ i .

matt Dam@@ on confronted the Af@@ ro @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said she was not needed behind the scenes .
&quot; during a series of Sunday Night held by HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown under@@ mined the need for alternative perspectives while referring to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project . &quot;
&quot; if we talk about diversity , do it with the cast of the film and not in the occupation of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot;
&quot; brown re@@ acted shocked , with ab@@ u@@ sive un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; as the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian gathered themselves . &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer colleagues Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I would like to invite people to think about - who will always be the director - how to deal with the character of Harmon@@ y , &quot; Brown said . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a ut@@ te beaten by her white p@@ im@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the producer of Dear White People set up for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for the film directing rights . Dam@@ on replied that their direction &quot; &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; after the discussion had been aired , the social media explo@@ ded before dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments . &quot;
Twitter user Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger about the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room so he can explain its diversity - that &apos;s SO K@@ NO@@ WS it hur@@ ts .
&quot; the twe@@ ets earned more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 list@@ ings since its publication . &quot;
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments arrive at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the head of social discussion .
&quot; when the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement achieved a national impact and urged legis@@ lators and authorities to stop discrimin@@ atory practices against coloured content . &quot;
&quot; in February , Prince Prince made a recording of the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards . &quot;
&quot; albums still matter , &quot; &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot;
&quot; like books and black life , albums still have their meaning . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter Movement have issued an explanation in response to the question of the Fox News personality , Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be considered a hate group . &quot;
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders . &quot;
&quot; recently , it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ ins invited to visit the pop@@ e to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is not clear .
&apos; American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crowns first champion
professional sport climbing and operating help Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athlete who won the American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; the competition show , which finished their 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who was able to complete all stages of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman , Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final . &quot;
&quot; for the last task , climbing was part of a climbing rope of 75 feet in 30 seconds . &quot;
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time with which he was the first athlete to finish the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or . however Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full three seconds faster which made him the winner .
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke to E ! news after the hard won victory , still under the shock of winning the Big Prize of $ 1 million . &quot;
&quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned or had more than $ 10,000 , &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot;
suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , won &apos;t receive any prize money . &quot;
&quot; according to the rules , money goes to the fastest person . &quot;
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; how much money is a wonderful price and life changes , it receives the great grat@@ u@@ ity . &quot;
I don &apos;t think he won any gru@@ dge .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , I &apos;m glad that Isaac is Isaac . &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt as if they had exchanged the roles .
America N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or has been extended for an eighth season ; the shooting will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
mint AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ H The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers are on the last place in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field on Tuesday . &quot;
the tw@@ ins wasted a chance to climb within one half of the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card slot .
&quot; for Detroit , even though only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word that was so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all wins make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; Tig@@ ers manager Brad Aus@@ mus said . &quot;
&quot; tiger Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon sustained his early offensive support , when Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck up 6 times in the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to finish this year , &quot; &quot; Simon said . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to throw each game in the bull@@ pen , and therefore I want to go completely concentrated in the game . &quot;
&quot; the designated tiger @-@ h@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two ranks , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August . &quot;
it was the first three @-@ se@@ ater game by Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle Navy on 6 July .
&quot; he has sw@@ ung the sle@@ e@@ ol@@ z well , &quot; &quot; said Aus@@ cock . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at the ( punch training ) , saw clearly better from the bull@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three R@@ uns in the back at the end of the 7th inning , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to the game . &quot;
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t and Simon made his second bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ h@@ ander Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
&quot; Har@@ dy over@@ ran wall , the only man he was confronted with , in front of the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who had a two @-@ run break from the right @-@ handed shoot of Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of runners and the finish @-@ run at the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a Double Play . &quot;
it was the 27th time in the Major League this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe made a Double Play
&quot; after Detroit added an Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth round , Wall created a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; the right @-@ h@@ ander , however , st@@ ables S@@ ano at three pitches for his Fi@@ fth Save . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the game , Detroit benefited from a still un@@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es . &quot;
the tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been deleted before the game by the offen@@ se list after he had missed more than a month because of a back pain .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I desired , &quot; &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ Bat@@ ter first , H@@ ook gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler . &quot;
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z led Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; during the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 successful series with the Run@@ ner in the scor@@ ing position .
&quot; third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers placed in the second , achieved a one @-@ out double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; this was a great blow , &quot; said T@@ wins manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he didn &apos;t beat well , but he got the right spot . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ count , scored no points in the third inning before he was replaced by the reli@@ ever right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter . &quot;
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three R@@ uns on six hits and a walk with four Stri@@ ke@@ outs .
remarks : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired because of a wound injury .
it is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the Sh@@ oul@@ der of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 .
&quot; San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the list of injuries because of a shoulder strap , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP is kn@@ itted by the offen@@ se list by L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris to fight the T@@ wins . &quot;
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the tig@@ ers since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on 30 July
he has been ste@@ aling from the right hip joint since 20 August .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will end their series of three games in the Target field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 ) &quot;
hundreds of refugees are to be accommod@@ ated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; the people in Wiesbaden will then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the city of Wiesbaden broadcast on Tuesday evening . &quot;
she reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 migrants coming to Rwanda .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital have been prepared for this case in recent days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily be accommod@@ ated there .
they are then to be spread over to other municipalities .
&quot; over the past ten days , according to the Pres@@ i@@ dency of the Pres@@ i@@ dency of the Pres@@ i@@ dency , 7@@ 500 people in H@@ esse arrived . &quot;
Frankfurt and Han@@ au have also set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
&quot; the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German involvement in Syria for a possibility . &quot;
&quot; I believe that the resol@@ ute thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he accused the European states &quot; &quot; collective departure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; four years ago , one was happy that the ch@@ ali@@ ce passed a military participation in Germany . &quot;
&quot; now the conflict erup@@ ts in front of our front door , &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the former German ambassador in Washington called for a massive increase of international aid on the spot for refugees . &quot;
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
&quot; after Germany , Austria again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders . &quot;
&quot; the Austrian Home Secretary , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , declared on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV station ORF , and no one was sent back to Hungary . &quot;
&quot; Germany , too , sent no refugees back to Austria . &quot;
&quot; no , this is so agreed , &quot; she explained . &quot;
&quot; on the question of an agreement that Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , there have already been talks between the General Director for Public Safety and Repres@@ ent@@ atives of Germany . &quot;
she did not call it concrete figures and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
&quot; over the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees had come to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route from Hungary . &quot;
their aim is usually Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann have applied for a special summit for next week together with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had begun with temporary border controls on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far failed to agree on concer@@ ted action in the crisis . &quot;
&quot; the ministers of the EU want to take a new approach to the binding distribution of further 120@@ ,000 refugees at a special meeting next Tuesday ( 22 September ) . &quot;
&quot; in view of the strong refugee flow in Germany , the federal government wants to support countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government will manage this jointly with the countries , announced on Tuesday evening after almost four hour consultations with the Prime Ministers of the Federal Chanc@@ ellery in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Merkel under@@ lined , those people who would need protection be@@ ep this too . &quot;
&quot; but if you have no perspective , you can &apos;t stay in Germany either . &quot;
this view was strongly divided in the round .
the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now deal with a &quot; enormous force exer@@ tion . &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route .
Hungary had closed its 175 @-@ kilometer @-@ long border with Serbia on the night of Tuesday .
&quot; a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced that the border with Romania could be set up with a fence . &quot;
this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
&quot; Hungary wants to prevent smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers seeking alternative routes through Romania , Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence . &quot;
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
&quot; in Turkey , according to e@@ ye@@ witness accounts , thousands of other migrants were on their way to the Greek border . &quot;
space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
beneath the Saturn c@@ anz@@ er of Saturn &apos;s En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us a global ocean sp@@ lashes .
this includes researchers from observations of the space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the moon stag@@ gers easily on its path around the ring planets . &quot;
&quot; although this motion is small but still too big for a permanently fixed cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a communication by Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US state of New York ) on Tuesday . &quot;
the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; specialist journal .
even longer it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; thus Cass@@ ini had already discovered ice vul@@ can@@ es at the South Pole of Saturn in 2006 , sp@@ itting water vap@@ our and ice particles and thus feeding the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; E @-@ Ring of Saturn &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; at least at the South Pole , there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed then . &quot;
&quot; however , the extent of the hidden ocean was not clear . &quot;
R@@ ama missing in Munich several weeks
1860 München must rel@@ inqu@@ ish Val@@ det R@@ ama for about a month .
&quot; an investigation conducted an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury in the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , divided the association . &quot;
R@@ ama compla@@ ined about pain at the beginning of the week .
&quot; according to Munich Lion , the diagnosis is expected to last four weeks . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ ber loss . &quot;
&quot; of course , we have to think now , &quot; &quot; said sport director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ remun@@ n of the Bild &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of a united professional . &quot;
&quot; as a training guest , the six@@ ties initially presented a defensive mann . &quot;
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was active recently in Belgium and was already under contract at the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; at present , the Cro@@ at has &quot; the opportunity to prove his ability . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to his conc@@ ussion , goal hunter Rub@@ in Ok@@ ot@@ ie can return to the team training coming week . &quot;
&quot; already on Thursday , the Austrian national player is expected to go into running training . &quot;
Ok@@ ot@@ ie had injured himself in the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) at a violent collision at his head .
&quot; in opposition to his first fears , however , he remained without a serious prof@@ ess@@ orship . &quot;
no diet fruit - man@@ goes contain a lot of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
&quot; but whoever wants to pay attention to his slim line , is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them . &quot;
man@@ goes contain relatively much sugar - mainly su@@ c@@ rose .
&quot; healthy are the exotic fruits nevertheless : in them contain B vitamins , as well as vitamins E and C. In particular , however , man@@ goes contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor to beta @-@ carot@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; people who eat the fruits thus support the vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body . &quot;
&quot; when buying , man@@ goes should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasant . &quot;
&quot; the peel color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is , so green man@@ goes can taste very tasty . &quot;
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
&quot; then , of course , they taste pure or in sweet dishes . &quot;
&quot; however , a man@@ go also gives a special touch to sav@@ our@@ y dishes . &quot;
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
&quot; a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney goes well with fish , poultry , lamb and game . &quot;
&quot; the US package service U@@ PS supplies up to 9@@ 5,000 aid for the Christmas business in the USA . &quot;
&quot; the company began recru@@ iting seasonal workers , announced U@@ PS on Tuesday . &quot;
especially drivers are being sought .
&quot; last year , U@@ PS raised its staff for the holiday season by 9@@ 5,000 aid . &quot;
&quot; in the face of the bo@@ oming online business , U@@ PS and his rival F@@ ed@@ Ex have been making arrangements for the Christmas business since last year . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , delayed deliveries had brought forth harsh criticism to the package services . &quot;
&quot; first fo@@ al tower , then prominent cold front &quot;
&quot; in the coming night , the F@@ öhn stops in the valleys of the Alp@@ en@@ ord side , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Schweiz shared on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday and in the night to Thursday , the fo@@ eh@@ n blows partly with a storm force through the pe@@ at valleys . &quot;
&quot; after f@@ using on Thursday morning , we cross a distinctive cold front which brings heavy rainf@@ alls , wind gu@@ sts and a drop in temperature . &quot;
&quot; as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low @-@ pressure area across the British Is@@ les in a powerful southwest city . &quot;
&quot; on the side of the Alps , the F@@ öhn breaks through the valleys on Wednesday night . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the fo@@ eh@@ n blows until Thursday morning in the valleys with gu@@ sts from 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ i country with over 100 km / h . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ öhn can advance in places to the adjacent Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and on the mountains , even hurri@@ can@@ es of over 120 km / h are possible . &quot;
&quot; while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my fo@@ eh@@ n provides for summer@@ y temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity starts to st@@ ow away at the mountain slope . &quot;
&quot; here , rain sets in , which lasts until Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; in total , in the next 48 hours south of the Alps , some more than 100 liters of rain per square meter must be expected in the next 48 hours , which has already fallen into heavy rainf@@ all over the last few days . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning the air is blowing , followed by a cold front with a strong , partly weather@@ ed rain from west to east via Switzerland . &quot;
&quot; together with the cold front , the wind fresh@@ ens up strongly until stor@@ my , and temperatures decline significantly . &quot;
&quot; the following days are present in the north from 15 to 20 degrees , while in the south it will be sunny and warmer at the weekend with temperatures of up to 25 degrees . &quot;
Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz
almost 500 years after the Reformation in Rome there is now a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz .
&quot; in the presence of City President Ig@@ na@@ zio Mar@@ ino , a hitherto nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Re@@ former . &quot;
&quot; on the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now acknowledged as the &quot; Deutscher The@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot;
the park is located right in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the Working Group of the Evangel@@ ical Churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of Pop@@ es could often live their faith only in secret . &quot;
&quot; in a symbolic way , the square will show that their tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome . &quot;
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) considered himself a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
&quot; at that time , he perceived the city as a comm@@ enting sin@@ ner ba@@ bel . &quot;
his negative impressions are likely to have strengthened him according to historians in his later fight against Rome .
Luther had then initiated the division of the oc@@ ci@@ dental church with his thes@@ es against the departure trading .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gil@@ ded ) crown of thorns is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost wrote the introduction and updated the Bible text .
at the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which has now appeared with splendid pictures . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs . &quot;
&quot; his &quot; language &quot; with colourful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has been preserved for the 75 @-@ year @-@ old , but this is by no means equivalent to &quot; funny &quot; pictures . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary : adapted to the respective topics , this can be quite glo@@ omy . &quot;
&quot; for three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for which he has made a subjective @-@ artistic selection from the many topics of the book &quot; &quot; Book of all books &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; cycles have been created that focus on topics such as cross paths , pla@@ gues , commandments , or pat@@ ernity . &quot;
&quot; as a result , he was immediately fascinated by several partners : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological focus , as well as for the Kettler publishing house , with its emphasis on art books . &quot;
&quot; and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost who , on the basis of painting , dealt with the particular scriptures . &quot;
&quot; he interpre@@ ts the biblical passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and translated into today into current contexts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
&quot; they are embedded between the original Bible quotation of Martin Luther and one set of the artist , who formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts about the situation . &quot;
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
&quot; thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high degree of in@@ timacy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family who belonged to the strict Protestant religious Order . &quot;
&quot; the up@@ bringing happened already with the cane , &quot; &quot; re@@ members Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot;
I tried to work that way in order to bring me to the Lord &apos;s Father .
&quot; his second concern is to restore art to more importance in a quick@@ est time : &quot; today , the perception of visual worlds is marked by advertisement , and that is loud . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is being displaced .
artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewer to &quot; &quot; slide down &quot; &quot; into the images , let them appear , discover and sense the power they have : &quot; the image is looking for its counterpart . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; &quot; always &quot; &quot; to have been a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
&quot; I have not taken care not to fully grasp the Bible , but also selected the themes which are important to him , including mysterious themes . &quot;
&quot; this was not a collaboration on eye level , &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; here are the pictures , the text only explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler of Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s paintings speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
&quot; a part of the original - paper and canvas wall pictures - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation on November 15 . &quot;
start of construction for BM@@ X railway
&quot; a year later , almost everything was ready - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway it was already finished . &quot;
&quot; om@@ is@@ sions in politics and administration provided for dr@@ one , especially among residents who did not want to tolerate the railways . &quot;
&quot; so hill desc@@ ended , new place searched - now with formal planning and application for building permit . &quot;
&quot; the approval will take place in October , the First Community coun@@ cill@@ or Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now able to communicate in the children &apos;s and youth committee . &quot;
&quot; I hope this year will happen again , &quot; she said . &quot;
it should then be started with the works of the former indoor swimming pool without a &quot; further pause . &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies engagement for refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees by 2019 , with a clear signal on the weekend . &quot;
the football is responding to the situation in Germany and securing its help in dealing with the problems that arise .
&quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; no one can say in principle , that doesn &apos;t bother me , I don &apos;t have anything to do with it . &quot;
&quot; this must be of interest to everyone to get a grip on this topic , &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he will discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively . &quot;
&quot; I am next Wednesday in the Chanc@@ ellery and meet the Minister of State , Mrs Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the topic will certainly play a central role , &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot;
football can and wants to help .
but the crucial points must be the policy .
the German Football League has therefore extended its Refu@@ gee Initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; for four years .
&quot; through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation , we have ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; explained Ni@@ ers@@ bach on the ver@@ ge of the UEF@@ A session in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
some federal authorities also support this program .
&quot; already on this weekend , the 36 professional clubs set a clear sign when they will wear the &quot; &quot; # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; &quot; print instead of the usual sponsor logos ( Her@@ mes ) instead of the usual sponsor logos ( Her@@ mes ) . &quot;
&quot; we also want to make it clear that everyone should help , where and how they can , &quot; &quot; said L@@ ever@@ kus@@ en &apos;s Sports Director Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler in the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; a matter of course . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee drama goes on everybody , nobody can see it . &quot;
&quot; we can use football feder@@ ations , no , we must use our bril@@ liance , influence and opportunities to help the many refugees that have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig addressed a &quot; prominent &quot; division of the league .
&quot; on Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale . &quot;
Ni@@ ers@@ bach called the support of refugees as &quot; a large common work of German football . &quot;
the fact that all 36 licensing agreements had started their own projects would be great .
it is just as great that small and small clubs are active there .
the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; we spent will be lived in football .
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in this and next year , the association will jointly provide 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees together with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government . &quot;
&quot; the clubs have already retri@@ eved the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach reported . &quot;
reports : SAP managing director loses an eye in case of accident
&quot; according to several reports , the Chief Executive Officer of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , lost the left eye due to a fall at the beginning of July . &quot;
&quot; after the accident on the staircase in his brother &apos;s house in the USA , he fell to a water glass after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is almost bleeding , fa@@ inted , then he got out of the road - that &apos;s what he told us last week , &quot; &quot; quoted the &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could do his job .
&quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the meeting of the Supervisory Board in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot;
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager was attending the meeting and &quot; fully working . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung ( Thursday &apos;s issue ) that he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to lead the software group .
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal story , &quot; said the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; : &quot; everyone can do something like this . &quot;
it is important to stand up once you have fallen down .
Mc@@ L@@ aren replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen except skir@@ mish ...

football : Bv@@ B without R@@ eus against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
&quot; at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco R@@ eus in the first group match of the Europa League have definitely sh@@ attered . &quot;
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the soccer league in Du@@ eling with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19@@ .00 / Sky ) .
&quot; unfortunately we cannot resort to him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; whether R@@ eus will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga soccer game against L@@ ever@@ kus@@ en again , the B@@ V@@ B coach announced : &quot; &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in view of the high burden of its professionals , Tu@@ va will not only change its trunk position on the R@@ eus position . &quot;
he announced a change to the goal keeper &apos;s position .
that is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller occupies the place of house@@ keeper Roman br@@ ki .
&quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion . &quot;
&quot; however , Tu@@ va left open , whether soft f@@ eller in the future will be used in all European league games . &quot;
&quot; with a high probability , he will also contest the second game . &quot;
&quot; mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian Wei@@ gl p@@ onder@@ s the for@@ ceful statement by fellow player R@@ eus that the final move for the B@@ V@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , meaning Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
I think we have a good chance to pick up the title .
robot cars : government wants to lead the way for Germany
&quot; according to the will of the Federal Government , Germany should be a technological pioneer in changing the car . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on a strategy paper from the house of transport ministers Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which included investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the ver@@ ge of the Auto Show IA@@ A from a &quot; new mobility era . &quot;
&quot; automated and connected driving will increase road safety and ensure less traffic jams , &quot; said Do@@ brin@@ dt . &quot;
&quot; he also wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , who come together with industry representatives at the IA@@ A . &quot;
&quot; among other things , the Transport Ministry &apos;s strategy paper highlights the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and rapid increase in digital radio communication . &quot;
a test track on the 9 motorway in Bavaria is currently being tested for testing new technology .
&quot; in order for the driver to &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks be imposed &quot; , &quot; the Federal Government intends to &quot; &quot; check the legal framework &quot; &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; for example , Germany wants to use it internationally for the maximum speed allowed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 km / h . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Federal Government intends to commit itself to a change in the Vienna Convention , which has so far only envis@@ aged man as a driver . &quot;
&quot; automated driving is increasingly taking the lead , the driver becomes more and more passenger . &quot;
the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds .
&quot; according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads are expected to reach far after 2020 . &quot;
&quot; in the field of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at the German site , the authors of the study estimate the value of 20@@ 25 to around 8.@@ 4 billion euros . &quot;
&quot; the digital networking of cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said SPD traffic politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
&quot; however , the question of liability in accidents and the safety of the driver &apos;s personal data must be clearly clari@@ fied . &quot;
but the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars still look skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
&quot; a survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday , commissioned by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the Veri@@ fication process , came to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will assert themselves in the coming ten years , 32 percent do not expect that 31 percent do not believe in it at all . &quot;
&quot; in France , 21 percent of respon@@ dents estimate up to 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars , 33 percent in the US . &quot;
&quot; anyway , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle . &quot;
&quot; following a survey by Digital Union Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to pass control over the entire journey across the road . &quot;
&quot; on the motorway , the traffic in flowing traffic could be 15 percent , 45 percent in traffic jams . &quot;
every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances under any circumstances .
Bol@@ l says team and double start at table tennis champion
&quot; after the current status of the title fight from 25 September to 4 October , Dus@@ sel@@ dorf will only hit the ground . &quot;
the final decision shall be made at the latest on September 22 .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boys learned it in the morning .
&quot; but we are strong enough to win the title even without Timo , &quot; &quot; said head coach Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf at the European Championship in Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; at this time , Bol@@ l was on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsor@@ ship mine in China . &quot;
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; without Timo the down@@ side , we are no longer such a clear favorite , &quot; &quot; declared Single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot;
&quot; the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the S@@ etz@@ kl@@ ist in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded the EM 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at . &quot;
&quot; Timo also lack@@ ed , and we became European champion . &quot;
&quot; we should focus on this , &quot; explained the world ranking factor . &quot;
the English football team Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United has drawn a serious injury on the right leg .
&quot; in the Champions League match at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven , the defender was hit by a Tac@@ kl@@ ing by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno and changed after a long treatment . &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant terrible
it is a mixture of a very big fashion show and a wax figur@@ ine cab@@ ar@@ et : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
&quot; the highlights are the display mannequins , which look frigh@@ ten@@ ingly human thanks to video projections . &quot;
&quot; they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer who , among others , became the great star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts . &quot;
today I can no longer say that I am the en@@ f@@ ant terrible of Haute cou@@ ture because I have white hair .
&quot; earlier it was ble@@ ached , now it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from September 18 at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is fortunate that the fashion designer changed his attitude towards a show about his person at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; actually he was on the other hand , because : &quot; for me , an exhibition sounded a bit like death , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; when you die , you get into the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had been done in Montreal and in Paris .
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful clothes , &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society . &quot;
&quot; the exhibits give an insight into the work of the man who has hardly overlooked the fashion history , without ever having completed an apprenticeship . &quot;
&quot; chron@@ ologically , the show is not built up , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ed complete artwork , for which much effort was carried out : to fro@@ ze the d@@ olls , for example , a sty@@ list was hired . &quot;
&quot; according to information from the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the makers have bar@@ red 14 tonnes of material in Munich . &quot;
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was still a special treat : a leather pants @-@ outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers old Ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , hes@@ it@@ ant fashion attempts of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) , he put on his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; playing with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him . &quot;
he later contributed to designing fashion .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers who talked to Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought it then of course .
he did not have to pay the models for his first fashion show .
&quot; they got nothing , but were allowed to keep the clothes . &quot;
jewelry instead of curtain - Le@@ ading tip as fashion niche
&quot; in the past , it was about the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make meters . &quot;
&quot; the embroi@@ dered fabrics and spi@@ kes were developed in great numbers for customers , who worked for example for blankets and she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this is no longer working today , &quot; explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the P@@ lau@@ en gran@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; instead , fashion is important again . &quot;
&quot; in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze ® played a larger role , it was then displaced by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls a few examples : lace in jewelry , for accessories such as bags and for regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which re@@ jects past sti@@ p@@ po@@ chen , is an increasing order potential . &quot;
anyone who has no ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market .
&quot; with us , they already make half of all orders . &quot;
&quot; together with nine other companies , P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and Sti@@ cker@@ eien . &quot;
only they may carry the protected label .
&quot; over the past 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been broken away . &quot;
there are almost no private shops and also the wholesale trade .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
the mass @-@ produced commodity is produced much cheaper today in the Asian region and almost exclusively distributed over chains .
&quot; exports are also weaker , up @-@ to @-@ date to Russia and the US . &quot;
so there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association seeks to score points also through environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula farmer von der Stick@@ per@@ le in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; since this year we have been leading a seal of quality that shows that we produce environmentally and socially compatible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
&quot; at the Schne@@ e@@ berger branch of the West@@ säch@@ sische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au , graduate designer U@@ te Schmidt is teaching at the Faculty of Applied Arts , speci@@ alizing in embroi@@ der@@ ies and spi@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; in order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , one has to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
this takes time and courage .
&quot; there is a conflict of tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and the companies that have to think economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design is often only slightly varied to maintain a customer base . &quot;
&quot; a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter re@@ affir@@ med the historic snow@@ ball point . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the machine li@@ cks small spheres in some places . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ lau@@ ener gold@@ smith master Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße took inspiration from it : &quot; &quot; before I could not start with traditional P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze ® . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
&quot; in an elaborate procedure , it shapes the pattern in silver . &quot;
&quot; many people in the region identify themselves with the topic of P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze ® - young and old , &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; it also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and who would like to have a mem@@ or@@ abili@@ a . &quot;
thus I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze ® .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
&quot; legends are not to be touched , but Disney dar@@ es to take a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; however , it is not about a new movie , but a kind of sequ@@ el that takes place 20 years after the first film with the magic chil@@ dr@@ ens girl . &quot;
it is about the experiences of the N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the world economic crisis in England .
who plays P@@ opp@@ in more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
&quot; but the director is already clear : Ro@@ b Marshall , finally with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema . &quot;
XI ur@@ ges to open the economy wider for the world
&quot; the economy needs to open wide out@@ wards to promote growth , said President Xi Jin@@ ping on Tuesday of a group that was t@@ asked with steering the reform . &quot;
&quot; China should be committed to attracting foreign investment and expertise and improving the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Executive Committee for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; promoting new start @-@ ups and driving reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and offer new place for economic growth , said Xi . &quot;
&quot; the management group has adopted a series of guidelines , including a negative list for regulating market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the citizen reporting system . &quot;
&quot; after the statement , a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investments . &quot;
the system is gradually being tested and improved by test programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance , as it has a greater role in the allocation of resources to the market , ensuring a rule @-@ of @-@ law business environment and more open to the market , said the statement . &quot;
the government will also lo@@ osen control over the powers transferred to the company and make sure that companies decide how to conduct their business .
the statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
&quot; as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas are opened for private investment . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policy vis @-@ à @-@ vis foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; furthermore it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot;
&quot; to guarantee the right of lawyers to exercise their activity , and to employ professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot;
&quot; at the meeting , Premier Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated in the meeting , as reported in a declaration published after the meeting . &quot;
EU wants to double up mercury @-@ limit value in predat@@ ory fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predat@@ ory fish and thus mi@@ tig@@ ate consumers a significantly higher dose of the pesti@@ cide . &quot;
&quot; the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , which is present in the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force of pregnant women and infants , &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t at F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t , the limit values of the nerve agent for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish , should be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish . &quot;
&quot; large predat@@ ors , however , are already so strongly polluted with mercury , that on the basis of the remaining limit values , about 50 percent of the catches are not allowed to be sold . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be un@@ market@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in return for this e@@ asing , EU @-@ based F@@ ood@@ watch wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values of other fish from 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; but F@@ ood@@ watch described this as a &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller Fried@@ fishes , such as car@@ p , are usually so low that they are already comp@@ iling the planned maximum values . &quot;
&quot; the lowering at Kl@@ einf@@ urt is therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ dy disper@@ sion maneu@@ ver that helps the economy alone , &quot; says Wolfgang Sch@@ mid@@ t . &quot;
&quot; mercury is a heavy @-@ toxic heavy metal , which is highly toxic to humans , especially in predat@@ ory fish . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; even small quantities can cause damage to the nervous system especially in the case of un@@ born damage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Federal Environment Ministry says on its homepage with regard to the current maximum values , however , that a &quot; &quot; health hazard of the general population &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot;
mercury is mainly caused by coal combustion in the environment .
&quot; according to a written information from the Federal Ministry of the Environment , the German coal @-@ fired power plants dischar@@ ged more than six tons of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total quantity em@@ itted in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mercury in fish , for example , in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; permanent and surface @-@ covering , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; quoted from paper in March . &quot;
&quot; last year , EU @-@ wide warnings against mercury in fish were already among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU @-@ hazard warning system RA@@ S@@ FF . &quot;
F@@ ood@@ watch invites consumers to protest against EU &apos;s plans at www.@@ qu@@ eck@@ mercury @-@ ac@@ .@@ stand watch@@ .de
