&quot; considering the Ord@@ in@@ ance of the Swiss Federal Council of 23 December 1971 on the use of the Swiss name for watches , &quot;
&quot; in view of the close industrial cooperation between the European Economic Community and Switzerland , in the watch@@ making industry , &quot;

watches and movements assembled from these raw materials and components must meet the requirements of statutory technical control in Switzerland .
2 . the list of raw materials produced in the Community is revised periodi@@ cally following the following mod@@ alities :
&quot; a ) The application for admission of new raw material cali@@ bers into the list is directed by the associations of the watch@@ making industry of the community , or from the manufacturers of raw materials , to the Swiss watch@@ men &apos;s chamber . the application is to add a technical description of the raw material cali@@ ber . &quot;
the Swiss watch@@ dog carries this or the new cali@@ bers immediately to the so @-@ called list .

&quot; B ) The withdrawal of the raw material calibr@@ es listed in the list is communicated by the associations of the watch@@ making industry of the Community , or by the manufacturer who had previously requested the recording , the Swiss watch@@ making chamber . &quot;
&quot; C ) If the requirements of statutory technical control in Switzerland are not authorised , the Swiss watch@@ dog may demand the submission of the relevant raw material cali@@ bers from the list ; it teaches the party concerned . &quot;
&quot; if this does not agree , it can take the procedure in paragraph 3 within two months . &quot;
&quot; D ) Every request to change the list according to the letters a ) , b ) and c ) shall be immediately displayed to the Gem@@ is@@ chten parade by the Swiss watch@@ dog . &quot;

&quot; in view of this report , the institutes agree to extract a game of clo@@ cks or movements from a Swiss company and from a company of the community , which is sufficiently representative and basically no more than 50 watches or movements . &quot;
&quot; after checking these games in accordance with the standards of statutory technical control in Switzerland , the institutes compare their results and create a common report for the Joint Commission with their conclusions and with their suggestions . &quot;
the agreement and the list attached to it will be published in the official publication organs of the contracting parties and communicated to the watch@@ makers by the relevant professional associations .
&quot; at least every three years , calculated from the entry into force of the agreement , the Mi@@ xed Commission takes a re@@ design of the list in order to take account of the entries and matches that have been carried out . &quot;
&quot; the agreement will take effect on 1 January 1973 , if the rati@@ fication certificates have been exchanged at this time . &quot;
&quot; if the exchange of rati@@ fication documents takes place between January 1 and November 30 , 1973 , the agreement will take effect on the first day of the second on the next month &apos;s exchange . &quot;

B ) i ) The organization requires only the minimum amount of information and data compatible with the implementation of its tasks in accordance with this Convention .
&quot; II ) Information about equipment is limited to the minimum size , which is necessary for the use of safety measures in relation to nuclear material , which is subject to the safety measures according to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; C ) At the request of the community , the organisation is willing to consider investment data which the community considers as particularly vulnerable to check in the premises of the community . &quot;
&quot; this data does not require the organization to be transferred materi@@ ally , provided that it remains accessible for further testing by the organization in the premises of the community . &quot;
a ) i ) The organization fet@@ ches the consent of the community and states to the designation of inspec@@ tors for the states .
&quot; II ) If the Community abol@@ ishes either a proposed designation or at any time against a term granted , the organisation of the Community and the States proposes one or more alternative denom@@ inations . &quot;
&quot; pursuant to the repeated refusal of the Community to agree to the designation of inspec@@ tors of the organization , which are imp@@ eded by this Convention , the Council shall discuss the refusal after it is referred to as the General Director of the Organization - in the following as the &quot; &quot; General Director &quot; &quot; - with the aim of meeting suitable measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The Community and the States concerned shall take the necessary steps to ensure that the inspec@@ tors of the organization , after their agreement , can actually feel the tasks ahead . &quot;
C ) The visits and activities of the inspec@@ tors of the organization are arranged in such a way that i ) are as low as possible for the possible har@@ ass@@ ment and distur@@ b@@ ance for the community and the states and for the peaceful nuclear activities that are subject to inspection ;
II ) the protection of industrial secrets and other confidential information is ensured by the inspec@@ tors of the organization .
&quot; each State applies to the organization , including its assets , funds and assets , as well as to its inspec@@ tors and other civil servants , the tasks of this agreement , the corresponding provisions of the agreement on the pr@@ ero@@ g@@ atives and liber@@ ations of the International Atom@@ ic Energy Organisation . &quot;
&quot; the safegu@@ arding measures after this agreement will be concluded with regard to core material , if the community and the organization notice that the material is used or dil@@ uted in a way that it is no longer usable for nuclear activity , which is under the point of the security measures of Bel@@ ang , or has become virtually non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the Community , according to the agreement of this Convention , noti@@ fies the transfer of nuclear material from the states that are subject to the safegu@@ arding measures according to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the safegu@@ arding measures after this agreement will be terminated with regard to core material as soon as the recipient state , as envis@@ aged in this agreement , has assumed responsibility for it . &quot;
&quot; the organization carries out documents , from which any transfer and , if necessary , the re @-@ use of the safety measures on the given core material . &quot;
&quot; core material , which is subject to this Convention , should be used in non @-@ nuclear activities such as the manufacture of alloys or ceramics , so the community agrees with the organization of such use of the material under which circumstances the securing measures can be terminated in relation to this material . &quot;
II ) that the material is not used for the manufacture of nuclear weapons and other core explo@@ sives in the duration of non @-@ application of the safety measures in accordance with this Convention .
&quot; B ) The organization and community shall make a provision , that the preventive measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall not be applied only as long as the core material is used in such an activity . &quot;
&quot; as far as possible , the regulation will determine how long and under what circumstances these preventive measures will not be applied . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the safety measures envis@@ aged in this agreement will once again be applied once the core material is returned to a peaceful nuclear operation . &quot;
&quot; the organisation is held on the ongoing basis over the total quantity and composition of this material in the state or the concerned States , and on any transfer of such material from this state or states . &quot;
&quot; this explains its consent as quickly as possible ; it only extends to matters such as temporal and proced@@ ural provisions and agreements for reporting , but does not include a endor@@ sement or sec@@ rec@@ y of the military activity , and does not refer to the use of the core material . &quot;
&quot; the organization , the community and the states bear the costs that each of them grow from this agreement in carrying out their respective obligations . &quot;
&quot; if the community , the states or persons who are subject to their sovereignty , but extraordinary expenses are incurred as a result of a special request of the organization , the organisation will reimbur@@ se these costs as long as they have agreed beforehand in advance . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the organisation bears the costs of all additional measurements and samples required by the inspec@@ tors of the organization . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the states ensure that the liability protection for nuclear damages , including an insurance or other financial security , may be used in accordance with their laws and other provisions , to the organisation and its officials for the purposes of carrying out this agreement in the same way as to the nationals of the states . &quot;
&quot; any claim to which the Community or the State vis @-@ à @-@ vis the organization or the organization vis @-@ à @-@ vis the Community or the Organization for damages - with the exception of damages from a nuclear incident , which have ar@@ isen from the implementation of the safety measures in accordance with this agreement , will be governed in accordance with international law . &quot;
&quot; after examination of the relevant information provided by the General Director , the council states that the organisation must not be able to verify that no core material , which must be subject to safety measures after this Convention , will be able to refund the reports provided in Article X@@ II paragraph C of the Stat@@ utes and , if necessary , take the other measures provided there . &quot;
&quot; in such steps , the Council takes into account which mass has been acquired by the applied safety measures , and offers the community or the state - as far as each of the two parties involved is concerned - every reasonable opportunity to give the Council the necessary certainty . &quot;
&quot; on request of the organization , community or state consultations are held on questions arising from the interpretation or application of this agreement . &quot;
the Community and the States are entitled to request that any questions arising from the interpretation or application of this agreement shall be examined by the Council .
the Council encourages the community and the affected state to participate in the discussion of such questions through the Council .
&quot; with the exception of disputes , a statement of the Council pursuant to Article 19 or a procedure adopted by the Council are disputes resulting from the interpretation or application of this agreement and which are not included in the negotiation way or by another of the organisation , community and states agreed on by a party consisting of five arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the community and the states design@@ ate two arbitr@@ ators , the organization also names two arbitr@@ ators , and the four arbitr@@ ators named arbitr@@ ators choose a fifth which leads the chair@@ manship . &quot;
&quot; if the Community and the States or the Organization have not designated two arbitr@@ ators within thirty days of the request of an arbitr@@ ator , the Community or the organization may request the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint these arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
the same procedure shall be applied if the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been elected within thirty days of the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator .
&quot; a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal are competent , and all resolutions require the consent of at least three arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal are binding for the organisation , the community and the states concerned . &quot;
&quot; ( a ) This Convention shall apply to non @-@ nuclear non @-@ nuclear states , the contracting party of the contract and members of the Community , in force , i ) when the relevant state of the organization is notified that its proceedings are concluded for the entry into force of this Convention ; &quot;
&quot; II ) If the Community of the Organization is notified that it is able to apply its security measures in relation to this state , for the purposes of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The organization , the community and the states consult each other at the request of one of the contracting parties on a change of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; B ) All changes require the consent of the organization , the community and the states . &quot;
C ) The General Director shall immediately inform all Member States of the organization of any change of this Convention .
&quot; a ) This Convention enters into force the day in which the organization of the Community and the States receives the written notification , that their procedures for entry into force are concluded . &quot;
B ) This Convention shall remain in force as long as the States Parties to the contract .
&quot; the term &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the Convention and the Protocol . &quot;
&quot; the purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine the procedure , as required in the implementation of the provisions of Part I on securing measures . &quot;
the aim of the safegu@@ arding measures laid down in this agreement is the timely discovery of the bran@@ ching of significant quantities of nuclear weapons of peaceful nuclear activities for the manufacture of nuclear weapons and other core explo@@ sives for unknown purposes as well as the deter@@ rence of such a bran@@ ching by the risk of premature discovery .
&quot; to enrich the target defined in Article 28 , material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , combined with spatial input and observation as important supplementary measures . &quot;
&quot; the technical completion of the audi@@ ts by the organization is carried out by an explanation , in which for each material balance zone the quantity of material not assigned for a certain period is specified by speci@@ fying the accuracy limits for the specified amounts . &quot;
&quot; in carrying out their tests , the organization is making full use of the community &apos;s security system after Article 3 . &quot;
the accounting and control system for the core material in accordance with this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
&quot; in the application of their security measures , the Community will make use of the procedures and actions of the following manner and , as far as necessary , see how they are determined and useful in the supplementary agreements : &quot;
&quot; a ) a measurement system to determine the quantities of preserved , produced , lost , lost or otherwise removed core material and inventory ; &quot;
B ) the evaluation of reprodu@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ;
&quot; C ) procedures for determining , checking and evaluating differences in the measurements of sender and recipient ; &quot;
e ) procedures for valuation of accum@@ ulations of non @-@ measured hol@@ dings and not measured losses ;
&quot; F ) a protocol and reporting system , which points out the core material inventory and the changes in the inventory , including the one and outputs of the material balance zone for each material balance zone ; &quot;
&quot; g ) precau@@ tions , which ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ; &quot;
h ) procedures for reimbur@@ sement of reports to the organization in accordance with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the safety measures after this agreement do not extend to material in mining or ore processing .
&quot; B ) If the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described under the letter c ) is not yet reached into the states , the Community of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material provided that it is not introduced for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ; &quot;
&quot; C ) leaves the core material , which is suitable for the composition and purity of fuel production or is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , the plant or the process phase in which it is manufactured or is introduced into the states in a later phase of the nuclear @-@ fuel cycle , so it is subject to the other safety measures mentioned in this Agreement . &quot;
&quot; a ) The provisions provided in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 11 . if the provisions mentioned in Article 11 are not met or requested , the organisation and the community consult each other on the use of suitable securing measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The safety measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the organisation and the community realize that this core material is practically non @-@ ref@@ und@@ able . &quot;
&quot; upon request of the Community , the organization fre@@ es the following core material from the security measures following this agreement : &quot;
a ) special fis@@ si@@ le material when used in grams or smaller amounts as a sensor in instruments ;
&quot; B ) nuclear material , if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities in accordance with Article 13 , if such a core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and &quot;
&quot; C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is over 80 % . &quot;
&quot; on request of the community , the organisation fre@@ es the core material which would otherwise be subject to preventive measures pursuant to this agreement , provided that the total amount of nuclear material delivered in the states is no longer available as a result of this Article in the States . &quot;
a ) a kil@@ ogram of special p@@ alt@@ able material that can consist of one or more of the following materials :
&quot; ur@@ anium with an accumulation of 0,2 ( 20 % ) and above , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of its weight with the enrich@@ ment , &quot;
&quot; III ) Ur@@ an with a enrich@@ ment , which lies below 0,2 ( 20 % ) and above the von Natur@@ ur@@ an , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of its weight with the five @-@ fold square of enrich@@ ment ; &quot;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an accumulation of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
&quot; C ) Tw@@ enty metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ anium , with an accumulation of 0,@@ 00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ; &quot;
&quot; if liberated core material is to be processed or stored together with the core material , which is subject to the safety measures according to this agreement , provisions for the re@@ use of the securing measures are taken on the material . &quot;
&quot; the community meets the organization of supplementary agreements , which are necessary in the scope that is necessary for the successful and effective exhaus@@ tion of the tasks of the organization according to this agreement , in particular how the procedures laid down in the Convention are applicable . &quot;
the supplementary agreements can be extended or changed without alter@@ ing this agreement in agreement between the organization and the community .
&quot; the supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention . the organisation , the community and the states undertake all efforts to allow these agreements to enter into force within nin@@ ety days of the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization , the community and the states . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the initial report listed in Article 62 , the Organization sets up a consolidated inventory of the underlying nuclear material contained in the states , regardless of its origin , and continues to carry out this inventory account due to the subsequent reports and the results of their subsequent checks . &quot;
&quot; between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organization ( Organisation ) &quot;
&quot; GR@@ Ü@@ N@@ DE - a ) The E@@ EC has decided to contribute to the special action programme defined at the Conference for International Economic Cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is ham@@ pered by general resource transfer problems . &quot;
&quot; C ) It is the aim of the E@@ EC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States depends within six months of entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years of entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal . &quot;
D ) The E@@ EC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted each other about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the intermediate bonds in order to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
&quot; to this end , the organization of the E@@ EC has presented a table which can be seen in which way it intends to apply the criteria specified in this agreement - &quot;
&quot; the organization speci@@ fies a special account under the name &quot; &quot; Special Respon@@ sive Account &quot; &quot; which consists of the funds that the Member States contribute to the special transactions account ; this account is managed by the organization as administrator , and used ( in this property , the organization is referred to as &quot; &quot; car@@ et@@ aker &quot; &quot; ) , only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
the special transaction will be separately and separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
&quot; the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or non @-@ interest deb@@ tors of the Member State , which must be paid on demand in the currency of the respective State at order of the organization as the administrator of the special transaction and to deposit in the deposit of the organization in the country concerned . &quot;
B ) The payment is made in two install@@ ments ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the entry within 30 days after the entry into force of this agreement or to another between the E@@ EC and the administrator agreed time ;
&quot; II ) the second in the amount of the balance of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at another point agreed between the E@@ EC and the administrator , taking into account the deadlines necessary for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans . &quot;
C ) Every Member State may wish to make payments before the above mentioned dates .
&quot; in accordance with the usual procedures of the organization , the administrator takes approximately proportional draw on the cash or the school j@@ esh@@ ein to cover the expenses for the special transaction loan and to balance the special transaction bank in an appropriate manner . &quot;
&quot; when granting this loan , the administrator can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the E@@ EC : &quot;
the extent in which international economic factors have contributed to the present and fores@@ eeable economic problems of the country ;
&quot; VI ) of the composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its further lending capacity to loan terms , without discount ; and &quot;
VII ) the extent in which the problems of the countries concerned can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
&quot; each transaction loan is used to finance a clearly defined and rapidly @-@ paying development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral sponsor@@ ship ) , regardless of whether it is part of the loan programme of the organization or not , according to the procedures and practices , which are considered to be the objective of this agreement which is referred to under the letter b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the funds of the special transaction may not be used instead of ordinary funds from the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the organization , which has already been approved by the Bank &apos;s directors or the organization within the framework of a loan or credit for a program or project . &quot;
&quot; apart from section 4 , special transactions are subject to the same re@@ payment conditions , which are generally applicable to the organization provided by the organization ; they are thus ref@@ und@@ able in 50 years each . &quot;
&quot; special transactions are granted in one or more currencies of member states , and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies . &quot;
payments to pay this clock are directly to be paid to the organization that maintains it .
&quot; each transaction loan is issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in which the origin of the funds is stated in particular . &quot;
&quot; revenue from every transaction loan can be used for expenditure in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services produced or provided in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries , the members of the organization and who , according to the stipul@@ ations of what the administrator has set at the time of the loan guarantee , could be bene@@ fici@@ aries of a special transaction loan . &quot;
&quot; capital withdraw@@ als from transaction loans are made to the special transactions account , and the amount paid in the currency of a member state is to be re@@ mitted as soon as possible by the administrator to the Member State concerned . &quot;
&quot; until full disclosure of all the special transaction loans , the administrator has informed the E@@ EC about the plans and programmes approved by the directors in preparation for the examination by the directors . &quot;
&quot; during the time of the pa@@ yout of the special transaction loan , the administrator has informed the E@@ EC quarterly on the development of the special transaction loans and the expenses incurred for this purpose . &quot;
&quot; as soon as possible after completion of the financial year , the administrator con@@ veys a detailed invoice of the special transaction bank with a statement from the external audi@@ tor of the organization to this account statement . &quot;
&quot; after full payment of the special transaction loan , the administrator of the E@@ EC will soon be able to report a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special transaction bank . &quot;
&quot; the administrator creates and performs appropriate records and accounts , from which the contributions to the special transactions account , which have been paid from the account recei@@ pts to financial obligations , which have been paid to the account and the deposits paid out of the account and the re@@ payments to the Member States . &quot;
the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ akers work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
&quot; to this end , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the ste@@ wards until the full issue of the funds from the special action account , conduct an exchange of ideas about the state of the special transaction , the progress of programmes financed by special actions or projects and on any other issues related to the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; if this agreement was not entered into force on 31 December 1978 , or at a later time when the E@@ EC and the organization agreed , the agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties are due immediately . &quot;
&quot; if the total capital amount of all the special transaction loans taken in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement is rep@@ aid and re@@ mitted to the Member States , this agreement and all the resul@@ t@@ ant obligations of the parties are terminated with immediate effect . &quot;
this agreement requires the approval of the individual Member States and the E@@ EC in accordance with the proced@@ ural provisions of each party .
the governments of the Member States notified the General Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities to conclude the proceedings in question .
the Sec@@ retariat shall carry out these noti@@ fications along with a Noti@@ fication on the proper approval of this Agreement by the E@@ EC to the Organisation .
this agreement is effective and enters into force on the first day of the month that follows the day of receipt of the mentioned noti@@ fications in the organization .
&quot; this agreement is written in two in@@ scriptions in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch languages , with each wording as binding . &quot;
&quot; whereas the agreement must be concluded in the form of a letter changing to the amend@@ ment of the Anne@@ x A of the Protocol no . 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) , the following VER@@ OR@@ D@@ N@@ TION : &quot;
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics
&quot; the EURO@@ P@@ Ä@@ IS@@ CHE nuclear community , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after called &quot; Commission . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after called &quot; Switzerland , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after referred to as the Federal Council , &quot;
&quot; this program comprises the creation of a large test facility , the J@@ ET ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) project , the construction and operation of a joint venture in accordance with Chapter V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty - herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Joint Enterprise J@@ ET . &quot; &quot;
Switzerland has been dealing with research in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics for several years and is well acquainted with the area concerned .
&quot; since extensive work is still carried out until the practical use of the controlled nuclear fusion , it is in the interest of the contracting parties of the present agreement to reduce their respective efforts to avoid unnecessary over@@ laps and to accelerate their respective research , which have gained a higher priority due to the energy crisis - &quot;
&quot; this agreement is intended to enable every contracting party to take advantage of unnecessary over@@ laps in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics from the funds provided for both research work and to achieve the common goal of this research , i.e. the cost @-@ effective competitive electricity generation by using the controlled core fusion reaction . &quot;
&quot; to achieve the goal of the present agreement , the Parties shall associate their respective research programmes defined in Anne@@ x I and II of this agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Eur@@ atom Program &quot; and &quot; Swiss Program . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure effective cooperation , the Swiss programme takes over the long @-@ term objectives and forms of cooperation between the Eur@@ atom programme ; it is extended or modified by the organs mentioned in Article 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present agreement that may include new activities relevant to the Eur@@ atom program . &quot;
&quot; every time the parties receive a new programme , this will be replaced by the programs listed in Anne@@ x I and II to the present agreement . &quot;
the Associ@@ ations intended in paragraph 1 are realised by : - proportion@@ ate participation of each of the contracting parties during the preparation and execution of the programs of the other party ;
&quot; - Exchange of personnel under the affected laboratories in the Eur@@ atom Member States , Switzerland and the third countries with which Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , as well as the laboratories that work on the Eur@@ atom programme ; &quot;
- mutual right to access to the scientific and technical results of the respective programs .
&quot; within the scope of the target of the present agreement , Switzerland particip@@ ates in the J@@ ET project . &quot;
&quot; in view of the association agreement provided in Article 2 of this Agreement , the Parties concluded an association agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Association Agreement , &quot; which is as far as possible to those between the Commission and the states and companies or individuals , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Associ@@ ated Organ@@ s , &quot; with regard to the realization of the Eur@@ atom programme . &quot;
&quot; the same objective is to ensure that Switzerland is involved in the agreement on the promotion of human resource exchange between the Commission and the Associ@@ ated Organ@@ s , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Agreement on Person@@ s Exchange . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with regard to the participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland is part of the joint venture J@@ ET with the date of the entry into force of the present agreement , its stat@@ ute it accepts . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Eur@@ atom fears that Switzerland can become a contractual partner of any contract , except association agreements or other similar contracts concluded by Eur@@ atom during the period of validity of the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; the bodies responsible for carrying out the association provided in Article 2 , paragraph 1 of the present Convention , are described in articles 5 to 10 of this agreement and in the association agreement . &quot;
&quot; the Association Agreement , in particular , includes the suspension of a steering committee , the responsible representative of the Commission and the Federal Council . &quot;
&quot; - to monitor the development of the research work , and to make it possible to achieve the best possible results in accordance with the objectives of this agreement . &quot;
Switzerland is represented by a maximum of two delegates in the connection group used within the Eur@@ atom programme - in the following &quot; VG . &quot;
&quot; the VG , which has to ensure the exchange of information and cooperation in all matters concerning the ongoing or planned programmes and activities in the Eur@@ atom programme , is responsible for all research and development activities that apply to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it promotes cooperation and coordination between the Associ@@ ated Organ@@ s and al@@ ig@@ ns its T * worth@@ iness in the interests of both parties to the common goal specified in the Eur@@ atom programme and in the Swiss programme as well as the common goal defined in Article 1 of the present agreement , taking into account the scientific and technological developments emerging in the world . &quot;
&quot; pursuant to its Rules of Proced@@ ure , the VG ap@@ points one or more Swiss representatives in the consulting groups created within the Eur@@ atom Program , whenever the competent Swiss authorities are looking for it . &quot;
&quot; the advisory groups , which the VG research proposals are considering to provide the best possible scientific results for the Eur@@ atom programme , take this task with regard to all research and development activities that are referred to in this agreement . &quot;
&quot; within the scope of the Eur@@ atom programme , Switzerland is represented by the director of one of the participating laboratories . &quot;
&quot; the committee of directors to monitor the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme and who is responsible for the optimal use of the capacities of the laboratories , which are involved in the work carried out within the programme , will provide this task with respect to all research and development activities that fall under the present agreement . &quot;
he particularly cares for the best possible use of the staff and for the exchange of the same between the laboratories that are involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme and the Swiss programme .
a Swiss representative is entitled to participate in the meetings of all coordin@@ ating committees used within the Eur@@ atom programme .
&quot; the coordination committees , which offer the best possible use of the resources , staff as well as the knowledge and skills involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme , take this task in the respective area with respect to all research and development activities that fall under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; BA@@ F is one of the core and energy research representatives of each member state of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and any associated third country . &quot;
&quot; on request of the Commission , the BA@@ F advises the Commission with regard to the implementation of the programme and any changes in the exec@@ utions as well as in the preparation of future programs and the definition of their overall size , coordination and integration of national activities at community level in the field of fusion . &quot;
&quot; the statements of the BA@@ F , the VG , the Board of Directors , the advis@@ ors and coordination committees have a consult@@ ative character . &quot;
the statement of the VG for the urgent actions is obligatory ; the same applies to the committee of directors in the field of personnel ex@@ changing .
the representatives of the two contracting parties work on the work of all technical advisory boards or all administrative bodies created for the purposes of the present agreement .
&quot; Switzerland &apos;s financial contribution to the Eur@@ atom programme in accordance with this agreement is determined annually on an amount , which is equal to the share of Eur@@ atom &apos;s GDP at the Eur@@ atom &apos;s gross domestic product in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; regarding the J@@ ET project , this financial contribution refers to Eur@@ atom &apos;s participation in the joint venture as soon as this is established . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Switzerland over@@ looks J@@ ET &apos;s common enterprise an amount which is to be determined in accordance with the financial provisions of the stat@@ ute of this common enterprise . &quot;
&quot; the financial contribution which Eur@@ atom provides for financing the work within the association agreement and the agreement on human resource sharing is calculated on the same basis , which is normally used to calculate Eur@@ atom contributions to finance the work , which are made due to the corresponding contracts . &quot;
the Commission shares with the Federal Council at the beginning of the year with which amount to cover expenditure in the framework of the Eur@@ atom programme for the relevant year is fores@@ een .
the Federal Council is paying the amount due to this article as follows : 7 / 12 before 15 January and 5 / 12 before the 15 .
July . the remaining payment methods for Switzerland and Eur@@ atom &apos;s financial contributions in accordance with this article are set in Anne@@ x III to the present agreement .
&quot; Switzerland sei@@ zes all necessary measures to exemp@@ t Eur@@ atom from duties or other duties as well as import restrictions and restrictions on the part of the items financed by Eur@@ atom , which are to be used in Switzerland for activities within the scope of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in Switzerland , or items acquired there may not be sold un@@ paid or free of charge in this country , unless the Federal Council appro@@ ves conditions issued by the Federal Council . &quot;
these liber@@ ations are not applicable to pensions and pensions paid to these individuals .
&quot; the provisions on access to the knowledge applicable to the association envis@@ aged in Article 2 of the present agreement are governed in Article 14 and 15 of this agreement , in the Association Agreement and in the Agreement on Person@@ nel Exchange . &quot;

agreement in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements
the BI@@ S could conclude stand@@ by credit agreements with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries if the banks make a corresponding application .
&quot; the agreement could be closed up to the total amount of the membership fee paid by the credi@@ tor country , and within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion invo@@ icing units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future delivery funds of the member countries . &quot;
&quot; already now , however , some conditions are mentioned below , for which the BI@@ S would be ready . &quot;
&quot; in each Stand@@ by credit , BI@@ S would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of renew@@ ing extensions , without exceeding five years altogether . &quot;
&quot; in the opening of the loans as well as with their event@@ ual extension , the BI@@ S would charge a credit opening commission . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the first draws would not be made before the exp@@ iry of a month after completion of the Stand@@ by Agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity . &quot;
&quot; the drawing would take place in the BI@@ S at the conclusion of the agreement at the disposal of the currencies , very likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods that would be taking into account the funds of the bank , presumably three or six months . &quot;
&quot; the conditions would correspond to those transactions conducted by the BI@@ S at the time under similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would largely correspond to the market value . &quot;
&quot; however , if BI@@ S has to proc@@ ure the necessary means by itself on the market , the interest rate applicable to the application could reach a maximum , corresponding to the corresponding margin of Li@@ bor . &quot;
I would be grateful if you would share with me the consent of the Council of the European Communities .

in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine@@ an Republic on trade with H@@ amm@@ el - and lamb meat
&quot; I honor the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations on the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goats from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goats by the Community . &quot;
&quot; - fresh or cooled sponge - , lamb and goat &apos;s meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ; &quot;
&quot; as part of this agreement , the export possibilities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina after the Community are set to the following annual quantity : 20,000 tons , expressed in battle body weight ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to guarantee a faul@@ t@@ less functioning of the agreement , Argentina is obliged to ensure that the actual quantity of the annual quantity does not exceed the agreed amount and is executed in accordance with conventional forms of supply ( frozen or cooled ) . &quot;
&quot; should a change in the form of supply be possible due to changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement should consult each other prior to the introduction of such a change in the committee mentioned under number 10 in order to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community claims the safeguard clause , it oblig@@ ates itself to ensure that the Argent@@ ine@@ an access to the community market is not affected by this Agreement . &quot;
&quot; in the event that imports from Argentina exceed the agreed amounts in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Argentina for the rest of the year . &quot;
the Community comm@@ its itself to restrict the exhaus@@ tion to imports of products recorded by this agreement to a ho@@ ur@@ ly rate of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; with the entry of new Member States , the community in consultation with Argentina will change the amount set under number 2 according to the scope of Argent@@ inian trade with each new Member State . &quot;
&quot; the import loads for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; in this case , the rate of exhaus@@ tion referred to under the number 5 shall be taken into account . &quot;
&quot; the total quantity mentioned under number 2 is set on the date of the accession of Greece to the community to 23@@ ,000 tonnes of battle body weight . &quot;
the community under@@ takes everything to avoid a market development that could affect the marketing of Argent@@ ine@@ an H@@ amm@@ el and lamb in the joint market within the agreed quantities .
&quot; in particular , the community meets provisions in order to ensure that the sale of inter@@ vention@@ ist conditions on frozen meat is not under@@ mining the sale of Argent@@ ine h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat due to the regulation of the regulation . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual use of funds or other funding measures for the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb as well as from slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lam@@ bs is only at prices and conditions that comply with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional part of the world trade with these products . &quot;
&quot; these terms are to be interpreted in a manner compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular Article 10 ( 2 ) of the Convention for the interpretation and application of Article VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General Custom@@ s and Trade Agreement . &quot;
&quot; Argentina guarantees compliance with this agreement , in particular , in order to grant export licenses for the products specified under the number 1 in this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the Community is obliged to take all necessary precau@@ tions , so that the distribution of import licenses for the aforementioned products depends on the origin in Argentina on the presentation of a export license , which is given by the competent authority designated by the Argent@@ ine@@ an government . &quot;
the details of the application of this system are determined in such a way that the position of a security deposit can be wai@@ ved for the distribution of the import licence for the products .
&quot; in implementing provisions , it is also stipul@@ ated that the competent Argent@@ ine@@ an authority in the competent authority of the Community is reporting the quantities at regular intervals for which export licenses have been issued ; these details may be de@@ cip@@ her@@ ed according to destination country . &quot;
the committee is responsible for ensuring that the agreement is properly applied and works smoothly .
&quot; he regularly reviews the Ten@@ dency on the H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goats meat market of both parties and on the world market as well as the sales conditions on these markets , including the conditions designated for the purpose mentioned under number 7 . &quot;
&quot; the committee is responsible for ensuring that the proper use of this agreement is not affected by the fact that products made from H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat will not be carried out according to the Community under the agreement . &quot;
the committee will discuss all questions arising during the implementation of this agreement and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities .
the provisions of this agreement apply without prejudi@@ ce to the rights and obligations of the parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .

&quot; with an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand on trade with H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat &apos;s meat &quot;
&quot; I honor the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations to establish provisions on the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from New Zealand to the Community in connection with the application of the regulation on a common market organisation for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat . &quot;
&quot; in recognition of the fact that the sheep industry and export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb after the world market , and especially after the community for the New Zealand economy , must be assured that the normal section of New Zealand &apos;s H@@ amm@@ el - and lamb is not affected in these markets , I honour myself to propose the following agreement : &quot;
&quot; the agreement applies to : - fresh or cooled hammer - , lamb - and goat &apos;s meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; this agreement establishes New Zealand for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and go@@ at@@ meat of access to the community market in the amount specified in the agreement . &quot;
new Zealand receives the assurance that the normal paragraph of his h@@ amm@@ el - and lamb meat is not affected by the application of the regulation .
&quot; in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , New Zealand comm@@ its itself to ensure that the actual annual quantity does not exceed the set amount . &quot;
the set quantities are carried out in conventional forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
the community ass@@ ures that New Zealand should not be prevented with this agreement to use new technological developments or to maintain its competitive position on the market of the community .
&quot; should a change in the form of supply be made possible due to changes in technology and trade , the two contractual parties shall consult each other before the introduction of such a change in the committee mentioned in clause 10 in order to find an appropriate solution . &quot;

&quot; in addition , the two Parties undertake everything to promote the consumption of Schaff@@ lei@@ sch in the community without danger to market stability . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual use of funds or other funding measures for the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb as well as from slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lam@@ bs is only at prices and conditions that comply with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional part of the world trade with these products . &quot;
new Zealand warran@@ ts compliance with the quantities stated in clause 2 in particular that there are no export licenses beyond these quantities .
&quot; in its turn , the Community ple@@ dges to take all necessary precau@@ tions in order for the issu@@ ance of import lic@@ ences for the above @-@ mentioned products to be made dependent on the template of a export license issued by the New Zealand government . &quot;
the details of the application of this system are determined in such a way that the position of a security deposit can be wai@@ ved for the distribution of the import licence for the products .
&quot; in implementing provisions , the competent New Zealand authority of the competent authority of the Community periodi@@ cally tells the quantities for which export licenses have been issued ; these data may be de@@ cip@@ her@@ ed according to destination country . &quot;
the committee is responsible for ensuring that the agreement is properly applied and works smoothly .
&quot; the committee regularly reviews the tendency of the hammer - , lamb - and goat &apos;s meat market of both parties and on the world market as well as the sales conditions on these markets , including the conditions specified for the purpose mentioned in clause 7 . &quot;
&quot; the committee is responsible for ensuring that the proper use of the agreement is not affected by the fact that products made from H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat will be carried out according to the Community under the Agreement . &quot;
&quot; the committee shall discuss all the questions arising during the implementation of the agreement , which are presented to him by a contracting party , and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities . &quot;
the provisions of this agreement apply without prejudi@@ ce to the rights and obligations of the contracting parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .

&quot; the volume of red blood cells is to be between 65 and 75 % of the total volume of the product , but if a higher concentration of red blood cells is used , the approximate percentage of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te volume ( ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t ) is indicated on the label . &quot;
&quot; all processes required for the production must be carried out under as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . the fu@@ gation must be carried out using a sterile , closed system and only by pressure . &quot;
&quot; an artificial wat@@ ery solution has been added , so on the label its volume and composition is to be stated . &quot;
the human dry plasma is extracted through de@@ hydr@@ ation of the liquid deposited at centri@@ fu@@ gi@@ zation or sedi@@ mentation of human whole blood .
&quot; human dry plasma is obtained by cold drying , or any other method by den@@ aturing a den@@ atur@@ ation of the proteins . &quot;
&quot; the dry product can easily be dissolved in a quantity of water , which corresponds to the amount of liquid used in the production of the substance . &quot;
&quot; the protein concentration of the solution won &apos;t exceed 45 grams per litre , and the solution must not show any visible signs of hem@@ oly@@ sis products . &quot;
donations in which ( using a fresh serum sample ) have found a dangerous content of iso@@ prop@@ yl or immune hem@@ at@@ glut@@ in@@ ine are excluded .
&quot; if the plasma is not mixed and frozen within 48 hours after the blood withdrawal , the ster@@ ility of each unit must be proven in a quantity of at least 10 ml . &quot;
&quot; in order to eliminate the harmful effects of bacterial growth products in plasma , blood donations , which show signs of bacterial contamination , are not used ; the ster@@ ility of every donation must be proven in a quantity of at least 10 ml . &quot;

a re@@ agent for blood group determination must react with all tested blood samples which contain the an@@ tigen that is hom@@ olog@@ ous to the antibody or another on the label .
&quot; if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) hem@@ oly@@ tic properties ; &quot;
the ti@@ ter is measured with repeated di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to be examined on the double in a suitable medium .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest serum di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; di@@ lution is calculated exclusively by volume of blood cells flow in total volume .
&quot; in case of anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents used on object carriers , activity is expressed by time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier . &quot;
&quot; the World Health Organisation has set standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood group determination International norms , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity are elabor@@ ated at the time of standards . &quot;
&quot; according to definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination of most specific@@ ity is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ ist , which is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te floo@@ ding . &quot;
the ti@@ ter gives the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the last mixture within a series where a micro@@ scopic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
&quot; the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination , available for the international standard preparations ( currently anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as incomplete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the ti@@ tr@@ ation of the unknown re@@ agent in comparison to the International Standard preparation or a state standard preparation in international units ( see Bul@@ letin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 30@@ 1 . ) . &quot;

&quot; if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , the necessary characteristics should be kept for at least one year . &quot;
&quot; the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in fluctu@@ ating form , according to the label , is at most one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test . &quot;
the exp@@ iry date for dry re@@ agents on the label is based on the results of the exp@@ iry trials ; it is approved by the state supervisory authorities .
&quot; dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is closed so that no moisture can penetrate . &quot;
&quot; a dry re@@ agent may lose at most 0,5 l of its weight if it is tested by further drying via phosph@@ or@@ us @-@ pent@@ oxi@@ des in a pressure of no more than 0,@@ 02 mm Hg within 24 hours . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent state authority can determine that the re@@ agent ( or the solvent supplied with the dry re@@ agents ) is an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , provided that the re@@ agent with the added substance continues to obtain the requirements for specific@@ ity and effectiveness . &quot;
sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein per ml of liquid or re @-@ dissolved serum .
&quot; re@@ agents , whether in fluid form or after recovery , must be transparent and may not contain sedi@@ ments or gels or visible particles . &quot;

&quot; re@@ agents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities , that the re@@ agent in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells . &quot;
the quantity in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has written written records on all stages of production and control of re@@ agents for blood group determination .
&quot; adequate samples of all re@@ agents issued are to be stored for so long from the laboratory , until some probability can be assumed that the batch is no longer used . &quot;
&quot; re@@ agents used for blood group determination may contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective percentage , the others are the necessary aids to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain the stability of the re@@ agent . &quot;
&quot; for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are classified according to the origin of their effective approach in three groups . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin only contain substances of human origin , or that animal or herbal re@@ agents cannot contain substances of human origin . &quot;
&quot; each individual container is a black on white printed label in English and French , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer , &quot;

&quot; anti @-@ D Ser@@ a , which are used to use object carriers according to the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination in 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination has to be complete within 120 seconds . &quot;
anti @-@ C serum is obtained from the blood of one or more people immun@@ ised by the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ogen C of the R@@ h system .
&quot; it re@@ acts with floo@@ ding of human red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen C , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the C an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , these Ser@@ a are only specific for C an@@ tigen if the tested blood cells are washed up in a 0.@@ 9 percent sal@@ ine solution . &quot;
the ti@@ ter of the anti @-@ C Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; in@@ complete &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 compared to c@@ c@@ d@@ dee blood cells .
&quot; anti @-@ C Ser@@ a , which are intended for use on object carriers in accordance with the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test ( and do not contain any form of anti @-@ D ) , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination has to be complete within 120 seconds . &quot;
anti @-@ E serum is obtained from the blood of one or more individuals who are immun@@ ised by the an@@ tigen E of the R@@ h system .
anti @-@ E Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; in@@ complete &quot; ) should have a title of at least 1 : 8 versus C@@ c@@ dd@@ E@@ e blood cells .
&quot; anti @-@ E Ser@@ a , which are intended for use on object carriers according to the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test ( and are not allowed in any form anti @-@ D ) , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination has to be completed within 120 seconds . &quot;
the specific@@ ity of the anti @-@ D + -@@ C and the specific@@ ity anti @-@ D + -@@ E can be obtained directly from the blood of immun@@ ised individuals or can be produced by mixing anti @-@ D with anti @-@ C or anti @-@ E serum .
&quot; in a given serum , both antibodies must be effective at the same time under the reaction conditions specified by the manufacturer . &quot;
&quot; if a serum for use on object carriers is determined according to the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test , ag@@ glut@@ ination time in all types of red blood cells , which show a reaction , should not be lower than the ant@@ aneous antibodies . &quot;
anti @-@ A serum is obtained from the blood of animals that can be immun@@ ised by blood cells or specific substances of the group A .
&quot; anti @-@ A serum ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells which contain A @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of the blood @-@ groups A and AB including sub@@ groups A1 , A2 , A@@ 1@@ B and A@@ 2@@ B ; it ag@@ glut@@ inate any human red blood cells that contain no A @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of the blood @-@ groups 0 and B . &quot;
&quot; an anti @-@ A serum is , parallel to the dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the Anti @-@ A blood group serum or a corresponding compar@@ ability , separated by floo@@ ding of A1 , A2 and A@@ 2@@ B red blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ A serum is mixed on an object carrier with an equal amount of 5@@ - to 10 percent in@@ fusion of A@@ 1- , A@@ 2 and A@@ 2@@ B blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination has to occur during any floo@@ ding within the double time required when the same attempt is performed with the re@@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group serum or a standard preparation of the same avi@@ dity . &quot;
anti @-@ B serum is obtained from the blood of animals that can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or specific substances of the blood group B .
&quot; anti @-@ B serum ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells which contain B an@@ tigen ; it does not ag@@ glut@@ inate human red blood cells that contain no B an@@ tigen , i.e. those of the blood @-@ groups 0 and A . &quot;
&quot; an anti @-@ B serum is , parallel to the dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the Anti @-@ B blood group serum or a corresponding compar@@ ability , with an in@@ fusion of blood cells of group B to Tit@@ anic ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ B serum is mixed on an object carrier with an equal amount of 5@@ - to 10 % in@@ fusion of B @-@ blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination has to occur within the double time required when the same attempt is performed with the re@@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group serum or with a standard preparation of the same avi@@ dity . &quot;
anti @-@ Human @-@ Glob@@ ulin serum for use in blood group ser@@ ology has to contain ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating antibodies against Ig@@ G glob@@ ulin and ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating antibodies against complementary factors .
it is extracted from the blood of animals that are immun@@ ised by injection of human serum proteins .
&quot; if it is used according to the manufacturer &apos;s prescription , it does not ag@@ glut@@ inate any in@@ anim@@ ate human red blood cells , regardless of which blood type they belong . &quot;

&quot; an anti @-@ human glob@@ ulin serum has to cause a strong ag@@ glut@@ ination of the red blood cells in the supplied form or in the di@@ lution contained on the label , which are loaded with human in@@ complete anti @-@ D ser@@ a with a Tit@@ er of 1 : 4 ( or less ) when the ti@@ tr@@ ation with D @-@ positive blood cells is performed after the &quot; &quot; alb@@ um@@ in @-@ re@@ plac@@ ements &quot; &quot; method . &quot;
&quot; in the same di@@ lution , the highly sensi@@ ti@@ zed K @-@ positive human red blood cells and the F@@ ya @-@ positive red blood cells , sensi@@ ti@@ zed by the weak anti @-@ F@@ ya antibodies , have to ag@@ glut@@ inate the infected F@@ ya @-@ positive red blood cells . &quot;

&quot; based on Article 5 paragraph 1 of the Convention , the Parties shall &quot; &quot; meet all necessary measures &quot; &quot; to free the therapeutic substances of human origin provided by the other parties , from all input charges ; &quot;
&quot; whereas for the Member States of the European Economic Community the obligation to grant this release falls into the jurisdiction of the community , which , according to the Treaty by which it was founded , has the necessary powers to do so ; &quot;
&quot; from the time of its entry into force , this additional protocol is part of the Convention . from this point on , a state cannot become the contracting party of the Convention without becoming the contracting party of the Additional Protocol . &quot;
&quot; the Secretary General of the Council of Europe noti@@ fies the Member States of the Council of Europe , all the States and the European Economic Community , as well as any objection or objection in accordance with Article 2 and the time of entry into force of this Additional Protocol pursuant to Article 2 . &quot;

&quot; based on the common declaration adopted by the Ministers of EF@@ TA countries and Member States of the Community , as well as by the Commission of the European Communities on 9 April 1984 in Luxembourg , in particular with regard to the simpli@@ fication of the boundary conditions and the rules of origin , &quot;
&quot; in DER &apos;s estim@@ ation that the Community has decided within the action program to strengthen the internal market , as of January 1 , 1988 , to introduce a unified administrative package for domestic goods transport , &quot;
&quot; in DER weighing that it is appropriate to simplify the transfer of goods between the Community and EF@@ TA countries as well as between the EF@@ TA countries , in particular by the introduction of a single administration api@@ ary , &quot;
&quot; in DER &apos;s estim@@ ation , that this agreement must not be interpreted to the extent that it ent@@ ails the contracting parties of their obligations from other international conventions - &quot;
&quot; in this agreement , measures are set to simplify the transfer of goods between the Community and EF@@ TA countries as well as between the EF@@ TA countries ; in particular , a unified administrative paper ( herein@@ after referred to as &quot; shipping method &quot; ) is introduced . &quot;
&quot; the form@@ alities associated with goods transport between the contracting parties are authorised by means of a single sheet , for which preliminary print@@ outs are to be used in Anne@@ x I to this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the single paper is used as an application or paper for export , shipping or import@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; - to be expressly requested for the implementation of legislation applicable in a contracting party , whose application should not be guaranteed in the sole use of the single document ; &quot;
&quot; - to be requested by the participants , so that they can come to the enjoyment of a part or a certain relief . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This Convention does not prevent the Parties to apply simplified procedures , including the use of data processing , with regard to further facil@@ itation for the parties involved . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) Simp@@ li@@ fied procedures can , in particular , fores@@ ee that the goods concerned are not subject to a customs office and the registration for these goods must not be submitted to the customs office ; furthermore , the submission of an incomplete registration can be allowed . &quot;
&quot; in these cases , an application must subsequently be filed in which it may act with the consent of the competent authorities in order to report periodi@@ c collection notification within the period stipul@@ ated by these authorities . &quot;
in cases of paragraph 1 it may be allowed to use instead of the single api@@ ary commercial paper .
&quot; if the declaration paper is used , the parties with the consent of the competent authorities may add to the stock@@ pil@@ es associated with export and import@@ ation instead of the supple@@ mental sheets in the trade common lists in which the goods are described . &quot;
&quot; - to conclude agreements or agreements with regard to further simpli@@ fication of the responsibilities for their entire goods transport , or for sub @-@ areas ; &quot;
&quot; - for consi@@ gn@@ ments which include several types of goods , to replace the form@@ alities in the shipping method Lad@@ eli@@ sts instead of the supplementary sheets for a single paper ; &quot;
&quot; - allowing applications to be created by public or private data processing equipment according to the conditions specified by the competent authorities , if necessary ; &quot;
&quot; - to allow the relevant authorities to enter the data required to provide the relevant information in their data processing systems for the treatment of applications , and , if necessary , without submitting a written application ; &quot;
&quot; - allow the relevant authorities to see in the event of the use of a data processing system for the treatment of applications , that the export , shipping or import registration is done either by the single document created by this system or , if such a paper is not created , by entering the data into the data processing plant ; &quot;
&quot; - to apply for facil@@ itation , which were adopted by the Joint Committee in the way of a resolution pursuant to Article 11 paragraph 3 . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) In App@@ endi@@ x II , the provisions on the provision of the form@@ alities necessary for export , shipping and import of goods are laid down in Anne@@ x II to this Convention . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) The common codes , which are to be used in the resolutions listed in the App@@ endi@@ x I , shall be found in Anne@@ x III to this Convention . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) The registration shall be made in one of the official languages of the contracting parties , approved by the competent authorities of the country in which the provisions for export or shipping will be carried out . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , the customs authority of the country of destination or transit country may request a translation of the registration into the official language or any of the official languages of this country . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) De@@ vi@@ ously from paragraph 1 , registration must always be made in one of the official languages of the import country , if in this country , using other than that of the customs office of the export or exit country , the registration takes place . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) The applicant or his representative can use for each individual proced@@ ural section of a commodity exchange between the contracting parties , which may be included only in this section of the required cre@@ denti@@ als , which may be included in the following sections if necessary . &quot;
( 2 ) The use of paragraph 1 must not be linked to a special condition of the relevant authorities .
&quot; however , without prejudi@@ ce to the special provisions on collecting consi@@ gn@@ ments , the competent authorities can see , however , that the provisions for export and shipping procedures can be carried out on one and the same pressure by means of the copies envis@@ aged for these form@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; in the cases of Article 7 , the competent authorities are convinced , as far as possible , that the data contained in the copies of the registration in the individual proceedings are consistent . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) The customs authorities of these countries , if they are interested in any other contracting party ( including administrative reports ) , present each other at request or in order to facilitate the un@@ covering of ir@@ regul@@ arities or infrin@@ gements . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) The administrative assistance may be denied or rejected in full or in part , if the desired country of view is that the administrative assistance would viol@@ ate its security , public order ( &quot; or@@ dre public &quot; ) or other essential interests , or viol@@ ate an operating , business or professional sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) In the case of ref@@ using or rej@@ ecting the administrative assistance , the appropriate decision and its grounds are irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able to the seeking country . &quot;
&quot; ( 4 ) If the customs authority of a country is seeking administrative assistance , which she herself could not afford , if she would ask for it , she points in her request for this circum@@ stance . &quot;
&quot; ( 5 ) The information received in paragraph 1 shall only be used for the purposes of this Convention and shall enjoy the protection , which the national law of the country which it has received is granted for information of this kind . &quot;
&quot; these information may only be used with written consent of the customs authority , which it has given , and subject to the restrictions imposed by this authority . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) A mixed committee shall be used , in which each contracting party is represented by this Convention . &quot;
&quot; ( 4 ) The Committee shall establish a business order , which regul@@ ates the conven@@ ing of meetings as well as the appointment of the chairman and the duration of his term of office . &quot;
( 5 ) The Committee may use sub@@ committees and work@@ groups that support him in his tasks .
( 1 ) The Committee shall have the task of managing this Convention and ensuring its proper application .
&quot; to do this , the committee shall regularly inform the parties about practical experiences with the application of the Convention ; he speaks recommendations and sum@@ mar@@ ises 3 resolutions in cases of paragraph 3 . &quot;
( 3 ) The Committee shall make changes to the app@@ endi@@ ces to this Convention as well as the facil@@ itation mentioned in Article 4 ( 3 ) of the last line of thought .
&quot; ( 4 ) If the representative of a contracting party in the Gem@@ is@@ chten Committee has accepted a resolution under the provis@@ o of the provision of the constitu@@ tionally required conditions , the decision shall come into effect on the first day of the second month , on the first day of the second month after notification of the suspension of the reservation . &quot;
&quot; each contracting party will take appropriate measures to ensure effective and well @-@ balanced implementation of this agreement , with the need to take into account the difficulties bearing goods traffic as far as possible and to supply satisfactory solutions in the application of the provisions of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This Convention applies to the areas in which the Treaty is applied to the establishment of the European Economic Community , and on the one hand , as well as for the territories of EF@@ TA countries on the other . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) This Convention also applies to the Princip@@ ality of Liechtenstein , as long as the Princip@@ ality is associated with the Swiss Con@@ federation by a customs agreement contract . &quot;
&quot; each contracting party may termin@@ ate this agreement with a twelve @-@ month term ; the written notice shall be directed to the de@@ posit@@ aries mentioned in Article 17 , notified to all other contractual parties . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This Convention enters into force on 1 January 1988 , provided that the Parties concluded their acceptance certificates in the Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities by November 1 , 1987 . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) If this Convention does not enter into force on 1 January 1988 , it will take effect on the first day of the second month after the last acquisition of the acceptance certificate . &quot;
&quot; this agreement is written in a script in Danish , German , English , Finnish , French , Greek , Icel@@ an@@ dic , Italian , Dutch , Norwegian , Portuguese , Swedish and Spanish ; it is deposited in the Archives of the Council of the European Communities . &quot;
I allow myself to propose the following agreement which will serve as the basis for cooperation between the European Economic Community and the International Council for Marine Research .
&quot; 1 . the European Economic Community , represented by its Commission , herein@@ after called &quot; Commission , &quot; may ask the International Council for Marine Research , herein@@ after &quot; Council , &quot; to ask recommendations regarding the management of fish stocks and related issues , and the Council will follow this request as far as possible . &quot;
&quot; 2 . in view of the Commission &apos;s responsibility in matters of management of fish stocks , the Council agrees to present all relevant reports of its working groups to estimate the stock and report of its advisory board of fisheries . &quot;
&quot; 3 . the Council and the Commission regularly advise on how the cooperation between the two parties is intensified , and in particular investigate the possibilities of the Commission to establish a closer link to the Council &apos;s advisory board committee . &quot;
&quot; 4 . upon signing this agreement , the Community will pay a sum of 3@@ 76 000 D@@ KR and then make annual payments . &quot;
&quot; the annual fee does not include the costs for meetings , which are conven@@ ed at the special request of the Commission . &quot;
&quot; 5 . three years after the entry into force of this agreement , the provisions of both parties shall be reviewed once more . &quot;
&quot; if no new provisions are agreed , the agreement shall be extended on the basis of the existing provisions until new agreements have been negotiated . &quot;
&quot; each party has the possibility to res@@ ign from the agreement at any time , subject to a period of notice of notice . &quot;
&quot; with regard to clause 3 , the Council agrees to recognise the observer status at meetings of the Advisory Committee on Fish@@ eries Management of the Council . &quot;
&quot; in this capacity , the representative of the Commission would have the right to ask the word and participate in the meetings , but would not have the right to vote and not the possibility to change the agen@@ das of the meetings . &quot;
I would be grateful if you would inform me if these agreements are acceptable as the basis of a cooperation between your Council and the Community for you .
I assume that this letter and your answer to this are the agreement on cooperation between the International Council of Marine Research and the European Economic Community .
